1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,730
hello everybody thank you very much for

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,029
coming as Bradley said I'm Jasmine

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,559
Brackett Cindy this is Erica L his audio

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
engineer and also a hardware engineer

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,610
she's also contracting for supply for

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,170
him at the moment I'm working here in

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,490
the design lab and so you might have

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,160
seen her demos down in the loading dock

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,680
earlier this poor beach her PO Maroney

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,130
he's head of the pirates factory in

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,220
Sheffield and also Spencer own who's the

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,390
creator of the RC 2014 which is a z80

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,300
z80 sorry we're in the States now the

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,719
CAC retro computer which is available on

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,559
tindy so thanks very much so to start

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,629
this panel this panel is basically about

17
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,850
different creators and how they've take

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,760
brought products to market and their

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,289
journeys along the way and they've got

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,940
quite different and varied backgrounds

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,470
so Erica how did you start why am i

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,689
joking right now I started working with

23
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:19,770
hardware electronics in my early in my

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,799
late teenage years early 20s in

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,009
recording studios I was fascinated by

26
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,090
the creative process and wanted to have

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,200
a reason to be in there and realize that

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,210
nobody wanted to fix anything so if I

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,060
could then that would be great so that's

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,130
how I got started was wanting to be

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,740
closer to recording and captured music

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,740
and the gear behind it so I I mess with

33
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,290
home computers in the 80s and learned

34
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,930
pretty much nothing I wrote things but

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,210
couldn't put them back together and then

36
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,460
kind of a maker movement I'm wanting to

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,710
have a quadcopter before they were cheap

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,350
and ubiquitous allowed me to kind of

39
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,419
actually learn something and from there

40
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,130
on it was kind

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,580
right place right time and the ethic to

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,580
kind of do stuff but my background is

43
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,730
more for a year Network Engineer side of

44
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,920
things never intended to be an

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,590
electrical engineer but I accidentally

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,170
design a little z80 base computer I

47
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,850
could maybe share the PCBs with a couple

48
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,220
of friends before I knew it I'm all

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,110
doing more PCBs which I know or

50
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,420
they need to start selling to make the

51
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,220
money back on them which you where did

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,440
becomes into it so I kind of

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
accidentally fell into the fact that now

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,860
yeah four years later my day job is

55
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,430
selling sending retro computer kids even

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,810
though it's not it's not what I'm school

57
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,580
to qualify did but it's what of what

58
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:07,120
I've come to do say all these three so

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,440
Spencer is a one-man band pull pin

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,380
Maroney is a factory in Sheffield and

61
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,410
you've got like 30-something 37

62
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,860
employees and erica's works a lot as a

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,240
contractor but also in different

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,710
organizations working with other

65
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,780
hardware engineers I said they've got

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,840
quite different backgrounds for this as

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,450
you were developing your careers or

68
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,240
businesses what was the resource or

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,460
person or group that helps you the most

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,120
nonstop with Paul that's a really hard

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,380
question so I think having people you

72
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,000
can work with and bounce knowledge of

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,590
having that having that community I'm

74
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,300
trying to remember specific people but

75
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,319
it was just the Internet right

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,569
it's just the Internet it's just other

77
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,430
people's brains yeah yeah making

78
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,530
connections online is very very much

79
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,840
it's but finding your local peer group

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,389
who you can work with you get along with

81
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,989
you enable you who push you yeah that

82
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:20,320
helps build things for B as well worried

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,970
so so Twitter was absolutely fantastic

84
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,919
lots of lots of great people out there

85
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,440
as well as podcast yeah things like the

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,880
air power which I assume everyone here

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,070
listens to anyway but yeah without the

88
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,789
air power word without a eevblog I

89
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,630
definitely wouldn't be where I am today

90
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,759
so it was it was through things like

91
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,120
that that really helped me get a product

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,060
to market which I wouldn't it would have

93
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,580
to do without that yeah one particular

94
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,720
video from the AEV blog is it's it's

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,669
entirely based about how to how to price

96
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,039
your products so just know that

97
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,599
yeah it's not just the cost of the bill

98
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,880
of materials it's the cost of the bill

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,710
of materials Plus this Plus that you've

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,880
got to take into account all of the

101
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,630
other factors so yeah I would highly

102
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,449
recommend checking out the videos of

103
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,659
Dave Jones lots lots of lots of other

104
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,039
different resources out there as well

105
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,020
okay for me it's quite different I think

106
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,729
that finding the people who did it the

107
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,380
best and making friends with them

108
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,070
stalking them learning from them was

109
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,110
probably the best resource and I would

110
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,360
always find them from conferences or

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,550
actually showing up in person to talks

112
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,570
or finding them online but definitely

113
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,740
reaching out to the people who were

114
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,300
already making the thing that I wanted

115
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,250
to make or be a part of making friends

116
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,199
with them and then figuring it out from

117
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,030
there iterating on their designs

118
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,860
figuring out what was wrong making it

119
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,090
better so yeah like go straight to the

120
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,610
top find find the people who are already

121
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,820
doing something similar and and make

122
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,039
friends so in terms of getting a product

123
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,830
from your workbench into the hands of

124
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,590
the people that you want to use them can

125
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,340
you think

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,810
a time what's the kind of worse

127
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,130
situation that you've been in what's the

128
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:22,380
worst case that you've been on yeah that

129
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,949
was very only odd but my products ended

130
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,080
up being featured on hackaday yeah being

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,639
 patron heck days absolutely

132
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,669
fantastic what it does mean though is

133
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,630
that you get far too many orders so that

134
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,400
being able to prepare for that being

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,190
able to have enough stock it was was was

136
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,600
the biggest issue for me because all of

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,919
a sudden there's loads of people that

138
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,889
could see my product on hackaday and

139
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,690
they go to go to Sydney to buy it it's

140
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,860
out of stock so just knowing what parts

141
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,110
you've got to place orders two three

142
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,270
four weeks in advance knowing which

143
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,440
other parts that you could leave you

144
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,380
until a day or two before head but once

145
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,000
once you've got it that worked out he's

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,010
not too bad you know what what stock

147
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,050
levels you likely to to need but early

148
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,430
odd that what there was a major issue

149
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,970
for me

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,640
oh there's so many so many I'm trying to

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,110
pick which one okay so the question is

152
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,750
worse mistakes okay the worst mistake I

153
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,260
ever made I think that stays with me was

154
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,380
not providing a torque spec for a six

155
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,720
layer board that a contract manufacturer

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,320
was assembling and it resulted in the

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,240
people who were assembling it cracking

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,310
traces on the board and then a team of

159
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,810
us having to manually fix them over the

160
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,240
course of like three days to be able to

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,850
meet the deadline for delivery to the

162
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,340
client of the product so yeah the devil

163
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,570
is in the details and if you're

164
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,530
interested in building products

165
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,560
designing products then eric has done a

166
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,780
talk at super conference in a previous

167
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,790
year which is mistakes that push you

168
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,960
forward it was good mistakes will move

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,190
you forward and you should definitely

170
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,930
watch that as well what do you feel that

171
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,740
you've done that's made the most impact

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,289
who wants to answer that first easy

173
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,270
answer it's the thing that got pin Roni

174
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,200
started it was the Raspberry Pi logo

175
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
everything that's good in my life has

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,340
spanned from that and it's it's freaking

177
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,930
everywhere

178
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,480
30 million bores to in space so I use

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,460
that to kind of other graphic designers

180
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,500
just like is your logo in space I think

181
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,680
not

182
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,020
it gives me validation and when I it's

183
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,250
more confidence when I speak to people

184
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,990
even though it's this one bit of luck I

185
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,000
have and that's that's that all of the

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,260
conversations start from that and then

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,850
it gets easier and you can talk about

188
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,350
the stuff you actually care about and

189
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,520
love and that's that's good I just want

190
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
to say like whenever you can say your

191
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,340
 is in space you know you have

192
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:26,550
arrived they were probably he said one

193
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,180
single thing that has has actually

194
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,700
changed it's just a whole combination of

195
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,020
lots of things lots of eating the right

196
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,790
place at the right time talking to the

197
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,700
right people yeah I don't I don't think

198
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,860
there is just the one thing that

199
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,230
happened to work it all not to see other

200
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:51,240
than other just sheer luck I think the

201
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
thing for me that's had the most impact

202
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
is is getting out of my comfort zone and

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,140
also letting go of control of situations

204
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,750
it's particularly with the team so two

205
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,300
parts the first thing is when I don't

206
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,160
know something or I'm scared or I'm

207
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,840
afraid of it like talking to other

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,190
people and getting out of my comfort

209
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,490
zone to be able to figure it out has had

210
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,200
the most impact and that's hard

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,990
sometimes because for all of the reasons

212
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,620
the second thing is being open to other

213
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,130
people's approaches to solving different

214
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,500
problems on a product that I'm working

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,260
on or that I'm responsible for so I

216
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,720
think the two things that have to have

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,030
had the most impact for me are get get

218
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,190
awkward get uncomfortable and like ask

219
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,020
questions even when you're afraid and

220
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,290
also trust your team that they might

221
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,120
actually have a better idea than you do

222
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,470
that's yeah I think that's definitely a

223
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,660
great thing Spencer says there's no one

224
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,410
particular thing but as a person who

225
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,620
sees his tindy sales and how he deals

226
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,600
with customers through the tindy system

227
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,750
one of the things is Spencer he

228
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,550
mentioned how to price your product

229
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,950
properly make sure you have good margins

230
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,600
but

231
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,490
also the ability if anything goes wrong

232
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,459
if anything when you send out a product

233
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,690
if it doesn't arrive or there's a

234
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,920
problem with it being able to deal with

235
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,990
that swiftly and make it so that it's

236
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,569
not a pain in the ass for him the

237
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:31,540
customer or us is amazing and say you're

238
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,670
you'll been in your careers for a while

239
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,060
indifferent you've quite in at least a

240
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,220
good few years for each of you I feel

241
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,970
like you're very positive people and we

242
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,329
I feel like you would do it again is

243
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,350
there anything that you would do

244
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,630
differently or why are you enjoying it

245
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:03,860
so much at the moment anybody I think

246
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,019
definitely the last kind of seven years

247
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,690
up in Maroney is make it a little more

248
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,790
time for myself and the personal

249
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,680
projects the passion stuff

250
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,410
I definitely neglected that just because

251
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,639
the pressure of that's always something

252
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,800
you should be doing and that will never

253
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,540
really change when you're doing your

254
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,689
thing and you're upfront and responsible

255
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,199
for it but always make time for yourself

256
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,459
the alternative is pretty bad for this

257
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:38,600
all I think you know obviously yes yes

258
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,230
it would do this again but for a part of

259
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,209
the joy of this to me has been how

260
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,410
things have just folded in the right

261
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,579
place at the right time but it's all

262
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,829
worked out great if what I thought about

263
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,750
this in a sensible way for a said right

264
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,579
from the outset okay I want to sell X

265
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,139
amount of units I want to do this I want

266
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,000
to have a business plan and stuff I

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,589
really don't think the things would have

268
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,300
worked out the way they did I don't

269
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,800
think I could have played exactly what

270
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,819
happened therefore

271
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,660
just to go with the flow so you see what

272
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,189
happens twice um thing if this works

273
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:10,790
yeah great go with that so he can't just

274
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,649
recreate that you can't say oh yeah I'll

275
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,810
plan to just be lucky again with this

276
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,730
time or I'll plan to just bump into this

277
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,699
right person at the right time so but

278
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,199
yeah give it give it give it a chance to

279
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,580
do it all again absolutely I would

280
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,220
yeah I feel the same way I don't think I

281
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,740
would change anything actually and

282
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,520
because it's what's brought me here I do

283
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,110
really appreciate what you said though

284
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,800
because when I reflect on you know 20

285
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,310
years like yeah I really I really put

286
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,380
some of my passion projects to the side

287
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,820
to execute other people's ideas and it

288
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,720
was really worth it but ultimately I

289
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,370
would I would do it I would do it all

290
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:09,230
again in a second quite a while say what

291
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,440
excites you about the electronics injury

292
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,030
or the industry all that maker movement

293
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,160
now and what are you looking forward to

294
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,030
in the in the immediate future if not

295
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,010
the long-term

296
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,870
is anybody accessibility it's so rad to

297
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,810
me like how especially this panel this

298
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,980
conference and everything that's

299
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,530
happening I think it's really incredible

300
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,390
how many resources that we do have

301
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,510
available to us that was before or at

302
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,540
least historically in my experience like

303
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,820
precious or you had to go and find this

304
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,860
person or these people but now you have

305
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,110
this entire library this open source

306
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,790
community events like this where you can

307
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,860
have access to materials and resources

308
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,040
to build and make whatever it is that

309
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,190
you want to and the community behind you

310
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,680
to help you execute those ideas I think

311
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,620
that's really exciting and I'm most

312
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,780
interested in seeing what people in the

313
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,720
makers community and in the engineering

314
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,670
community at large will do about you

315
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,880
know data how we manage it

316
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,279
it's a lot of things which is which is

317
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,750
actually made my products possible is

318
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,270
things like open-source software like

319
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,490
like like AK I care dorky cared which

320
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,620
ever what you prefer

321
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,710
the availability of really cheap PCB

322
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,930
subside I think things like that have

323
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,700
open opened up opportunities for me but

324
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,770
the yeah that thing things like the the

325
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,160
the cost of FPGA is coming right down

326
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,560
the open tool chains for FPGAs means

327
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,050
that as things are going on it's getting

328
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,900
much easier much simpler with with much

329
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,870
lower barriers to entry so yeah it's

330
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,000
things like that which do which do do it

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,290
excitement it's gonna be a lot of good

332
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,560
good stuff coming out because of those

333
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
yeah the the the the accessibility of

334
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,000
the open stuff there so yeah the the

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,060
exchange of information is great and the

336
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,680
community is starting to do things like

337
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,080
play with rocket motors and interesting

338
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,870
ways I am propulsion in a way that never

339
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,370
would have been possible before like you

340
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,740
say but the the kind of flip side to

341
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,529
that is we've got two ways of kind of

342
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,850
saving as the planet the race one is to

343
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,980
consume less and save the planet and the

344
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,470
other way is kind of engineering our way

345
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,970
out of it which may or may not work but

346
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,459
I think for that to happen we've got to

347
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,380
be kind of less Precious about ourselves

348
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,810
as humans in the right way in the way

349
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,300
that pushes progress because we've got

350
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,550
this thing where when it comes to things

351
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,950
that can do great harm but need more

352
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,619
research we get kind of ethically tam

353
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,109
down while simultaneously if we can say

354
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,510
that the various ways that communities

355
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,390
and governments really don't care about

356
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,010
humans that much and it should be the

357
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,640
other way around

358
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,800
care about the community the experience

359
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,140
but now some more flexibility there when

360
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,140
we're trying to go to Mars or whatever

361
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,490
and stop having that your standard about

362
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,980
progress versus how we pretend to care

363
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,990
about people so care about people in the

364
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,000
right way but allow some more risk in

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,580
pushing humanity forwards and real

366
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,650
progress which probably involves trying

367
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,059
to leave the planet sooner rather than

368
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,940
later

369
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,860
I could not agree more everything you

370
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,929
just said I think it's really important

371
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,179
to like press on that that we consider

372
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,529
that when we're designing and making

373
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,960
things what the speculative future is of

374
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,669
that design how it will impact people

375
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,649
and what it means for the earth and

376
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,870
everybody else anyways

377
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,309
I second that that's quite a yeah it's

378
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,529
definitely it's quite broad kind of

379
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,019
looking to the future but if somebody

380
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,500
was starting out build they've come up

381
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,559
with an idea and they want to make a

382
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,350
hardware product what a piece of advice

383
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,149
would you give them or what would what

384
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,590
piece of ice advice would you've given

385
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,679
yourself when you first start it they'll

386
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,889
often fail hard to fail publicly just go

387
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:37,519
don't stop it's gonna mess up a lot it's

388
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,259
gonna be expensive it's gonna be so much

389
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,490
more expensive than you think it's gonna

390
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,840
be and it's gonna take so much more time

391
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,460
than you think it's gonna be and you're

392
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,529
gonna think you're dumb a lot but you're

393
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,120
not just keep at it and the really cool

394
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,950
thing about engineering and hardware in

395
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,929
particular is that there is always an

396
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:56,029
answer and you will find it and someone

397
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,679
will help you get there if you can't if

398
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,399
the if the only alternative to two to

399
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,940
Toyota is to not try it try it it's that

400
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,230
so what have you got to lose

401
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,019
okay dignity buddy stuff like that but

402
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,220
no it is absolutely worthwhile give it a

403
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,129
toy yeah I think I've noticed that

404
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,259
people have clever ideas and they're

405
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,750
often inspired things but also a lot of

406
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,460
it's to do with experience and knowing

407
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,009
actually practically how to get those

408
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:35,480
things sorted out I think that's all the

409
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,940
questions that I have today we're gonna

410
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,519
do a hardware meetup outside in the

411
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,769
alley in the workshop area which is as

412
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,509
you go out that door its directly there

413
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,490
so if you have any hardware that you

414
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,309
want to share and give away or also if

415
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,629
you just have hardware that you don't

416
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:51,810
want to give away but you want to

417
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,700
demo and just talk to other people and

418
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,760
tindy sellers and tindy buyers and or

419
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,140
you just want to show us some cool

420
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,480
projects we'd love to see you there and

421
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,860
I'd like to thank you very much for

422
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,870
coming and I'd like to thank Erica Poole

423
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,030
and Spencer and if you have any more

424
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,470
questions for them they'll be out there

425
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:17,160
to you thank you very much we weren't

426
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,860
doing quick Q&A but we have some time if

427
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,740
anybody has any questions no okay

428
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:35,220
soda soda hey fine so you mentioned like

429
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,860
the torque specs not being specified and

430
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,210
them ruining your boards that's

431
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,290
something a lot of people that haven't

432
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,520
gone to production like you know

433
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,280
wouldn't realize are there any other

434
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,610
that or DFM type things that you know

435
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,100
make it really hard to go from prototype

436
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,169
to you get what I'm saying

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,840
control procedures are so important so

438
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,720
make videos make sure you document every

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,050
single thing about your you can start it

440
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,760
with prototyping right you can just

441
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,550
start documenting filming your process

442
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,590
and what you're doing and then review it

443
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,660
in your design review create your

444
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,370
control procedures and just see what

445
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,200
you've left out so that anybody who's

446
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,580
making it that doesn't give a about

447
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,600
it won't break it

448
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,910
yeah things will change on you you you

449
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,050
won't have tested it in the right

450
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,630
conditions so we test in Sheffield UK

451
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,160
which is pretty temperate and then they

452
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,600
will get sent out to places that are

453
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,850
really hot or really cold and we totally

454
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,040
overlooked that we just didn't think of

455
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,690
it sometimes often because we're moving

456
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,240
too fast we we just have very bare-bones

457
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,150
procedures compared to it's like the tox

458
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,160
thing it it's like that's not even on

459
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:53,490
our radar yeah but things like that will

460
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,750
catch you out and don't assume your

461
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,430
parts will always be the same

462
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,720
because something will change that you

463
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,160
know nothing about and suddenly your

464
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,270
latest batch of parts

465
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,280
they'll have changed and yeah you've

466
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,480
just got to be eternally vigilant

467
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:24,779
so ws2812 caught you out did it anyway

468
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,639
it definitely helps people know what

469
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,700
what we how to use your thing and it

470
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,240
makes it so much easier to that for

471
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,340
people to adopt it so any other

472
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:47,649
questions Oh Joseph how much marketing

473
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:50,139
did you guys have to do our side of

474
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,250
tindy to get your product get noticed

475
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,379
Spencer see anyone that's attendee

476
00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,779
seller pull very successful zone and

477
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,700
Erica generally works with in companies

478
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,559
that have a different marketing um but

479
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:11,169
if anybody so the the majority of market

480
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:13,149
as his beat has been either either

481
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,509
online through Twitter I do I do retire

482
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,460
courage people to tweet about their

483
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,500
Astley 2014 kids where they get them I

484
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,210
would always be tweet them people like a

485
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,980
retweet that means that other people see

486
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,529
them so so so for me that's worked

487
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,490
really well with marketing I do also use

488
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,490
Google AdWords as well and I know that

489
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,110
if I focus now at a particular country

490
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,509
or particular area of the world I seem

491
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,460
to be getting a lot of orders in FOB

492
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,720
there so that works really well things

493
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,610
like that things like that being what

494
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,799
page of hackaday doesn't doesn't hurt so

495
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,200
but you know it's not it's not something

496
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,419
that you could just make that happen but

497
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:56,049
if it does that is also good for for

498
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,250
were people to find out about your

499
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,149
things I also try to go to as many live

500
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,250
events as I can do I go to make affairs

501
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,190
I go to retro computer shows I go you

502
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,279
know about here today so it all helps to

503
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,870
spread the bird so people that may not

504
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,700
have heard about my stuff they might

505
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,200
hear about it there they might go home

506
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,669
but look it up on you today say oh

507
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:18,110
actually yes I know someone who would

508
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,960
so yeah for me that's the kind of market

509
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,730
either be choice which I'll focus order

510
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,420
I think I'd spin the question around a

511
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,640
little bit because we don't do we do the

512
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
Google AdWords we don't do much formal

513
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,570
marketing but I think the best thing we

514
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,270
ever did was kind of being genuine being

515
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,799
passionate and choosing the right

516
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,470
customers so I think pepperonis ended up

517
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,380
with the right customers sometimes very

518
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,910
rarely we fire customers who are the

519
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,520
wrong type and that was the best

520
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,610
decision as a brand just being genuine

521
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,590
joyful and having customers who play

522
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,970
along with that who were human

523
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,490
you don't shout to a sport staff or if

524
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,320
they do they only shout once we respond

525
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,510
nicely and they suddenly say oh hang on

526
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,549
you're not going you're not going to rip

527
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,350
me off that's great okay we can have a

528
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,330
fluffy conversation now that was kind of

529
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,020
the best marketing choice and yeah not

530
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,640
marketing it has its downside but that's

531
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,200
when it feels best in that but that's

532
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,929
when life feels best as a company I

533
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,809
think it's important I can't answer this

534
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,299
because I've never had to think of

535
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,130
marketing pulse is there a new marketing

536
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,169
but they have a very strong brand that

537
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,330
if you go to their website or you buy

538
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,220
any of their products there's just a

539
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,559
sense of joy when you look at that site

540
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,260
or you look at their products they're

541
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,390
colorful they're easy like they're

542
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,890
straight they're intuitive they're not

543
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,390
necessarily easy to you well they are

544
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,100
easy to use but they're intuitive more

545
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,960
like you can do complex things but

546
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,570
they're inviting and accessible in that

547
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,880
way there's a lot of thought done to the

548
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,809
product design to make it that way any

549
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,380
more questions a good point

550
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,450
word-of-mouth and when you make a good

551
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,520
product it kind of sells itself in some

552
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,740
ways right we police ourselves we we

553
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,870
kind of vet each other through these

554
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,700
events and things and that's that's so

555
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,350
important and we don't really talk about

556
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,450
it overtly but it's happening out there

557
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,340
and that's such a good thing is having

558
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,920
an immune system to kind of over leaking

559
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,020
interests and it's one of the killer

560
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,700
things that keeps us kind of gives us

561
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,570
long term appeal and love and the reason

562
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,340
we keep coming yeah I think it's not the

563
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,660
things that they do and the people that

564
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,590
they help and the groups that they help

565
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,110
it comes back even though like when they

566
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,660
turn up events or they support different

567
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,090
you know organizations that are trying

568
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:03,169
to teach people how to use hardware it's

569
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,990
not it's not necessarily going to

570
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,299
directly generate revenue but it helps

571
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,460
with your reputation and the fact that

572
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,220
you just want to help people yeah I was

573
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,880
wondering how you deal with FCC

574
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,809
certifications and things like that or

575
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,419
make sure you are exempt from that or

576
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:31,130
avoid needing to do that so we had a pre

577
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,919
panel conference in the bar and we

578
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,360
decided that we'd answer this question

579
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,780
through interpretive dance no we had

580
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:46,960
serious answers to this as well yeah yes

581
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:08,470
I hope answers your question yeah so

582
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,570
okay the serious answer is as soon as

583
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,220
you start shipping that's customers you

584
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,950
for any number of reasons especially now

585
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,740
with our hs3 reach you should be having

586
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,510
certifications there the documentation

587
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,850
that would absolutely kill just about

588
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,030
everything people do here

589
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,350
unfortunately the enforcement tends to

590
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,580
be reactive not proactive and given

591
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,200
we're all pretty well knowledge here and

592
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
we all care about things like not

593
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,929
knocking out power grids or kids yeah it

594
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:40,840
works out okay and theoretically if you

595
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,370
were to take a rule of thumb if you're

596
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,260
making below 100 of something of a low

597
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,600
cost low voltage item don't worry about

598
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,790
it too much and everyone's cool about it

599
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,040
everyone understands and if there is a

600
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,660
problem people generally are mortified

601
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,179
and will fix it once you get over to

602
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,860
making a thousand of a thing up to ten

603
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,690
thousands that's when you should do the

604
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,030
full FCC process it's gonna cost it's

605
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,559
gonna hurt but you're making the money

606
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,450
to do that hopefully by then and that

607
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,890
seems to be a reasonable approach that

608
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,070
works not the you know officially we of

609
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,049
course always do the FCC and see all the

610
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:19,000
time just like everyone else I agree

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,610
with everything and everything you just

612
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,380
said so I really have nothing more to

613
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,570
contribute to you than that you can do

614
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,340
pre scans you can do the due diligence

615
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,590
in advance which will bring your costs

616
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,270
down and it's something that you want to

617
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,860
think about from the prototyping phase

618
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:39,059
so check your bill of materials and one

619
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,919
easy way to get there less it's with

620
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,500
like for less money is to just make sure

621
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,020
that you're using as many off-the-shelf

622
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,210
or already pre certified components that

623
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,040
you can in your designs that will help

624
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,080
that's not like a sure thing but it's a

625
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,110
good hack and then also pre scan to find

626
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,000
the worst cases depending on where you

627
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,980
plan to ship so one of the things that

628
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,480
we were talking about at the bar is that

629
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,540
go worldwide and your pre scan testing

630
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,130
and find out where it's going to fail

631
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,160
against what standard we're not just FCC

632
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,490
but CEP SC KCC depending on where you

633
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,059
intend to ship your product so those are

634
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,570
my hacks pre-scan means that you can

635
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,910
book time at a laboratory like a

636
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,880
national regulated testing laboratory

637
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,049
for half the amount of time from less

638
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,500
money and just say show me where I'm

639
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,990
gonna fail against the standards that

640
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,299
exist right now for this class of

641
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,030
product that I want to get through

642
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,830
certification and they'll just go

643
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,230
straight to the crazy parts and say okay

644
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,880
you're gonna fail here here here here

645
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,530
and you can address that in your design

646
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,730
go back for the full battery of tests it

647
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,350
cost a little bit more but you're it

648
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,830
it's better than paying twice full rate

649
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,380
to fail the first time figure it out and

650
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,450
then pay it again for one of the joys

651
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,490
with the products which are sale they

652
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,580
are they are fairly fairly low volume

653
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,740
but also because I'll supply the biz as

654
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,700
a kit of parts the the fact that it's

655
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,340
the use of assembles it so things like

656
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,799
FCC tested you're going to get different

657
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,900
results from different people because

658
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,280
they've got longer legs sort of

659
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,309
resistors or extra solder less old or

660
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,950
whatever so so so with that my products

661
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,080
they they could actually be FCC tested

662
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,690
for things like that so I think I do

663
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,150
sleep below the radar there I hope so

664
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,179
anyway

665
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,240
