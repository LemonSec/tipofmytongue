1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,859
well hello again our next speaker is a

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,470
creative technologist who specializes in

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,719
music technologies craft based

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,420
electronics and education she is known

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,549
for inventing the mini mute DIY

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,949
children's gesture controlled instrument

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,439
and as the author of the crafty kid's

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,470
guide to DIY electronics her talk today

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,720
will showcase making and hackings

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,760
influence on music throughout history

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,010
and she'll also take a look at some of

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,080
her projects with artists in London in

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,660
Berlin please welcome to the hackaday

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:46,968
super conference stage Helen Lee hello

15
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm a general-purpose art tech weirdo

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,379
and I'm going to talk to you today about

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,870
the history of hacking in music

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,060
technology and have a small group of

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
strange people and played with

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,170
technology and change the face of

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,140
mainstream audio production I'm also

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,369
going to take you through some of my

23
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,159
projects as a way to illustrate some of

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,810
the cool things that coming out of the

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,850
music technology hacking scenes in

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,439
London and Berlin

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,810
so before I start that I'm gonna tell

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,810
you a little bit about myself I am

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,850
broadly speaking a creative technologist

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,680
which means that I like hacking on

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,900
things and I also like making art and I

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,640
like smashing the two together as much

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,610
as humanly possible my main form of art

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,270
that I do is music an experimental

35
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,790
instrument design and my main form of

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,590
technology that I like is electronics

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,619
and hardware and that's why I'm here um

38
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,799
so I make experimental instruments and

39
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,680
hardware interviews interfaces for music

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,430
and this is one of my sculptures so I

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,420
make sonic circuit sculptures using a

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,560
variety of unusual materials um I was

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,690
I'll tell you about this project a

44
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,920
little bit later on and we'll hear it as

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,620
well this is actually a subwoofer bass

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,520
which I hope will play and as well as

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,739
doing and this is made of brass as well

48
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,200
and I make a lot of things with soft

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,910
circuits as well my problem of those

50
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,989
with me um now surprisingly I don't make

51
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,790
my living making experimental science

52
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,530
sculptures that's not something you

53
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,290
generally pay your rent with but I do

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,430
and I do manage to put my work from my

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,319
experimental music into you the stuff

56
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,780
let get paid to do as well so this is

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,640
one of the things I do I do

58
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,540
product design it's and educational

59
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,780
experience design this is I was the lead

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,170
developer on this kit and which is sold

61
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,879
by Adafruit and Micro Center and blah

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,310
blah blah and I developed it with Imogen

63
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,519
Heap

64
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,040
and P Maroney who are like the British

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,890
Adafruit I guess um and this is my hand

66
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,239
on the box also hand model they

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,739
photoshopped my hand I think I've got

68
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,280
really wonky hands and so I make

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,080
products I've done some stuff on

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,540
Kickstarter and products and you know

71
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,690
mainstream things and blah blah blah and

72
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,310
this is an educational product it is an

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,140
instrument but it is an instrument that

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,030
is designed to teach children how to

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,260
code education is extremely important to

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,349
me so it's one of the themes throughout

77
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,349
my work as well as music technology this

78
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,670
is a still from my book I make I'm

79
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,319
really interested in alternative

80
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,390
materials in electronics and one of the

81
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,620
things I really like to do is take

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,709
traditional craft materials and see how

83
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,409
I can make I can make inventions through

84
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,689
them and the the the thing that really

85
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,580
interested me and is electronic

86
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,049
embroidery and using squishy circuits

87
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,670
essentially I think it's kind of really

88
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,540
interesting and tactile so yeah that's a

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,610
brief introduction to me writing product

90
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,239
stuff we had art with music and so on

91
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,839
words to the talk

92
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,930
so this is the signal that the talk has

93
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,548
started because it's a very pretentious

94
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,440
quote by a very pretentious man called

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,930
John Cage God rest his soul

96
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,389
he's a probably most famous for his

97
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,870
silent composition 433 when nobody plays

98
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,669
anything and the audience is just like

99
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,480
Jesus Christ or any so someone's

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,000
discharged his work as more interesting

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
to think about than to actually listen

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
to which I can attest to being

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,750
absolutely the correct case but he was

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,930
also a hardware hacker and so which not

105
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,780
many people know about him he's probably

106
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,520
one of the more famous people in

107
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,830
experimental music but there has always

108
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,229
been experimental music and the reason I

109
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,180
put this quote up there is remind you

110
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,479
that all music is invented and so are

111
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,660
all instruments and so is all music and

112
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,880
so something that might be experimental

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,530
today might be mainstream in ten years

114
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,350
time people like who would think of as

115
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,020
classical music mainstays as Debussy

116
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,729
Streisand Stravinsky they were all

117
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,100
considered album guard and controversial

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,890
in their time a violin wasn't a violin

119
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,320
until actually very recently and it took

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,560
ten centuries of iteration and for the

121
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,180
violin to look like and look and sound

122
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,950
like it does today which anyone

123
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,600
standards is a pretty long product

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,020
development cycle um and even the note a

125
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,620
the middle a is 440 Hertz right okay we

126
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,120
all know that but did you know that it

127
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,180
actually wasn't 440 Hertz until 1953

128
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,280
when a group of dudes sat down in a room

129
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,400
and signed an international Accord

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,080
previous to that a French violin sr a

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,340
French flute would sound very different

132
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,360
to an Italian flute and and actually one

133
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,190
of my favorite conspiracy theories I'm

134
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,139
big a big lover of ridiculous conspiracy

135
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,729
theories but there is a there is an

136
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,680
ongoing conspiracy theory that the

137
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,720
reason 440 Hertz was chosen was a Nazi

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,520
mind-control experiment as population

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
control and there are websites now where

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
you can upload your music which is if

141
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,210
4/4 hurts you hurt and it will pitch

142
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,950
change it to be F or a 2 B 3 4 3 2 4 3 2

143
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,970
is the most common one but there are

144
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,979
competing ones as four three eight and

145
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,129
there's even some

146
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,029
madmen who think that a should be 532

147
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,429
something anyway if you enjoy expect

148
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:35,899
your conspiracy theories like I do it's

149
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,339
a it's a funny rabbit hole to go down

150
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,019
but yeah so basic my point really is

151
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,719
that music is made up you know it's is

152
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,449
an experiment it's an experiment and as

153
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,369
old as human history but this is the

154
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:53,959
story of how people took a piece of

155
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:58,550
technology and get it to change things

156
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,659
and so the this is a magnetic

157
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,339
reel-to-reel tape recorder which was

158
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,779
invented kind of in the 1920s it was it

159
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,339
made lots of leaps in the 1940s the

160
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,469
Nazis used it to to do to edit

161
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,349
propaganda so previously to this bad boy

162
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,839
and we were all old broadcasts were

163
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,679
either live or they were photographs

164
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,499
right so you can't edit a phonograph and

165
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,269
you can't edit a live recording this was

166
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,709
the first time you could actually edit

167
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,269
something and the way that you do that

168
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,860
and this is the technology that the

169
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,499
Nazis developed for their propaganda was

170
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,089
you would record it onto the magnetic

171
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,759
tape okay great folk excellent and you

172
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,529
could then chop the pieces out with a

173
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,389
scalpel and stick it back together with

174
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,949
sticky tape so it's a very physical

175
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:51,919
process so they kept that under their

176
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,369
belts

177
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,019
we didn't nobody else apart from the

178
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,610
Nazis had this technology until after

179
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,759
World War two this advanced technology

180
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,909
and after World War two it exploded

181
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,889
everywhere it was like oh my gosh we can

182
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,659
edit things this is very exciting

183
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,550
so they started editing things with this

184
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,369
and they would and this became like the

185
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,379
predominant broadcast technique

186
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,999
reel-to-reel now in the 1940s a group of

187
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,279
an a small group of recording artists in

188
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,569
Paris has had access to one of these and

189
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,240
and they started to think how can we

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,819
muck around with this as you know humans

191
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,499
love to muck around with technology so

192
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,479
they took this and instead of just

193
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,969
editing normal text or sorry normal

194
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,568
speech or normal music they decided they

195
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,429
feel what happens if we switch it around

196
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,289
what happens if we

197
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,210
speed it up and slow it down what

198
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,070
happens if we mess with it and all these

199
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,170
different ways and this is a group of

200
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,090
people called the music concrete and

201
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,910
we've got stuck Eisen and Schaffer are

202
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,200
probably the most famous ones but it was

203
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,790
actually a small group of music tech

204
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,100
hackers who got together and made these

205
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,500
god-awful recordings which you can still

206
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,940
hear on youtube today this sounds

207
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,450
terrible

208
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,210
but it's not about the same that they

209
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,620
made it was the techniques that they

210
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,660
developed during the creation of that

211
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,290
sound which had a huge impact on the

212
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,730
whole of music production um so let's

213
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,930
have a look at this this is one in in in

214
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,240
action before so there's two things you

215
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
need to understand by music by a sound

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,900
and is that it has a attack which is how

217
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,820
quickly it starts and then and then a

218
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,370
decay which is how how much it drops off

219
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,740
okay so think about a violin again if

220
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,710
you pluck a violin string and it what

221
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,960
the central starts immediately and then

222
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,370
it will resonate and depending on the

223
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,260
room its in or depending on the body of

224
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,300
the violin it will fade away over a

225
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,560
certain amount of time right just like

226
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,870
and then it fades away so that's the

227
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,420
attack and the decay now these

228
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,610
experiment is to slightly discovered

229
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,440
that if you turn the tape around you

230
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,410
switched it around this same sound could

231
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,410
have a long attack so it would start off

232
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,020
really quiet and then warm and then stop

233
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,120
very very quickly now this sound is very

234
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
hard to achieve in nature so we were

235
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,320
able to then by recording different

236
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
things switching them round speeding

237
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,820
them up which changes the pitch up

238
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,710
slowing them down which slows the pitch

239
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,680
down they were able to create entirely

240
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,050
new signs that are not found in nature

241
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,970
um so these these I'll play this you can

242
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,180
see it happening it's a very short hear

243
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,630
great there's no sound

244
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,960
thank you and so this is them I'll just

245
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,070
do that again

246
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,779
[Music]

247
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,430
this is what they decided this is what

248
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,250
they were creating and these techniques

249
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,810
led to looping which is when you loop

250
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,040
something I mean here you go we know

251
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,950
lies it lets a sampling it lets the idea

252
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,899
of fine science so these were portable

253
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,850
so you could actually go around and

254
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,970
record things innate in nature wasn't

255
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,070
just studio accounting and because of

256
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,610
this composite science distortion gained

257
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,250
all of these techniques that we take for

258
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,230
granted now were actually invented by a

259
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,029
small group of music tech occurs in

260
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,390
Paris in the 1940s and as I say the

261
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,010
music was awful but their impact was

262
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,860
absolutely huge and this was generally

263
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,350
it took about 20 years for if to filter

264
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,570
through into the mainstream and this was

265
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,760
probably the big the foot bud I know it

266
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,740
was it was the first big tract that used

267
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,980
these monk music concrete techniques now

268
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,540
remember when you listen to this well

269
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,550
I'm going to stop playing it we aren't

270
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,050
us enough of that great tract thing um

271
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,230
so some weirdo hackers changed rock and

272
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,560
roll production forever awesome but one

273
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,350
of my favorite things about culture is

274
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,420
not necessarily what one group of

275
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,980
hackers does but what the ripple effect

276
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,310
of that technology is you know you don't

277
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,300
know when you create something

278
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,709
especially when you open saw something

279
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,300
and share something like we do in our

280
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,279
community you have no idea what kind of

281
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,320
impact it will have on other people what

282
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,670
little nuggets of information they'll

283
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,709
pick up and run with so I thought it'd

284
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,450
be kind of fun to talk about it their

285
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,700
influence on somebody else who's also

286
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,040
incredibly influential do I know who

287
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,050
this is

288
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,360
no well you should do she's called

289
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,940
Daphne Orem and she's a founder of the

290
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,709
BBC radio phonic workshop which is an

291
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,440
iconic sign design it was one of the

292
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,949
birthplaces of Foley art it was one of

293
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:35,180
the birthplaces of electronic music and

294
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,860
hugely hugely influential but she's

295
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,300
largely lost her history which is very

296
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,310
sad to me and so she's a trained

297
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,290
musician this is Daphne Daphne she's a

298
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,060
working-class last from from the north

299
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,269
of England and she she's a trained

300
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,399
musician with an interest in electronics

301
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
and physics

302
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,410
and in the 1940s as a woman you didn't

303
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,210
often get to do very interesting jobs

304
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,700
and but she managed to get a job at the

305
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,400
BBC queuing up reel-to-reel tape

306
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,440
recording and she went on a training

307
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
course when she went to a conference

308
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,640
actually much like this but in black and

309
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,070
white and she went to a conference in

310
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,650
Paris where she met the the finders of

311
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,930
music concrete and they blew her mind

312
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,430
she's like I wanna go home and play with

313
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,810
it and she saw this huge huge potential

314
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,460
for it so she went back to the BBC and

315
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,010
she's like guys guys I've just seen this

316
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,290
really cool thing like can we can we do

317
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,630
some of this like no go back to your

318
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,520
studio so she did she went back to a

319
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,220
studio but after work she would steal

320
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,310
the keys of a recording studio and she'd

321
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,410
run around the BBC and collect equipment

322
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,500
and experiment with things and she would

323
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,760
do this for seven years until she

324
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,720
finally convinced somebody to let her do

325
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,450
the same track to I think it was a

326
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,410
sci-fi sci-fi track and so she she did

327
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,110
this sci-fi track sign track and it went

328
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,000
it went live and they blew everybody's

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,260
minds because it was these signs that

330
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,910
nobody had ever heard before they were

331
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,010
like what is this it's not a violin you

332
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,920
know and and it was it proved and

333
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,210
obviously popular she got asked to do

334
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,410
more and more and more and then

335
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,660
something unprecedented happened for the

336
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,000
1950's this is the early 1950s as well

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,390
she got given her own studio which is

338
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,190
the BBC radio phonic workshop and she

339
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,020
got given a team to work on this same

340
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,670
designer to work on these experimental

341
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,700
science for incidental music or insane

342
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,340
tracks or so on and then she left saying

343
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,770
they wanted my work they wanted my ideas

344
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,840
but they didn't want me so she trained

345
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,180
up a bunch of man and was excluded from

346
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,730
her from her life's work largely which

347
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,270
was pretty sad but you know she went on

348
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,980
to do cool things she's and she's got an

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,900
amazing invention in the Science Museum

350
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,400
in London called the over a mix machine

351
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,410
she went on to create these wild

352
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,660
avant-garde synthesizers at her own art

353
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,959
studio so even though she wasn't able to

354
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,379
keep hold of her creation at the BBC and

355
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,079
she was able to have a profound lasting

356
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,699
impact and go on to make some really

357
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,309
interesting art as well so we're not

358
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,230
gonna go and see her synthesizer but

359
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,639
what we are going to do is continue

360
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,709
looking at the BBC Radio phonic workshop

361
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,040
with someone else who is also extremely

362
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,709
iconic who Daphne and left the door open

363
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,249
for this is Delia Derbyshire do you know

364
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,499
who Delia Derbyshire is yes there's like

365
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,389
a couple of people she's more famous

366
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,459
actually the reason we know about Daphne

367
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,309
orem is because of music tech nerds

368
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,220
who've gone backwards in time from Delia

369
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,420
Derbyshire I'm Delia Derbyshire was the

370
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,699
arranger and composer of this so let's

371
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,800
see if it plays all right well this is

372
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,929
playing which I think it should be

373
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,399
playing No

374
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,889
why did it not play it takes a while to

375
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,629
come in anyway so the Doctor Who theme

376
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,259
zoom was recorded in 1963 in 1963 there

377
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:16,279
were no synthesizers good there are no

378
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:24,470
instruments not really are created with

379
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,430
signal generators she had a bank

380
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,400
signal generators are used for teaching

381
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,780
electronic litter for testing electronic

382
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,790
circuits and they produced a sine wave

383
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,040
of square wave what you do is record

384
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,980
them the head shifted up pass it through

385
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,330
something that she'd made call their

386
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,660
population and do different white noise

387
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,000
filters on it every single note on this

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,460
has been curtailed and solar tapes

389
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,570
together which is very painstaking and

390
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,210
very very impressive she was an absolute

391
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,990
visionary very very influential then

392
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,790
this there's a wonderful documentary

393
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,340
about her just effort that was made for

394
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,740
Delia Derbyshire day so yeah we are

395
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,050
doctor here we love this and she's also

396
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,849
like something she was also very less a

397
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,890
pharaoh motor Oh another cool thing is

398
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,510
they didn't have multitrack recorders

399
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,000
like that either so they're all the

400
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,740
different tracks that you're hearing was

401
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,569
literally just people around a room on

402
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,520
different tracks and they like three to

403
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,530
one and then they all crash their track

404
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,540
together so it was absolutely and then

405
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,160
they had to be recorded the so it's like

406
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,040
absolutely bonkers and she was asked

407
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:36,070
about the process and response was just

408
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,890
a which is largely how I talk about all

409
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,310
of my technology not sure how ever

410
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,770
I know works so yeah Delia Derbyshire we

411
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,380
like her we love her oh this is a this

412
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,880
is something that's actually is fairly

413
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,950
unrelated but this is a track that she

414
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,270
composed I want to put it in here

415
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:35,080
because again we classic track name I'm

416
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,420
gonna leave the review phonic workshop

417
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,590
there but I wanted to and for this

418
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,450
segment of my talk on this quote

419
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,790
I'm sorry BBC Radio phonic workshop

420
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,710
engineer I forgot his name I think it

421
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,020
might be Mike s but I can't remember who

422
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,600
said this to me and but and this is just

423
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,450
a really nice quote which is really and

424
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,720
some music hacking is like none of us

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,670
know what we're doing and that's okay

426
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,070
and you know the important the there's

427
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,720
an importance of allowing for outsider

428
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
influence on mainstream technology and

429
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,920
there's an important it's important to

430
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,560
remember that all music is made up none

431
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
of us really know what we're doing and

432
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,050
that's kind of okay and you know great

433
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,330
creativity you can come from great

434
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,620
ignorant knowledge so it's I think

435
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,330
experimentation is very very important

436
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,330
and created technology so BBC Radio

437
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,770
phonic workshop what a golden age for

438
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,770
music tech hacking and I think that now

439
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,990
also is a golden age for music tech

440
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,850
hacking for kind of the same reasons

441
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,580
there was a small dedicated community

442
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,690
that would just share their knowledge

443
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,970
with each other and which led to great

444
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,710
leaps forward and there was new

445
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,260
available cheap technology and the same

446
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,510
situation is true today we have an

447
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,130
incredible community at our fingertips

448
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,320
nowadays and we also have lots and lots

449
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,430
of really cool cheap technology and

450
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,280
excitingly people like us here we're

451
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,230
also accessible I've met so many people

452
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,970
on the internet that we've that I've

453
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,230
shared music tech stuff with and I think

454
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,590
that's the key point really places like

455
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,630
this this is a hacker space that I used

456
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,010
to belong to in London which had a big

457
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,810
music focus this is actually a musical

458
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,210
instrument here and makerspaces

459
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,090
hackerspaces community is super

460
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,390
important the sharing and the influence

461
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,450
cannot be understated I think we often

462
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,810
think about it

463
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,450
about great inventions and great leaps

464
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,310
forward in technology or great leaps

465
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,370
forward in art or something that is

466
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,540
driven forward by a small number of

467
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,090
people or some kind of lone genius but

468
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,220
that's an absolute myth you know even

469
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,630
Picasso wouldn't have been Picasso

470
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,610
without Georges Braque or Henri Matisse

471
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,450
you know it's it's a community effort

472
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,280
and we all push each other forward by

473
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,320
sharing so make spaces the other thing

474
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
that's really cool actually and is is

475
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,660
the music tech community in in in in in

476
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,200
words my god the music tech community

477
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,060
share a lot on YouTube so there's this

478
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,060
is a guy called Sam he's got a YouTube

479
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,680
channel called like my new computer and

480
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,560
this is his Furby organ which is as

481
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,560
horrific as it sounds so if you wanna

482
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,700
have nightmares you should definitely

483
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,940
look that up but as well as playing his

484
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,230
creations

485
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,230
he shares tie-downs of it shows how

486
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,360
they've done it as well so these kind of

487
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,980
and Sam's a great example of somebody

488
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,300
who's very open about their technology

489
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,580
and is very open about sharing and just

490
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,000
really cool things and then the final

491
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,590
thing and that I think one of the

492
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,550
reasons why I think that there's a

493
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,500
renaissance in music tech hacking as

494
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,060
well as the spaces as well as YouTube

495
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,380
and Twitter is is the events events like

496
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,090
this this is a this is a hacker camp in

497
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,190
in in London where and you basically

498
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,870
hack on stuff just like this you know

499
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,200
outside in a field in in in in in the UK

500
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,850
and and the reason I put this

501
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,220
here is because of the technology that I

502
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,900
am wearing here probably cost like $20

503
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,460
20 years ago this was impossible we're

504
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,520
able now to create very very powerful

505
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,440
pieces of technology with very very

506
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,140
little money and so so that's one of the

507
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,760
reasons I think it's all very exciting

508
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
so I'm now gonna show you some of my

509
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,150
project it's as a way to fangirl about

510
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,890
the project they're about the technology

511
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,690
that I used with them and also to talk

512
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,580
about the work of some of the other cool

513
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,500
people in London and Berlin which are

514
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,940
the two major cities I've lived in in

515
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,140
the last you know 10 years also and both

516
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,860
of them have huge music tech communities

517
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,280
so and this is one of my creatures a

518
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,270
fiddle play okay so I make these circuit

519
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,870
sculptures I was inspired by Mohit and

520
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,570
Jerry on their work on circus sculptures

521
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,310
they made these lovely precise small

522
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,250
beautiful things and I went along to a

523
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,730
music tech hack with drew thirsty knee

524
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,100
and my composer friends and Andrew

525
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,720
hockey with the idea of making this

526
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,280
beautiful small precise object my

527
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,160
sculptures also this big wavy mess this

528
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,460
is inspired by a Welsh harp and it uses

529
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,290
capacitive touch and I'll talk about

530
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,850
some of the technologies

531
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,220
that I already like so I love to use

532
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,860
capacitive touch and gesture I've taught

533
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,780
a lot of electronic engineers how to

534
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,580
make instruments but I've also taught a

535
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,140
lot of musicians how to use electronics

536
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,450
and I always find the latter group make

537
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,809
more interesting things because you know

538
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,970
like everyone's here the same square

539
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,900
wave theremin from another tween oh but

540
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,250
actually when you get a group of people

541
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,870
who don't know what they're doing but

542
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,340
actually do you know how to create music

543
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,470
and create good experience they

544
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,270
generally tend to use one of those two

545
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,390
technologies gesture or cap touch it

546
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,070
just happens that's just what they all

547
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,409
use is it it's kind of crazy to me but

548
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,720
really cool and this is another one I

549
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,520
mean this is a this is the sub-base

550
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,470
creature this is so that previous one

551
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,780
was a bit more generative this is more

552
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,450
of a traditional instrument and this is

553
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,100
something I've been developing in

554
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,289
collaboration with there's a bassist

555
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:33,460
called I say Hassan who bassist afford

556
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,190
the savages and he's on two at the

557
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,840
moment doing the base for the Pixies

558
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,789
which is blowing my mind so I'm making

559
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,030
her one of these creatures so it's been

560
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,140
really interesting to work with a

561
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,490
non-technical person who's who wants an

562
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,620
instrument and kind of creating that

563
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,750
with them so I took I went from

564
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,360
experimental to traditional and then I'm

565
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,690
going back again to and some of my other

566
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,760
interest which is soft circuitry I like

567
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,070
to go and pick weird materials I go to

568
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,559
art shops more than electronic shops and

569
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,730
I'll go to an art shop with my

570
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,440
multimeter to check the properties of

571
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,730
the different materials so that's very

572
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,890
inspiring to me and then so and this is

573
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,929
mine so I'm doing some soft circuit

574
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,610
stuff I really am very very interested

575
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,559
in electronic embroidery and I think

576
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,559
it's a textiles or something that's got

577
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,140
huge potential and I've got she got a

578
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,490
new prototype of this I'm making a

579
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,190
human-sized abstract cephalopod there's

580
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,409
things to you when you stroke it it's

581
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,000
also pressure sensitive and proximity

582
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,190
sensing and the pressure sensing thing

583
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,240
was kind of an accident that I

584
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,919
discovered yesterday so but that's kind

585
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,110
of cool but yeah so it's things to you

586
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,640
it's fluffy big

587
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,820
kind of works we'll see and I've got it

588
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,320
over there so if you see me around I can

589
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,390
I can make it play something I've just

590
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,890
got one dismembered tentacle at the

591
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,720
moment though so everyone's like is it

592
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,950
tail me no all right and then this is a

593
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,600
jumping-off point so this is another

594
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,610
project engine and so this is a flexible

595
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,530
PCB it's the second PCB I've ever

596
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,230
designed really great love it fun fun

597
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,420
fun and but this is going to be a

598
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,730
vocoder so I can play it by touching my

599
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,610
throat and it uses as do the creatures

600
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,310
this here this Isabella and this is a

601
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,980
cap touch board so the capacitive touch

602
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,840
let me just move on yes so basically

603
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,260
capacitive touch is really annoying to

604
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,780
work with on the body because it can't

605
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,340
tell the difference between the skin

606
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,530
underneath and your finger on top unless

607
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,960
you've got very sensitive sensors so

608
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,340
I've started using this sensor which is

609
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,560
a trail sensor and they sent me a

610
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,300
prototype of it and I'm completely in

611
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,680
love it's like an MPR when she went

612
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,590
except it's got a different chip it's

613
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,380
got 30 pins and it's way more sensitive

614
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,850
so I'm actually able to make working

615
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,400
wearable cat touch instruments which is

616
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,380
kind of cool so yeah that's it

617
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,060
this is them and they plugged into this

618
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,220
this is actually a Cape before a beagle

619
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,260
board and on the underneath of this is a

620
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,880
pocket people so it's like this big and

621
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,180
this is now my my weapon of choice for

622
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,280
making a bed at instruments and it's

623
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,830
super fast it's super small and the

624
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,270
killer app for me is that you can use

625
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,310
established music technology so and when

626
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,700
when you're creating a sound and most of

627
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,460
the you know unless you're a C++ whiz

628
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,380
you're going to be stuck with using

629
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,350
other people's libraries and so on but

630
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,840
this is something that musicians use

631
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,300
called pure data and this is an open

632
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,100
source piece of software that is visual

633
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,020
block based coding that allows you to

634
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,420
create very very complicated science

635
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,100
synthesis and the cool thing about the

636
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,080
Bela is you can just save your pure data

637
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,960
patch on to the Bela and it will auto

638
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,790
play which is an absolute for me it's

639
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,250
like an absolute game changer in terms

640
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,440
of the complexity of embedded

641
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,930
instruments so yeah total total pure

642
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,780
data and bela fangirl and the other

643
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,309
thing i really like to use

644
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,419
I'm gonna tell you about one more

645
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,289
project um is the micro Burt and I like

646
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:05,149
using it because it's really it's a

647
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,029
children's microcontroller and it's like

648
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,219
$15 and it doesn't really do that much

649
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,229
but what it does it does really well and

650
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,809
I find it kind of funny to use something

651
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,429
really really cheap and really really

652
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,529
simple to make really complex things so

653
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,779
yeah this is one of my products it uses

654
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,519
gesture control it makes bleep loopy

655
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,139
music this is a like a so Apple speaker

656
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:30,080
and and I was like this is cool this is

657
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,339
cool you know it's just kind of nice I

658
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,139
mean it was it was a it was a riff on

659
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,989
this so this is the me Moog love this is

660
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,839
a developed by a team in London of which

661
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,369
I am apart and is a professional quality

662
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:45,169
Wireless gesture control device and that

663
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,179
allows you to interact with able to earn

664
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,039
or supercollider any kind of like

665
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,950
professional music technology without

666
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,820
interfacing with a laptop this is

667
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,529
essentially a very very fancy MIDI

668
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,419
controller let's put it that way it's

669
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,519
been used on ariana grande's tour and

670
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,080
blah blah blah and I saw it I was like

671
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,169
if I could make a kid's version of this

672
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:04,789
11 year old girls would lose their mind

673
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,820
and I was right so I made a kid's

674
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,039
version of this with an advisory board

675
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,799
of 50 girls these are this is the

676
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,259
prototyping thing and yada yada yada

677
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:18,589
everybody likes it and but I wanted to

678
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,029
tell you about it is because I was like

679
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,799
well okay that's cool it makes bleeps

680
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,330
and bloops and make square waves yeah

681
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,669
yeah yeah we all like chiptune music but

682
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,080
I wanted to go further with the chiptune

683
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,519
and I was really interested to see if we

684
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,779
could do that with with this cheap

685
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:35,690
microcontroller can I make a expensive

686
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,729
MIDI instrument with a 10 dock with us

687
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:41,389
$15 microcontroller and first of all I

688
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:44,570
started off with this and this is a

689
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,549
gesture controlled robot unicorn I had a

690
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,549
herd of them I worked with a man artist

691
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,219
called we know who made me who made me a

692
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:54,259
very evil looking glyph to control my

693
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,599
robots worth this was kind of at the

694
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,919
same time as I was developing the glove

695
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,710
and then I met this last and this is

696
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,869
Martine Nikola Regina she's an artist

697
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,489
and her literacies known as the moon

698
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:05,820
girl and

699
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,360
she is she's an artist who works with an

700
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,980
astronomy facility and I think the

701
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,470
Netherlands and she bounces Cylons off

702
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,270
of the Moon and then records them when

703
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,650
they come back so you get these

704
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,920
wonderful distortion effects say it's

705
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,990
called the moon bouncing and so I took

706
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,970
some she bounced the signs of a cello

707
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,580
off of the moon and re-recorded it and I

708
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,330
took that those signs of a cello and and

709
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,970
and then I was able to gesture control

710
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,340
it was like a gesture controlled moon

711
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,590
cello sampler and that was it was like

712
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,570
$20 worth of materials and it worked

713
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,280
perfectly and all of the code for that

714
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,990
is and all of the instructions for that

715
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,170
on my github which is a hot mess but

716
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,330
there are student good stuff on it yeah

717
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,620
so that was that was really cool and

718
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,120
then I actually taught this woman how to

719
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,010
use it especially she's a really cool

720
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,100
musician and here she is with my

721
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,350
children's glove looping

722
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,430
like 15 bucks

723
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:16,970
all right yeah she's very talented Thank

724
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,570
You Betty my point really is through

725
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,660
working with several different artists

726
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,920
and several different people from

727
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,530
different disciplines not just not just

728
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,750
technologists but musicians artists all

729
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,190
sorts of different people you're able to

730
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,830
get something that is like much much

731
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,530
greater than the sum of the parts and by

732
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,120
sharing all of this technology were able

733
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,360
to create this kind of community where

734
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,730
we've given artists a chance to use

735
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,250
15-dollar technology to create something

736
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,630
that would not have been previously

737
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,310
possible this is something that would

738
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,900
normally cost thousands and thousands of

739
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,490
dollars but by building on each other's

740
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,770
work and by sharing our work in our

741
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,750
community and were able to do something

742
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,620
pretty cool so that's my time I've done

743
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,360
30 minutes that's the end

744
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,950
I hope I'm leaving you with the idea

745
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,440
that you don't need expensive equipment

746
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,120
to make cool things in music

747
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,790
technologies and you also don't need to

748
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,800
be an expert musician or an expert

749
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,020
engineer like I'm a fairly crappy

750
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,910
musician and a fairly crappy engineer

751
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,410
but together pushing smashing those two

752
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,940
things together and like making them

753
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,790
kiss like I'm able to create some really

754
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,210
cool things um so you know just get

755
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,100
involved and move beyond chiptune please

756
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,450
and so yeah act upon it make some noise

757
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,539
[Applause]
