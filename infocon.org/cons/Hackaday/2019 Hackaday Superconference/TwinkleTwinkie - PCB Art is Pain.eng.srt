2
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,220
welcome back our next speaker has quite

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,620
an eye for making art out of PCB designs

4
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,710
he has a wide array of add-ons and even

5
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,239
full-blown badges that are out there on

6
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,850
the internet and even in his tindy store

7
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,410
he's here to talk to us about how even

8
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,519
when you think you've done absolutely

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,640
everything right PCB fabrication can

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,710
still go awry please welcome to the hack

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,900
at a super conference stage twinkle

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,680
twinkle

[Applause]

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,729
hello I'm Dingle Twiggy this is my talk

15
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,979
PCB art is pain so Who am I I make this

16
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,479
stuff I really like to make take PCBs

17
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,910
and use them as a unusual medium to make

18
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,729
interesting things inside jokes annoying

19
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,759
things that sting baby shark songs and

20
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,119
demos and art badge this talk is

21
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,209
primarily about art badge and about how

22
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,670
it almost completely fell apart because

23
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,830
I asked the fab to do something that

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,509
turned out very bad so this is Ark badge

25
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,539
is made up of basically two main three

26
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,700
main parts you get the top you've got a

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,709
spacer you got the bottom the bottom is

28
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,390
doing all the good stuff it's got all

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,100
the hardware on it the top is a purely

30
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,020
art board to give you that nice effect

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,209
and everything like that but it only

32
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,880
works if the LEDs can completely shine

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,660
through correctly so here's the specs

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,000
for the top board it was made of ever

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,900
for the original prototype was and one

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,730
point six millimeters thick and I had it

37
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,940
with red solder mask black silk heels

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,670
produce my PCB way I'm black so part is

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,930
actually what really got me in trouble

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,099
so this is what the prototype looked

41
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,920
like I didn't ask them to do black silk

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,630
as PCB no it doesn't normally do black

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,849
silk so for her to type I just need to

44
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,290
make sure that my art looked good and

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,959
everything functioned fine and it just

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,069
said prototype because I need to fill

47
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,480
the space and get them to stop asking

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,710
any questions about is this what the

49
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,090
whole screen or not

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,450
this is actually was supposed to be the

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,520
final on the right you have the bottom

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,590
board and it was final it was perfect

53
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,450
and I thought a table board was perfect

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,099
and as you can see it has this like

55
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,599
really nice black silk screen and I

56
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,819
asked them to do a black silk screen

57
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,910
because I really wanted it to just look

58
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,069
something a little different and some of

59
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,239
the fans I don't really like how they do

60
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,190
read it sometimes it comes out a little

61
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,720
orange but PCV ways red was actually

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
really great but he don't do black but

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,830
I've done this board with them I got

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,690
them to do it after fighting with him

65
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,239
for a week and then they're like okay

66
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,280
we'll do it but we have to send it to

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,519
our advanced production fab and I was

68
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,890
like sure whatever but that actually

69
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,959
took two and a half weeks to make no

70
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,580
real big deal had plenty of time to get

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,260
it done but as you can see this bottom

72
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,299
board looks a little different so on the

73
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,829
left here is a completed badge with the

74
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,920
prototype board on the right is with the

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,260
final board now you might not it might

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,510
not be too obvious but the contrast in

77
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,470
person is very very steep and extremely

78
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,420
dim actually my camera is kind of

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,700
blowing up how bright it is and a big

80
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,910
part of the importance of this badge was

81
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,350
that you'd be able to if you want to put

82
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,209
it under your shirt to have a neat Tony

83
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,520
Stark look-alike thing and that does not

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,850
work right but if you look at the spacer

85
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,340
here you can see the LEDs are the right

86
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,590
color it's just that the light is

87
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,090
diffusing in correctly it's the wrong

88
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,479
color

89
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,720
and when you look at them side-by-side

90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
it starts to become a little more

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,770
obvious you can see the pattern at the

92
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,320
top on the prototype and you can't see

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,360
it here it means the but it means the

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,580
for-4 material they used was a different

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,919
kind of material we speculate that they

96
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,810
use the higher quality material so

97
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,850
technically speaking they did nothing

98
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,889
wrong this is a technically perfect

99
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,590
board but for my artistic use it's

100
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,849
completely useless so I had to figure

101
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,729
out what to do because I had literally

102
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,350
already assembled two

103
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,560
50 boards but I didn't have top for them

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,260
so I decided to go ahead and just

105
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,860
reorder them in with the original white

106
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,140
but to just make sure for sure that I

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,930
had them do it in half and these

108
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,520
pictures kind of show a little bit

109
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,930
different so you can see how damn it is

110
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,520
if you look on the right hub right the

111
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,590
blue is and so this is a very bad and it

112
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,510
completely washed out the colors so the

113
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,120
actual final board ended up being white

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,180
silk screen and half the thickness I

115
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,580
have to thickness because even if they

116
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,320
decided no we're just gonna keep using

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,470
this other material without telling you

118
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,550
by cutting the thickness and 1/2 it

119
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,740
shouldn't matter there was less for for

120
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,060
the light to diffuse so here is the

121
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,180
actual final it looks basically

122
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,400
identical but as you can see on the

123
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
right here you can see way more of a

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
copper through the bottom and that's

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
actually really important because I

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,490
wasn't trying to diffuse the light as

127
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm like spreading it out the distance

128
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,570
from the top board in the bottom board

129
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,490
was gonna do that for me but by making

130
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,230
it so thin the light shows through more

131
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,690
accurately color wise and it's really

132
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,980
really important for this because the

133
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,050
whole purpose of this badge which is on

134
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,910
my chest right now is it has to look

135
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,980
cool and if it looks dim and ugly like

136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,000
the batteries are dying all the time

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,360
that doesn't look cool that looks lazy

138
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,250
and people had already seen the part of

139
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,510
site they knew what the color should be

140
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,270
so and I didn't want to misrepresent my

141
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,090
project so I had it remade gone in half

142
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,720
and then I had 250 coasters to give out

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,080
after that and here you can see them

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,850
side by side and that's where the

145
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,500
contrast like the difference between

146
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,440
them becomes really really obvious and

147
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,500
that's something that I've made

148
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,640
literally over three different board

149
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,250
designs I've never seen this before

150
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,920
and I've ordered from this fab dozens of

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,100
times and I've never seen that before so

152
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,290
like I said technically speaking either

153
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,540
one of us did anything wrong but if I

154
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,840
had gone ahead and ignored that and sent

155
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,360
it on to people who were buying my badge

156
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,490
I would have immediately gotten feedback

157
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,240
like why

158
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,940
as bright is the LEDs bad I don't know

159
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,380
and then I would just like kill

160
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,990
confidence in me and to my peers and the

161
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,970
other batch making community I it's just

162
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,819
an average remove and I mean it's not

163
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,800
that expensive to just say scurried

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
things aren't right redo it correctly do

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,569
the job right because no one's gonna

166
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,319
remember the up excuse me

167
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,849
remember how cool it is on the final

168
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,740
product and also because if you are so

169
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,810
then every once in a while when I

170
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,919
replace the thought boards I

171
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,370
accidentally put two on there because

172
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,139
someone actually did reach out to me and

173
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,759
said my board doesn't look quite right

174
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,319
but it came with an extra top am I

175
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,699
supposed to swap them myself and I was

176
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,560
like no I shouldn't to me a picture and

177
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,419
they say no like that's not right I

178
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,860
think did you take this first off and

179
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,509
like just like see if there's more parts

180
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,190
and that's what he sent me back and I

181
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,139
was like oh sweet well enjoy the extra

182
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,880
coaster well I'm probably a little head

183
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,759

184
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,800
