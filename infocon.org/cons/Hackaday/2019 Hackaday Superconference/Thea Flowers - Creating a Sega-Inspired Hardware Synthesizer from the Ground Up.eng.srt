1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
some bloops part of the super conference

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,810
so our next speaker is an open-source

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,569
advocate software engineer and maker and

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,700
while she spent most of her time with

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,190
the Python community the last year like

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,380
many of us she's been learning to design

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,139
and create synthesizers so her talk

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,449
today showcases a project where she the

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,270
goal was to build a Sega inspired

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,220
Hardware synthesizer from the ground up

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,220
so please ash is already here welcome to

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,169
the super conference stage the flowers

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,750
hi awesome okay a big shout out to the

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,090
super Concord for making this work cuz I

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,620
have a lot of stuff up here if y'all

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,239
haven't noticed and they've been very

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,879
accommodating and understanding where

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:48,780
they should probably be a little

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,960
frustrated so thank you okay good good

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,370
there's a little frustration and it

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,239
keeps us going

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,879
so yeah I'm Thea flowers and I'm here to

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,400
talk to you about a really fun project I

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,500
think it's fun then I've been working on

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,740
over the last year or so I'm gonna talk

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,010
about building a Sega inspired Hardware

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,009
synthesizer from the ground out this was

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,520
my first real hardware project so that

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,689
was dumb in retrospect I encountered a

30
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,189
lot of really interesting challenges

31
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,090
along the way

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,610
and I'm gonna share with you like those

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,020
challenges but I'm also going to talk a

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,430
little bit about what makes that Sega

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,189
Genesis sound so special that inspired

36
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,700
me to create a synthesizer out of it

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,680
with any luck at the end of this fingers

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,030
crossed I'm gonna give you a little demo

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,899
of what it sounds like

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,579
so hopefully this all works what my goal

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,750
here isn't to teach you everything it

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,369
takes to build the sizer like this it

43
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,659
took me the greater part of a year and

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,560
we have 30 minutes here today so yeah

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,049
don't don't think you'll walk away from

46
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,460
this knowing how to build all of this

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,850
but everything that I did as part of

48
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,229
this project is open source so if you

49
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,850
want to go and learn from my mistakes by

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,959
all means please do that cool so let's

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,030
dive right in let's talk about what

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,690
makes the Sega Genesis

53
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,820
special to me because I don't care if

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,140
it's special to you I only care of it's

55
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,330
special to me and I don't know if you

56
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,250
could tell by my leggings but I'm a huge

57
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,220
Sonic fan and that's because Sonic the

58
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,690
Hedgehog was the first video game I ever

59
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,840
played my first memories of video games

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,390
were from the Sega Genesis and I know

61
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,470
that you're all thinking wow she's

62
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,250
really young but it really stuck with me

63
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,630
and like video games were what

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,100
encouraged me to get into software

65
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,480
engineering and eventually hardware so

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,120
yeah but I mean that's what's been so

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,620
special to me but what makes it actually

68
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,530
sound unique right why out of all the

69
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,330
consoles would you want to build a

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,370
hardware synthesizer using the Sega

71
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,010
Genesis hardware well to answer that

72
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,360
question we need to talking a little bit

73
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,540
about history and what really makes

74
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,930
video game console music sound unique as

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,760
many of you probably already know early

76
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,980
video game consoles were extremely

77
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,660
resource constrained these were

78
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,520
essentially like eight or 16-bit

79
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,270
computers with like no RAM barely any

80
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,540
rom and they just couldn't playback

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,530
music like we do today there just wasn't

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,430
enough room to like give you a sort of

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,800
reference point an mp3 file is like four

84
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,330
Meg's in size for three and a half

85
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,700
minutes song the average NES game

86
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,380
there's 128 kilobytes and in the mp3

87
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,480
didn't even like get invented until 1993

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,959
so that wasn't an option so the

89
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,420
designers of these early consoles came

90
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,250
up with a brilliant idea instead of

91
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,900
playing back recorded music

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,940
they'll just store like digitize sheet

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,130
music and have the hardware actually go

94
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,280
and synthesize it in real time which is

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,370
a brilliant idea but it required

96
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,650
dedicated separate hardware to pull that

97
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,620
off and that's where these consoles were

98
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,010
to get their special voice so consoles

99
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,570
from the 80s before the Genesis came out

100
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,910
in 89

101
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,170
generally use pretty limited sound

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,550
hardware they use what's called

103
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,918
programmable sound generators or PS G's

104
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,060
and these like basically just had like

105
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,470
some of them just had square waves this

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,940
output and some of them just had

107
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,310
triangles but most of them could do a

108
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,070
of like square triangle and noise it

109
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,510
means you're pretty limited in the

110
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,710
number of instruments this is playing at

111
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,900
a time and what those instruments could

112
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,810
actually sound like and this is what

113
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,120
those look like if you have an iPad and

114
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,720
you draw them out but I actually want to

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,130
show you what they sound like

116
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,600
cuz sound is much more important to me

117
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,550
so I'm gonna start with a song that I

118
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,200
think almost everyone in this room will

119
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,050
know it is the theme to Super Mario

120
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,910
Brothers and I know this this talk is

121
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,440
about Sega but I have to get a Nintendo

122
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,169
a little bit of credit here this song

123
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,729
used the extremely limited palette of

124
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,229
the NES to create this iconic theme and

125
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,820
hopefully audio works so let's see if

126
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:20,169
this this happens all right everybody

127
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,060
knows that right it's like a nursery

128
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,250
rhyme to me

129
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,830
the melody is a square wave the vase is

130
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,110
a triangle wave and the drums that is

131
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,840
noise that's all you had to work with

132
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,330
that's it that's all the NES could do

133
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,150
and that's why all the music for every

134
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,830
NES game sounds like it's played by the

135
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,990
same band so Sega comes along in 89 and

136
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,750
they say we got to be easy Nintendo guys

137
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,470
like we can't we can't just just do what

138
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,700
they did we have to do it better

139
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,940
so Sega was like all right we're gonna

140
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,550
do something super cool they decided to

141
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,039
use a form of sound synthesis that was

142
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,010
really popular in professional audio at

143
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,900
the time but hadn't quite made its way

144
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,090
into home consoles this method was

145
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,530
called frequency modulation or FM

146
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,139
synthesis and unlike the release simple

147
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,190
waveforms that you can make with

148
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,440
programmable sound generators FM

149
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,410
synthesis could make thousands of unique

150
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,060
sounds so Sega contracted the world's

151
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,160
greatest jet ski slash motorcycle slash

152
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,289
piano company Yamaha to create the sound

153
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,840
engine for the Genesis Yamaha came back

154
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,919
with this chip this is the ym 2612 it is

155
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,620
a cost reduced feature limited version

156
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,450
of the same sound chip that Yamaha used

157
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:40,900
in its

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,750
legendary dx7 synthesizer which is I

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,970
think I meant to look this up so I don't

160
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,650
lie to you all but I think it's the

161
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,199
top-selling synthesizer of all time and

162
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,729
you can hear it in literally thousands

163
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,490
of songs like it take on the danger zone

164
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,600
all kinds of really rad rock songs and

165
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,280
so many others so we got the ym 26:12

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,250
what can it do well it was limited

167
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,870
compared to its bigger sisters of course

168
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,360
but it was still a very powerful sonic

169
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,520
engine to include in the Genesis as a

170
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,090
pun very much intended it contains six

171
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,949
voices so you could have like six

172
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,229
different sounds playing at the time and

173
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,870
each voice has 4 FM operators and we

174
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,580
can't really go into the details of how

175
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,320
FM synthesis works but the number of

176
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,880
operators basically tells you how

177
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,760
advanced the synthesizer is 4 is the

178
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,160
bare minimum to really make it sound

179
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,010
like anything at all so it is really

180
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,130
cost reduced for comparison the dx7 had

181
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,080
6 and it was considered revolutionary at

182
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,289
the time and modern FM synthesizers have

183
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,130
like 20 to 50 FM operators so things are

184
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,979
a little bit different these days and it

185
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,060
had like a lot of other really

186
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,199
interesting features that really put it

187
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,699
miles ahead of other consoles at the

188
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,630
time so to compare and contrast I'm

189
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,159
gonna let you hear a song that was

190
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,229
written for the sake of Genesis and I

191
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,360
know I know it's gonna sound dated here

192
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,090
in 2019 but I want you to compare that

193
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,500
to what we just heard from the Mario

194
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,810
soundtrack this was a huge leap forward

195
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,710
so let's listen

196
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,900
[Music]

197
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,940
that was rad right okay

198
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,010
I didn't I didn't write that song uh-huh

199
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,479
so yeah like isn't that a short clip we

200
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,159
heard like so many different sounds and

201
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,570
a unique sounds it was amazing what the

202
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,029
genesis is like the next level that you

203
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,169
played would be just completely

204
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,490
different and it would sound completely

205
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,399
different and it was amazing and it also

206
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,190
sounded like what music sounded like at

207
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,440
the time it didn't sound like dated or

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,450
limited it actually sounded like there

209
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,250
was you know a band in your living room

210
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,120
it's really really cool so that's all

211
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,130
awesome but this sort of Genesis being

212
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,779
the king of audio didn't last for long

213
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,170
the PlayStation was released and ruined

214
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,520
everything

215
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,029
it brought CD playback so audio hardware

216
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,399
like the ym 26:12 basically became

217
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,570
irrelevant because then we could just

218
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,760
play back pre-recorded audio through the

219
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
CD so the Genesis really happened at

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,380
this special moment in time where it

221
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,470
still made sense to include dedicated

222
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,339
hardware to make sound and the hardware

223
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,970
had advanced enough to do something like

224
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,800
awesome like FM synthesis and then right

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
afterwards CDs came along so that's what

226
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,270
gives it such a unique and awesome voice

227
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,660
alright so I love the Genesis and

228
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,180
hopefully you all do now if you don't we

229
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,810
can't be friends I wanted to use the

230
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,560
Genesis to make some music and while

231
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,209
there was an easy way out of this it's

232
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,399
called vsts virtual virtual instruments

233
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,200
basically you just download something

234
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
and you put it into your to Ableton Live

235
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,339
and you're good to go I could do the

236
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,890
easy route but I am hard-headed so I

237
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,920
said let's build a hardware synthesizer

238
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,470
for this because that's what more fun

239
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,950
it'll only take a few weeks so I wanted

240
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,380
to turn the ym 26:12 would steal the ym

241
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,810
26:12 out of a Sega Genesis and turn it

242
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,390
into a standalone Hardware synthesizer

243
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,250
so this is another wonderful iPad

244
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,260
illustration I wanted to be able to

245
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,819
control my hardware

246
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,129
the sizer from my computer over MIDI if

247
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,509
you don't know what MIDI is that's cool

248
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,539
it's the protocol that music hardware

249
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,189
uses to talk to each other so it can

250
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:42,749
send note on messages so if I press a

251
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:45,749
key here it sends a note on message to

252
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,639
my computer and then my computer relays

253
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,699
that note on message to synthesizer and

254
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,019
then the synthesizer makes noise so it's

255
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,139
like

256
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,540
cool that's how MIDI works and that's

257
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,589
what I wanted to build I was like

258
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:02,580
alright cool that's what we want to do

259
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,790
let's dive into this so looking at what

260
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,650
actually goes into the hardware module

261
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,620
itself is we're gonna have a

262
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,060
microcontroller and that

263
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,290
microcontrollers will be talking to the

264
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,810
computer over USB and then it's also

265
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,180
gonna be talking to the ym 26:12 so the

266
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,950
microcontrollers job is to translate

267
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,190
MIDI into stuff of the ym 2612

268
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,170
understands and we don't need any other

269
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,480
hardware from the Genesis we just need

270
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,070
that sound chip so this is easy right

271
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,570
all we have to do is learn how to talk

272
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,029
to the audio chip well it turns out it's

273
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:42,510
not that easy the Y o 26:12 basically

274
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,300
works as a as a big Ram chip and this is

275
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,589
how a lot of these chips and old

276
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,089
consoles work does that they were

277
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:49,980
basically just extensions of the CPUs

278
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,760
address space so basically you write

279
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,680
values to specific addresses in the

280
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,529
chips RAM or the chips address space and

281
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,140
it then uses those values to generate

282
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,910
sound so like one of those registers

283
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,680
determines the frequency of each channel

284
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,240
and one of those registers determines

285
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,589
whether or not it's playing a sound or

286
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:10,140
not so the channel on or off and then

287
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,120
there's because FM synthesis there's a

288
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,190
bunch of other parameters to control how

289
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,029
the sound like sounds the but umbra if

290
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,080
you will so it works like that which

291
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,730
sounds simple in theory but it's a very

292
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,540
very fussy chip this was this was the

293
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,410
80s like things were different then so

294
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,480
how do we even start right like how do

295
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,410
you even get started on this because

296
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,810
MIDI is complicated understanding the ym

297
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,540
26:12 register map is complicated what

298
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,690
do you do so I had this idea they build

299
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,160
a proof of concept and what I was gonna

300
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,040
do is just get the microcontroller

301
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,029
sending some canned data to the ym 2612

302
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,810
so I don't have to understand what these

303
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,370
registers do I just have to be able to

304
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,670
wire some hardware up and send messages

305
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,430
to it so there's actually a file format

306
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,160
for that called vgm and vgm is sort of

307
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,279
like

308
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,410
that digitized sheet music I mentioned

309
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,459
earlier it is a recording of the the

310
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,740
address and data buses from the Genesis

311
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,709
CPU when it's talking to the ym 26:12 so

312
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,000
all the microcontroller has to do is

313
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,670
play that back it looks like this it's

314
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,980
just a series of bytes like this that

315
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,379
say right to the yn 26:12 right at this

316
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:33,250
address I write this value cool if

317
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,199
you're wondering what vgm stands for it

318
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,910
stands for video game music which i

319
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,980
think it's hysterical because it only

320
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,959
works for sega stuff so it's from this

321
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,000
weird alternate universe where single

322
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,339
one and i really like that so proof of

323
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:48,970
concept

324
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,069
let's just get VG on playback working so

325
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,509
this is my first proof of concept

326
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:55,660
it's an Arduino and it's wired up to the

327
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,459
why I'm 26 12 and those videos really

328
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,750
small but don't worry it's irrelevant

329
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,209
and then this is what it sounds like

330
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,949
this is the first time I've ever got any

331
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:06,359
audio coming out of this thing at all

332
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,980
[Music]

333
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,070
look at her go I'm pretty sure that I

334
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,760
like clap to my hands and what yes after

335
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,269
that yeah yes thank you Scott

336
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,029
concept proved so that's it right we're

337
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,220
done

338
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,920
synthesizers are finished of course not

339
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,470
there's still a lot more work to do from

340
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,139
a proof-of-concept we go to a prototype

341
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:41,589
right so what I wanted to do here was

342
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,320
move from like a pile of wires on my

343
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,779
desk that is an Arduino and the 526 12

344
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,220
to like some kind of final hardware so I

345
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,040
put this all our breadboard and I moved

346
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,010
from Arduino to teensy 35 thank you Paul

347
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,250
which is super awesome and it is it has

348
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,139
an SD card which comes in handy later on

349
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,990
more speed a lot more IO it's this is

350
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,910
the teensy 35 so it works on 5-volt

351
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,440
logic levels which is great cassettes

352
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,209
with Hawaiian 2612 works with so I

353
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,389
didn't need logic level shifters have a

354
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,550
display and I have at the bottom there

355
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,880
that little purple board is a headphone

356
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,490
amplifier and that is the source of all

357
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,430
of my problems at this point

358
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,110
everything's too worked and it still

359
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,069
played back BGM files

360
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,460
cool so I had a perfectly functional

361
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,220
jukebox and this is where I ran into my

362
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,820
first real challenge with this project

363
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,020
the audio coming out of this thing is

364
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,540
extremely noisy and when I give a

365
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,910
practice talk someone said to me what is

366
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,490
audio noise and I know this is gonna be

367
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,839
really dated reference but like if you

368
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,630
ever tried the tuner radio and like

369
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,800
you're in between channels and it's like

370
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,500
like it's like that and it drowns out

371
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,779
the signal that you want to hear and we

372
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,220
have to solve that because I want to use

373
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,870
this as a professional audio synthesizer

374
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,180
so we can't just have this noise

375
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,230
drowning out my signal so what's causing

376
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,510
noise how do we fix it that's the

377
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,000
question and I didn't know because I

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,740
don't know anything about hardware this

379
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,230
is my first project I'm a software

380
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,360
engineer when there is noise I go and

381
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,890
blame someone else so what do you do

382
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,290
well I did a bunch of research and the

383
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,580
first thing I found out was that the why

384
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,410
I'm 26 12 is weird who would have

385
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,089
thought the short story is that the

386
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,070
audio output coming out of the Y I'm 26

387
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,310
12 is not quite what you would expect

388
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,160
from modern like audio level signals

389
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,750
like the headphone amplifiers expecting

390
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,089
a certain impedance a certain level and

391
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,220
the why I'm 26 12 is just not giving at

392
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,810
that so solution there is to build an

393
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,630
amplifier that can work with the line

394
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,870
2612 output so this is more research

395
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,610
research is a very good thing to do when

396
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,740
you don't know anything I found a really

397
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,600
excellent mod for the Genesis called the

398
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,390
mega amp it uses relatively modern audio

399
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,670
great components to create audio clear

400
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,260
audio from the console that can form

401
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,760
some modern standards this is an

402
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,010
extremely popular mod and all kinds of

403
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,449
people do it because apparently the

404
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,880
headphone output on the original Genesis

405
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,839
is really bad but yeah so all I do is

406
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
stick the schematic that I could barely

407
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,560
read and modify it for my my synthesizer

408
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,740
easy right just go and build that turns

409
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,840
out that like analog circuits are really

410
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,300
hard up until this point in my like

411
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,030
hardware career I had only worked with

412
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,370
digital like stuff right I've made my

413
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,929
Arduino oblique a light and

414
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,629
I managed to like proof of concept this

415
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,850
ym 26:12 like a hard way talking to a

416
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,999
while I'm 26 12 that was easy compared

417
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,309
to building an analog circuit this is my

418
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,529
third attempt and it is the first one

419
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,950
that worked this is on a proto board and

420
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,289
yeah it was really hard and the problem

421
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,519
is like I didn't know how to debug this

422
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,940
I had to learn how to do that I had to

423
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,649
guess and like be like okay well maybe I

424
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,289
get this capacitor backwards or or like

425
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,720
maybe I've managed to fry the IC when I

426
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,279
was soldering it on I just didn't know

427
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,039
what I was doing so yeah that was hard

428
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,619
but I finally got it to work and I moved

429
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:20,909
everything helps on to prote accords as

430
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:24,409
well and I was like man that looks slick

431
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,590
so noise is gone right no absolutely not

432
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,869
things were less noisy but still like

433
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,820
unbearably noisy not something I'd want

434
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,450
to reuse in a professional audio setting

435
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,289
so back to research right I made good

436
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,970
progress but I needed I wanted to go

437
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,340
further here I really wanted to get get

438
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,379
rid of this noise all together so I did

439
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,299
some research and it turns out there's a

440
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,039
lot of noise sources for analog circuits

441
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,049
bread boards and pota boards acted like

442
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,759
big antennas and they just soak up

443
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,100
electromagnetic interference so that

444
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,440
could be a problem the USB power supply

445
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
is notoriously noisy and any noise and

446
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,889
the power supply will be noise in here

447
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:08,519
your audio the circuit so cool the thing

448
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,929
that I'm using to power this project

449
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,019
isn't working the teensy has a switching

450
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,330
regulator on it and that's wonderful for

451
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,429
efficiency but it's not as great for

452
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,460
audio the display has a buck regulator a

453
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,279
buck boost regulator and it is awful for

454
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,289
audio so we got to fix that I didn't

455
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:29,460
want to try to fix all of this right I

456
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,779
don't want to try to redesign the teensy

457
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,289
to not use a switching regulator so I

458
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,240
decided to do two things to use a

459
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,480
separate external power supply so I'm

460
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,279
using a 9 volt power supply and it goes

461
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,529
into two separate linear regulators on

462
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,139
my board one side for the analog set of

463
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,610
things and one side for the digital side

464
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:47,999
of things

465
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,799
and this is enough isolation to

466
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,710
eliminate noise from the power supply

467
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,370
and from the switching regulators on the

468
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,160
lateen see in the display and the other

469
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,240
thing I decided to do was eliminate

470
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,070
proto boards which is exactly what I use

471
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,230
to build my project so know you're all

472
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,960
thinking right now is wait how would you

473
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,340
eliminate the thing that you built your

474
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,250
project on you just learn how to make

475
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,600
PCBs of course because it's that easy

476
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,540
just so simple as a beginner and like as

477
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,580
it's just a total newb to hardware I was

478
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,710
like that's not possible right like you

479
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,690
have to like just like go to college or

480
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,760
something for this or like at least take

481
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,780
an online course I turns out I do

482
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,820
actually know nothing and it's really

483
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,980
actually very approachable to design

484
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,470
your own PCB there's excellent free

485
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,050
software I use kicad and there's cheap

486
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,430
prototyping services out there I'm not

487
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,600
gonna name any names because you all

488
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,750
know them all and I watched a video

489
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,610
seriously did you key with Sean in it so

490
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,780
I know Sean's around here somewhere so

491
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,400
Thank You Sean

492
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,230
and yeah I drew up the PCBs for this and

493
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,730
I actually learned a really neat trick

494
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,230
while I was researching this which is to

495
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,990
print your PCBs out on paper and then

496
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,310
use that to test your component sizes

497
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,900
before you order them because that way

498
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,950
you don't have to wait like two weeks

499
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,240
before you find out that you made a

500
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,360
mistake I still made mistakes but it

501
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,680
helped me cut down on a number of

502
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,410
mistakes so this is what one of the PCBs

503
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,200
looks like for the sent and Kiki this is

504
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,870
the motherboard and on the side here is

505
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,550
the teensy on them in the middle there's

506
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,230
the 126th ROM and at the top is the two

507
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,820
voltage regulators that I mentioned and

508
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,450
then here's all three of them fresh from

509
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,670
the PCB manufacturer and this is the

510
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,460
front in the back so that the one

511
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,500
furthest away is the display board the

512
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,400
one in the middle of the motherboard

513
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,440
that you just saw and the one closest to

514
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,020
the camera is the audio board yeah I

515
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,760
actually designed the audio board first

516
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,730
because I don't have any sense it's the

517
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,710
most complicated one and I designed it

518
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,020
first I have no explanation for why I

519
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,720
did that and then you just put it all

520
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,070
together right and it's gonna work the

521
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,710
first time it actually did work the

522
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,470
first

523
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,700
[Applause]

524
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,720
legitimately the only thing that went

525
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,669
right in this project and subsequent

526
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,169
projects that I've dug now that I've

527
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:07,059
fallen in love with hardware have not

528
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,950
worked out that way

529
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,440
and so I laser cut a nice acrylic case

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,270
for it and now it's a beautiful

531
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,160
synthesizer nice huh all right but we

532
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,210
forgot about something software up until

533
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,340
this point it's a beautiful jukebox

534
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,520
it plays BGM but I don't want to use

535
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,140
fijian I don't want a jukebox

536
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,510
I want a synthesizer so needs to learn

537
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,080
MIDI so going back to what we talked

538
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,330
about earlier the path to that is that

539
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,799
we need to teach the team see how to

540
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,320
turn MIDI and to stuff that the ym 2612

541
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,890
understands and the problem is though

542
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,850
the ym 2612 has no documentation because

543
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,040
why would it be documented like not even

544
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,799
from Yamaha themselves I emailed them

545
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,419
about this and apparently they're too

546
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:56,620
busy making jet skis to write

547
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,179
documentation that's what they said

548
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,030
so obviously you turn to reverse

549
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,270
engineering at this point right because

550
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,919
that's my specialty it's reverse

551
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,419
engineering I'm kidding

552
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,890
most of the secrets here have been

553
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,429
discovered by others the problem is that

554
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,140
the resources that are out there for the

555
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,179
why I'm 26:12 are great if you want to

556
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,010
write a Sega Genesis emulator or if you

557
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,020
want to write homebrew a game for the

558
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,840
Sega Genesis but they make all kinds of

559
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,220
assumptions about hardware that just are

560
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,940
not true

561
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,490
so they're not great for learning how to

562
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,700
actually speak to a real chip so what do

563
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,740
we do well I mentioned that that the why

564
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,120
enjoys child is part of a bigger family

565
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,220
of chips right there was one in the dx7

566
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,130
that had more operators and stuff it

567
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,600
turns out some of those chips have

568
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,820
manuals and that's wonderful because

569
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,410
they're all from the same family and

570
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,669
share lineage they should have the same

571
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,370
electrical and timing characteristics

572
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,640
cool the problem is say Yamaha is also

573
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,130
too busy making pianos to write their

574
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,010
manuals in English and I don't know any

575
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,910
Japanese um I did not learn how to how

576
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,940
to read Japanese for this project I

577
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,620
think feliu have some friends that the

578
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:08,809
hell

579
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,940
you know but it still came down to a lot

580
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,110
of trial and error I legitimately had a

581
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,490
loop and a button at one point where

582
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,200
when I'd press a button it would make

583
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,720
the right cycle slightly longer until

584
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,970
things started working it works I don't

585
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,100
know what to say and this is like I

586
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,749
finally got it working and this is kind

587
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,149
of like what translating one message

588
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,279
looks like to the team see you get MIDI

589
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,019
in which is note on which I showed you

590
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,120
earlier the teensy has to assign one of

591
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,279
the six channels has to calculate the

592
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,340
frequency and block number which is a

593
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,039
special weirdness of the ym 26:12 it has

594
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,509
to send that data to the Y intrinsics 12

595
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:49,549
and then it has to turn the channel on

596
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,070
and what the why I'm 26 12 C's is just

597
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,399
these three rights like the first two

598
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,549
bytes there are the frequency and the

599
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:59,690
last byte there it just turns the

600
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,860
channel on so that's what we get but a

601
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,450
synth needs to do more than just make

602
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,090
noise it need to be usable as an

603
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,919
instrument there was so much more

604
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,450
involved in the software that I wish I

605
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,460
could go into here and surprisingly

606
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,070
despite me being a software engineer the

607
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,419
software took me way longer than the

608
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,639
hardware and I still make tweaks to it

609
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,200
like every time I do a cover of another

610
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,210
song using the synthesizer I'm like oh

611
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,590
it'd be really cool to have this feature

612
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,320
covering this song so much easier so I'm

613
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,230
still making changes to it the software

614
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,580
has evolved more than the hardware at

615
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,629
this point so yeah so that brings us to

616
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:37,610
here now and I guess showed you earlier

617
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,019
this is the complete of synthesizer and

618
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,299
it's upside down

619
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,710
so use your imagination and flip it

620
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,639
right side up

621
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,999
and how would y'all feel about making

622
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:49,010
some music together

623
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,799
[Applause]

624
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,270
cool beans that still works that's great

625
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:10,270
son how we looking on time five minutes

626
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,809
perfect alright so we got five minutes

627
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,179
let's make a song five minutes before I

628
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:18,160
make a song for y'all I want to show you

629
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,480
that this thing can sound like a lot of

630
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,130
different stuff so let's start with an

631
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,710
organ sound because I think some of you

632
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:31,780
may like Castlevania or something that's

633
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,120
pretty cool something like Zelda right

634
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,250
it's just of Rage I'm not that good at

635
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,400
piano

636
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,950
[Music]

637
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,069
[Applause]

638
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,630
so yeah sacrilege to play a Nintendo

639
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,620
song in a sec of synthesizer right but

640
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,549
let's talk about some fun stuff so I

641
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,150
wanted to do a sort of nine early 90s

642
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,679
inspired song for y'all

643
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,660
for this demo so I got some really like

644
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,090
early 90s beats for y'all so let's play

645
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:16,870
this play this drum beat this is my drum

646
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,990
beat pretty simple right I don't want to

647
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,840
do anything complicated for y'all cool

648
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,390
all right so first thing you need if

649
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,820
you're gonna make a early 90s influenced

650
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,750
sense song is bass I'm gonna find a bass

651
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,030
patch that's pretty good

652
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,180
[Music]

653
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,149
that's pretty chunky alright let's do

654
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:46,629
some bass and I'm a mess this up but

655
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:49,709
it's okay I have backups

656
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,249
all right cool that's our base for the

657
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:15,190
synthesizer can do some nice bass we're

658
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:24,509
just pop thank you so on top of our base

659
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,090
we need some chords right like every

660
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,349
like an early 90s song needs like some

661
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:38,619
smooth cordage so let's listen to a

662
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,039
couple things

663
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,470
closer

664
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,509
[Music]

665
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,990
I like that what do y'all think all

666
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,120
right cool let's put some chords on it

667
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,270
then

668
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,329
[Music]

669
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,860
okay don't laugh don't laugh yet Dyke

670
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,710
gonna throw me off some of you are quick

671
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,210
studies but for your friends that may be

672
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,039
behind please don't give it away yet

673
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,820
there's one more part we need to do one

674
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,750
second

675
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,089
[Music]

676
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:43,010
so obviously this formative track needs

677
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,299
a melody and it needs to be something

678
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,769
memorable something that you would maybe

679
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:50,269
send your friends without prompting or

680
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,710
tell them that it's something else or

681
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,360
trick an entire conference into

682
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,769
listening to I think that's a pretty

683
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:03,409
good sound for what do y'all think all

684
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:03,890
right

685
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,970
[Music]

686
