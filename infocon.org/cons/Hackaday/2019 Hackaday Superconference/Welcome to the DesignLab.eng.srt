1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
so we're just gonna give a little

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,470
context to this place and we're mostly

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,120
wanting to answer any questions you guys

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,130
have at the end so keep those in mind

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,900
because we want lots of questions

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,280
that'll make it more exciting and

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,410
interesting so a little background

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,480
supply frame is our parent company

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,400
they're right up the street at Fair Oaks

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,350
in green you may have been there last

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,199
night for raging festivities to kick off

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,230
the super con weekend they make software

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,689
as-a-service tools for the electronics

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,310
industry to help manage supply chain

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,320
mostly working with electronics

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,120
manufacturers and distributors they

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
opened up this space about four years

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,219
ago and we are a 4,000 square-foot

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,820
design and fabrication facility we not

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,050
only do do community public and private

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,789
events but we also host designers and

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,989
engineers in residence and we're gonna

23
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,879
get into all of that in more detail

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
throughout this presentation before we

25
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,079
get to those things though we wanted to

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,300
just introduce our team here you've

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,920
probably seen a few of these people

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,379
running around this weekend

29
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,390
Erika Earle is our electrical engineer

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,479
she's giving pick-and-place demos you

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,010
may have just seen her over lunch doing

32
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,930
that down in the loading dock and she'll

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,799
be doing more of those throughout the

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,270
weekends you can find her to learn more

35
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,159
about that equipment

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,650
Bruce Dominguez is our rapid prototyping

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,110
technician he's running around helping

38
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,000
with workshops he's happy to answer any

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,490
more questions as well and then as we

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,580
said we're magenta and Giovanni and

41
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,630
that's the team here we're really

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,689
excited to bring this equipment to the

43
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:31,890
community and make it more accessible

44
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,950
and answer any sorts of questions

45
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,479
throughout events and programming and

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,740
that sort of thing so as you can see we

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,159
have lots of exciting tools and things

48
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,570
so we're gonna go through sort of

49
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,700
quickly because it's a quick

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
presentation and we want lots of time

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
for questions but we have various 3d

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,140
printers FDM SLA PolyJet we also have

53
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,390
wood shop equipment CNC machines varying

54
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,219
from small desktop cncs to large 4x8 CNC

55
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,380
Mills and then we have some Electronics

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,000
prototyping and small scale

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,709
manufacturing equipment down in the

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,849
loading dock that you've probably seen

59
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,459
and also our injection machine

60
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,440
am I forgetting anything and the laser

61
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,170
cutter and a small vinyl cutter in the

62
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,000
pickin place part of electronics

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,459
manufacturing equipment yeah so we'll

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,930
get into detail with questions I think

65
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,970
because we could spend hours going into

66
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,400
each and every one of those tools but

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,900
you can find us also after if we don't

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,390
have time for that and then the space

69
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,890
you're in right now actually doesn't

70
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,569
usually look like this

71
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,520
we can do this for different meetups and

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,680
presentations lectures panels but

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,200
usually this is our sort of co-working

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,170
space for internal staff and then our

75
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,500
resin engineers and designers

76
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,190
first-come-first-serve be able to spread

77
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,550
out and get to work in here so usually

78
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,660
it's a bunch of tables with people

79
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,400
working but we like the flexibility of

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
being able to host things like this so

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,910
we probably most common question is how

82
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,890
do you get involved with this space or

83
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,180
get access to the tools and equipment

84
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,239
outside of the events that we'll talk

85
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,480
about you can apply for a residency the

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,550
application is still on supply framed

87
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,549
comm slash design lab and has it's a

88
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,230
Google form and it's really just to get

89
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,209
your name and proposal into our system

90
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,620
and then we'll follow up with interviews

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,760
and see if it's the right fit we with

92
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,410
the residency you get access to the

93
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,940
equipment of course you get our

94
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,610
expertise and then you get a materials

95
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,040
budget sort of depending on your project

96
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,180
and the scale of what you're trying to

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,010
do so you can get started pretty easily

98
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,400
and it's yes it's free of charge all

99
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,660
that we ask is that we're able to

100
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,359
document your process and use it to be

101
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,880
able to write different content both

102
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,280
editorial for a hackaday and also on

103
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,930
video content so that we can promote

104
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,190
what's happening at the lab so

105
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,690
Giovanni's going to tell you about some

106
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,489
of our special projects which is what we

107
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,100
do in addition to our different kinds of

108
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,450
events and the residency projects thank

109
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,720
you so yes in addition to the residency

110
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,000
program and the community events that we

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,489
host we also develop products in-house

112
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,850
and this these are two interesting

113
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,579
products that we developed fully at the

114
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,430
design lab number one is willow and the

115
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,650
other one is the cube which you probably

116
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,300
saw last year

117
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,099
so willow is a device that it is

118
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,099
connected well it it monitors how people

119
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,289
wash their hands or sanitize their hands

120
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,300
when they move from room to room in

121
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,300
hospitals and it was full as I said it

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,069
was fully developed here we are

123
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,220
electronic engineer voya he developed

124
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,550
all the electronics PCB design etc and

125
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,280
we are the design lab created the

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,069
enclosure not only from the design and

127
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,720
development point of view but we also

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,479
printed them with our form labs

129
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,990
equipment then made other components

130
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,500
with tormach this model has a ring in

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,509
the middle that serves its its

132
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,479
structural and we made it with the CNC

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
machine we also created molds for

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,620
casting resin so we had a little knot a

135
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,169
little a short-run production of how

136
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,180
many probably like 300 sets of this all

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,129
of them made here so it took us a while

138
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:34,050
it wasn't an overnight project but yes

139
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,199
everything was made here and this parts

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
or these components I should say are

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,460
being tested at hospitals right now and

142
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,590
yeah it's it's going well so that's

143
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,960
that's one kind of project the other one

144
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,940
is the cube and as I said if you were

145
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,650
here last year you probably saw an

146
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,349
orange cube with some kind of cryptic

147
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,610
function it is the supply frame logo

148
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,360
made in 3d it was successful it was

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,699
interesting and we are now in the third

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,490
edition that first one was presented

151
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,219
first here then we the second end in

152
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,139
munich munich I keep forgetting I keep

153
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,810
saying Frankfurt its Munich and the

154
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,560
second one went to China to promote our

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,139
service warm to buy and now we're

156
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,120
working on the third version this one is

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,669
interesting too because we designed and

158
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,550
develop the product here but all mass

159
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,370
production was made or is made in China

160
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,589
so we're coordinating not only the

161
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,340
electronics but also plastic and jack

162
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,300
like pipes etc you know so once we

163
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,940
develop that here oversee production yep

164
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,900
and some thing about our capabilities

165
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,720
here I think that's important to mention

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,250
is that I or something that I really

167
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,070
appreciate is that we have a lot of

168
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,480
analog and digital fabrication tools

169
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,590
that I think really complement each

170
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,090
other like you don't need a 3d printer

171
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,410
or laser cutter for everything sometimes

172
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,850
you just need to chop it off on the

173
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,130
bandsaw and we have that stuff but then

174
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,570
when you're ready to make high fidelity

175
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,000
looks like works like prototype we have

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,170
sort of the appropriate tools for that

177
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,970
and the in-between stage as you're

178
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,740
starting to design for manufacturer and

179
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,170
you need a small run for like Joe was

180
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,750
saying you know first test run or to

181
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,910
show it it may be an investor to

182
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,070
convince them then it makes sense

183
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,970
different things like that so I think

184
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,880
we're really great at that that

185
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,250
in-between stage maybe from you have one

186
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
solid prototype and you want to get to

187
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,600
10 or 20 and start to learn how to

188
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,550
design for manufacture or work with

189
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,110
contract manufacturers and get that

190
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,750
process going so the other way to get

191
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,420
involved of course is our events we have

192
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,280
all different kinds of things that we

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,690
feel like we've already mentioned a few

194
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,980
times so if you have any questions about

195
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,630
that please feel free to ask

196
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,510
we have various workshops we have panels

197
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,000
we have the hackaday la meetup every

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,710
other month and then a modular

199
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,300
manifestation is a newer meetup we

200
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,240
started that's gonna continue into 2020

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
where we have a bunch of awesome synth

202
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,300
performance stuff going on and DIY like

203
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,110
we made the all flesh pads at the last

204
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,000
one so different workshops learn how to

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,680
solder and things like that some of our

206
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,720
other workshops happen in collaboration

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,550
with local organizations like connect

208
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,080
week that we do with innovate Pasadena

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,440
where we'll do 3d printing workshops

210
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,270
small-scale electronics manufacturing

211
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,380
make like a little lamp and different

212
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,760
things like that and then we've done

213
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,250
table-cell workshops amongst those so

214
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,260
you can keep an eye out for that on

215
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,780
Facebook Eventbrite and Instagram where

216
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,789
supply frame design lab we'd love for

217
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,590
you to check us out there you can find

218
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,750
out more about current events what we're

219
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,030
up to behind the scenes and then please

220
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,500
reach out to collaborate where I was

221
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
looking like I love

222
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,020
rekon because I meet all kinds of people

223
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,460
that we can invite back to do workshops

224
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,730
to do demos to do talks we're hosting

225
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,740
talks and things throughout the year so

226
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,360
we can never have too many awesome

227
