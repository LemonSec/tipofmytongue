[Applause]

6
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,580
thank you for sticking around this is

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,280
perhaps our favorite part of superc on

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
our favorite part of super con so I

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
think we should probably give a couple

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,090
of thank-yous about the badge do it

11
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,410
first of all force the foremost we have

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,500
to say thanks to sprite TM aka your own

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,200
John Borg for doing all of the heavy

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,420
lifting on this badge but then also to

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,660
the entire badge team all of whose names

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,490
are up here everyone here contributed

17
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,650
something to the badge some of them

18
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,340
absolutely tons at clutch moments it's

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,000
been quite a ride I think that's all you

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,130
can say there are a couple of mini

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,600
competitions going on here one of them

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,250
is completely unofficial we would like

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,540
to invite up to the stage

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,640
Kenneth Finnegan to talk about the kawah

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,880
Oracle puzzle

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,050
welcome Kenneth please gentlemen thank

27
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,600
you thank you so if just in case you

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,770
didn't see I was walking around all

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,229
weekend with this cardboard box this was

30
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,880
built on Hacker train to Super Kong

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,500
which is the mini con that none of you

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,758
knew about and so you likely had me I am

33
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,020
likely if I'm going to asked you to push

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,220
the button on this in which case you got

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,400
a cow that told you your fortune

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,110
remember these fortunes were from the

37
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,069
cow not me

38
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,390
so if it said that you're gonna hit by a

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,790
bus I'm sorry the main thing was that

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,140
there was also every once in a while it

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,900
gave you a puzzle piece and so if any of

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,880
you got the Friday puzzle pieces it

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,709
likely told you to deliver it to someone

44
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,160
working for hackaday or supply frame and

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,410
so first of all thank you for trolling

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,000
all of the people that really did not

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,030
have any time to deal with looking at

48
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,849
hexadecimal I'm going to read the

49
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,550
solution for stage one in the form of

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,830
the code used to generate the

51
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,220
hexadecimal for stage 1 for X in

52
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,860
sequence 1 through 8 print random

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,580
integer in the range 0 a 65535

54
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,060
[Applause]

55
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,800
now that being said a lot of you were

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
not following the instructions and just

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,800
delivering this to supply frame people

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
so I got a little concerned since some

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,410
of you were trying to find the deeper

60
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,680
meaning and entropy and so for the

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,600
second day I made two changes first of

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,070
all Brian been chef was getting so

63
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,080
pissed off that I made him 1/3 of the

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,530
time get delivered the solutions and the

65
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,000
second one things that I actually made a

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,040
real puzzle so this actually is a real

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,760
puzzle I know that one team actually did

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,650
manage to decode it so I would like to

69
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,620
congratulate malort where the wonderful

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,410
team of people that solve this I'm not

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,090
going to explain exactly how to decode

72
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,770
it so if you would like to get the

73
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,320
puzzle and try and break the code you

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,330
are welcome to find me afterwards but I

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,190
will read the solution to you in its

76
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,000
final form the stage 1 hints world why

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,350
the real puzzle is why are you spending

78
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,080
time solving this instead of meeting

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,330
more awesome people at Super Khan thank

80
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,989
you let's hear it for Kenneth then again

81
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,880
another insanely great challenge we have

82
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,410
going on for the second year here is the

83
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,988
SMD challenge run by Al Williams out

84
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,279
come on up and talk about this challenge

85
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,710
everybody have a good conference all

86
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,930
right bye applause did you do the SMD

87
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,350
challenge this year or last year Wow

88
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,200
okay we actually added challenges this

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
year so we got more people through this

90
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,070
year than last year so we were amazed

91
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,650
last year because Kevin Jordan in 2018

92
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,010
got 16 minutes and 18 seconds and he

93
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,050
actually told me he said I'm gonna get

94
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,150
beat everybody's time and I thought okay

95
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,490
yeah but he did and it was like five or

96
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,860
six minutes faster than anybody else did

97
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,740
this year like at least four people beat

98
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,800
that time and beat it by a lot so that's

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,860
pretty crazy and let's say I'm trying to

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,440
remember I think Zack did the hackaday

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,470
IO board and Freddie did the tindy board

102
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,450
and they're pretty neat-looking given

103
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,250
that if you haven't done the challenge

104
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,750
you get to use the automotive style

105
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,070
soldering irons

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,190
so they're pretty fun look at that time

107
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,440
Fred T six minutes 45 seconds and a

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,780
score of four point nine out of five

109
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,579
[Applause]

110
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,570
and I'm going to tell you if you haven't

111
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,979
done the challenge yet you can't

112
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,440
appreciate exactly what that means

113
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,080
so is Fred are you here okay so he took

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,979
best score and best time and it will get

115
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,530
him an award like we did last year where

116
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,080
we're handing out four awards so top two

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,180
on scores and top two ones on time so

118
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,380
you can only get one Zack F at 7:43 and

119
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,539
three point eight which is still pretty

120
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,750
respectable are you here Zack No

121
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,900
okay we're batting zero and maistro' had

122
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,330
eight point two five and four point six

123
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,419
and we had that on Friday and when

124
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,460
caught oh well he's he's taking it and

125
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,289
it turns out he came in third so that's

126
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,840
crazy on the best times

127
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,430
oddly enough the first and third on

128
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,199
scores are also the first and third on

129
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,080
times Greg who's the guy who has the

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,550
nice 20-sided led cube he came in with

131
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,580
12 48 and 4.8 and the work was very very

132
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,349
nice which isn't surprising I guess

133
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:42,289
right are you here big round for drag

134
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:49,490
and then no prize but at the 4.6 level

135
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,280
Alex L and Patrick L but you'll notice

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,340
the 4.6 azar good but the times were

137
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,110
less and a we clearly say in the rules

138
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,449
if they you got a tie it's the times so

139
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,520
and I think that's all we've got but big

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,370
big round for everybody that did the

141
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,190
challenge and we'll see you next year

142
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,120
can you come up quickly

143
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,990
Fred Zack maestro and Greg for your $100

144
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,639
tindy gift certificate tindy gift card

145
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Zach

146
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,569
[Applause]

147
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,970
not only were people working on the

148
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,150
official badge there were people hacking

149
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,520
basically everything that moves so we'd

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,340
like to quickly give people who did work

151
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,100
on the unofficial badge a chance to show

152
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,170
off what they got one-minute demos and

153
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,270
to do that I'd like to call up Sophie

154
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:13,650
Kravitz yeah if you did anything with

155
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,150
the machine learning badge made by

156
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,770
Adafruit and digit key line up over here

157
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,400
for one-minute demos nobody oh no I see

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:31,280
some people up

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,640
all right I made a working spectrograph

160
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,620
using the microphone built into the

161
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,990
badge and also so that's just reading

162
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,730
the DC to 4 kilohertz DC to 4 kilohertz

163
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,320
and versus time and also a and also a

164
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,600
tilt sensor and in spectrograph first

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:23,350
time so this is a mobile robot that was

166
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,530
made to plant tree saplings it's a

167
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,370
collaboration between myself Sarah as

168
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,030
well as even and we use the Adafruit

169
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,410
edge badge to power this robot so it has

170
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,620
a state machine for autonomous mode uses

171
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,230
the light sensor to find the brightest

172
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,490
spot to plant the tree then it asks you

173
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,610
should I plant a tree here you can say

174
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,490
either yes or no we're still working on

175
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,740
integrating the whole AI on the edge

176
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,850
part but when you say yes it will plant

177
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,480
a tree like that so the tree sapling

178
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,510
lives in there and then we also have

179
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,150
another servo for water just that the

180
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,150
water vessel is not there so I can give

181
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,570
a functional demo now of the autonomous

182
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,080
mode

183
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
right now what it's doing is it's search

184
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,029
mode so when I press the button it's

185
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,950
sort of woke up now it's in its search

186
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,370
State so when we shine a light onto it

187
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,700
it will stop searching and want to ask

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:03,300
to plant a tree there was the bright

189
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,089
light and then it plants the tree and

190
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,200
now it continues on

191
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,710
[Music]

192
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,629
[Applause]

193
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,000
hey I'm Alex so this badge does two

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,230
things one of which I've wanted to do

195
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,270
forever which is it just tracks the

196
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,410
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

197
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,520
at some point if I get around to it

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,780
maybe I can integrate some machine

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,180
learning to detect when I've dozed off

200
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,850
and correlate that concentration the

201
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,550
second thing I've wanted to do for like

202
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,840
two or three days which is the laser oh

203
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,050
sorry

204
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,210
the laser dangling off the back of it

205
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,080
will issue commands to Google home which

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,510
if it takes less than a minute for the

207
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,860
thing to connect to Wi-Fi up on the

208
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,780
stage it still definitely won't work

209
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,460
anyway so you'll have to ask me for a

210
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,940
video later but it does work like with

211
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,440
literally no hardware so you should go

212
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:17,650
try it it's SuperDuper easy do you have

213
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,120
anyone else who wants to show their

214
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
machine learning badge

215
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,480
alright next good

216
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,500
thanks a lot that brings us then to the

217
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,200
official badge hacks as before we have

218
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,480
four different categories we have FPGA

219
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,170
hacks app hacks demo scene if anyone did

220
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,030
graphics and/or audio and hardware hacks

221
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,160
so if you have an FBA fpg a hack come on

222
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,900
over here to the side of stage line up

223
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,610
and come on up

224
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,890
oh the prizes our first place gets $100

225
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,710
green things in your hand right now and

226
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,100
the second two prizes get hundred second

227
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,770
two places get hundred dollar tindy gift

228
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,000
certificates judging is by audience

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,410
enthusiasm so we're gonna ask you to

230
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,700
clap so if you can remember the often

231
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,590
absurd titles we make up for these

232
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,890
projects please do you'll have to clap

233
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,640
for them by name in a minute if you've

234
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,240
got round applause please for hi tennis

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,009
okay so I don't have any graphics

236
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,269
besides what's here

237
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,089
so the first act was to take the this

238
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,910
beautiful ws2812 panel which actually

239
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,860
comes from the first super colony in San

240
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,110
Francisco and never used it I thought if

241
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,749
PGA is going to work well with that and

242
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:52,519
so thanks to Matt van who actually

243
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,790
already had a piece of fpga F to talk to

244
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,369
ws2812 I integrated that into this badge

245
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:02,389
put it into the app so I could control

246
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,910
it from the Sealand and so this gives

247
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,170
the nyan cat but also and maybe more

248
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:15,559
impressive now I can play Tetris on 8x8

249
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,860
matrix

250
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,149
[Applause]

251
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,000
okay and all of our FPGA acts actually

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
started with another attempt so at the

253
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,610
top of the badge we have a little add-on

254
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,290
that we made to send and receive

255
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,600
infrared then when we got here we

256
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,399
realize we actually have infrared on the

257
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,290
badge so we're gonna try to use this and

258
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,649
so we've been making a very simple fpga

259
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,970
core to send 38 kilohertz pulse on the

260
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,800
ir LED that's already on the badge and

261
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,660
then using the ceilin code we're just

262
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,110
dog lling the enable pin on the LED turn

263
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,540
the IR transceiver and then from there

264
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,000
we can send basically any IR codes and

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,790
so that gives our second demo with my

266
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,810
friend trace here and and Sophie is

267
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,899
helping to and so basically we have a

268
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,410
flying shark that's remote-control by

269
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,470
infrared Christian sure hey everyone so

270
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,390
we've done Vera log we've done C and

271
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,790
some Python at this event thank you so

272
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,100
much to the synth workshop that was so

273
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,690
amazing from that we were able to take

274
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,540
that and do a 38 kilohertz modulation on

275
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,480
the IR transmitter on all of our badges

276
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,900
and so with that we are able to actually

277
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,850
do like rely our stuff now including

278
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,839
this so this this this is a shark this

279
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,620
is a flying shark and so we've got a

280
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,029
bunch of controls on here so first

281
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,250
sophie is as it we're we're okay so the

282
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,839
the control mode it's in right now is

283
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,040
the one that just came out of the box

284
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,400
this one you hold let the the fin goes

285
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,270
left you hold right the fin goes right

286
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,900
so that was a that was a great mode that

287
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
was that was fun to play with but it was

288
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
like um it was like a track-and-field

289
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,709
you button mash to go forward you button

290
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,290
mash to go left now Sophie do you want

291
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,399
to demonstrate beast mode because it's a

292
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,510
shark

293
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,390
so in beast mode now the the badge is

294
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,730
doing all the work for you you can hold

295
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,220
a and it will swivel left and right and

296
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,140
left and right and go forward you can

297
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,279
hold left and it will go more left than

298
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,660
right and if you go right

299
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,190
then it'll go more right than left it's

300
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,220
been the blast making this so many

301
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,900
people have helped it's been so much fun

302
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,870
working with Thomas thank you all so

303
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,630
much for listening hope you had a great

304
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:03,610
con thank you very much

305
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,349
I our shark do you have a name I our

306
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:14,949
shark fantastic next if you have video

307
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:24,220
let me know and we'll plug in hi my name

308
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,449
is Jacob Caden we've got Michael Welling

309
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:33,070
and drew fuss teeny we have Linux

310
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:43,030
running on the badge with through the

311
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,310
semi blurry camera image you can see

312
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,340
we've got a login prompt here the the

313
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,840
badge runs a little bit slow it takes

314
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,970
about three minutes to boot so don't

315
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,700
quite fit our one minute demo window so

316
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,870
it's already booted to accomplish this

317
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:05,170
we created a or a SDRAM cartridge that

318
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,100
sits on the back gives us 32 megabytes

319
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,770
of a single data rate SDRAM it's there

320
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:26,170
we promise and yeah and so we use that

321
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,340
memory to boot into Linux the onboard

322
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,500
memory we tried to get it to work it's

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,540
not quite enough and there's just some

324
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:42,310
kind of gotchas to it there yeah there's

325
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,980
that's what it looks like and yeah from

326
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,580
the last implementation detail is

327
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,500
we used the light x SOC development

328
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,220
platform which is a pretty popular

329
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,240
environment for building SOC s if you

330
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,410
see Tim I'm sure he has like 5000 slides

331
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,790
on how that works

332
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,600
and so yeah special shout-out to Sean

333
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,160
Cross Hobbs for contributing with this

334
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:31,380
Tim Ansel me throw and yeah thanks we'll

335
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,550
call that Linux on the badge

336
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:45,330
next up Matt then and I added a and RGB

337
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:54,330
panel interface to this one again I got

338
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,030
the specs of the cartridge beforehand so

339
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,630
I was able to make this PCB I still got

340
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,220
one or two left so if anyone wants to

341
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,230
experiment with these panels they're

342
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,220
about 40 or $50 on others and and my

343
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,480
hack was convincing TNT to port his code

344
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,210
from ice 42 ECP 5 so now you can all and

345
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,980
access out so thanks very much tnt for

346
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,880
helping me with that IP LED panel on the

347
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,540
badge in rivera log hello my name is ben

348
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,820
hanky and this weekend i learned how to

349
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,820
hack FPGA is so I had a couple of these

350
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,860
NES controllers and if anybody's

351
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,140
familiar there's a basically a latch and

352
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,060
then you basically latch the state of

353
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,950
all the buttons then clock it out I

354
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,100
could do this in software but I hacked

355
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,880
an FPGA module to scan the controllers

356
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,620
let me fire that up real quick so I run

357
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,300
that through it'll scan all eight bits

358
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,140
and then runs out through a priority and

359
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,290
which will show one of the you know like

360
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,850
whatever button is the highest on the

361
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,650
priority there so all the different

362
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,299
eight buttons are kind of mapped out

363
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,210
works for the other one too there's four

364
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,990
ports total and let me load up another

365
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,760
from were so I ended up integrating this

366
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,850
into the SOC memory mapping these 32

367
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,700
bits for all four into memory and then

368
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,030
you can load invaders do I have a

369
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:40,960
volunteer to play alright so it takes

370
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,620
the second load

371
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:56,790
[Applause]

372
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,650
and Thank You sprite for the badge this

373
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,530
is amazing absolutely amazing next up

374
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,190
for a Mario Kart thank you very much

375
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,890
NES on the badge by NES controllers in

376
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,720
the badge

377
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,120
hello I'm Brett Wallach and for my badge

378
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,320
I decided to do some custom graphics and

379
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,840
add a heart rate monitor interface so

380
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm wearing a Bluetooth heart rate

381
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,120
monitor on my chest here and on the back

382
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,160
and on the cartridge port I added a

383
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,950
particle xenon it's running Bluetooth

384
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,200
central mode and it's taking the heart

385
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
rate information and it's putting it

386
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,260
into a spi slave implementation then on

387
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,600
the badge I'm accessing through a

388
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,590
software master SPI master interface

389
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,380
that I implemented and over there I was

390
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,510
like 90 BPM so right now I'm kind of

391
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,420
nervous onstage and I'm up to about 131

392
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,370
BPM right now

393
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:56,770
[Music]

394
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:02,230
[Applause]

395
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,480
bell jar a monitor

396
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,910
[Applause]

397
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,620
hey I'm Gil so I do it it was kind of

398
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,290
the previous category but also this one

399
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,080
because I mix the two babies at the feet

400
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,740
one and current one

401
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,710
so why I do that is because I wanted an

402
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,280
accelerometer and this has asn't and I

403
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,890
so I take the badge output to the serial

404
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,030
thanks to a guy who wrote PC P mode

405
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,870
module and I redirect as a serial of

406
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,280
this app to this up and so I can make a

407
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,080
batch mode when the thing is physics

408
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,270
calculated and it bounced on all the

409
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,530
side it means the name but I wasn't the

410
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,950
time and this is also a minigame when

411
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,020
you press and so it was a level one and

412
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,260
this is just a maze game when you just

413
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,300
like use the vector motor and if you

414
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,990
touch this like this it's game over and

415
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,480
you start again and it's like it's off

416
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,260
like it's Stan mode right now and it has

417
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,450
six levels and the difficult is

418
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,450
difficult

419
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,380
[Applause]

420
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,920
okay so that was what is that

421
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,809
accelerometer badge and a badge

422
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,780
it's exhibit school of badge hackery

423
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,190
line them up okay everyone we're gonna

424
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,840
need your applause okay everyone who

425
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,720
just gave us a come line back up take

426
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,510
your last bow onstage get yourself some

427
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,990
oh in the front of stage sorry maybe

428
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:12,850
here yeah first draft and see if you can

429
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,379
fool people into cheering for you

430
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,600
alright starting off we have Thomas with

431
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:39,580
Tetris on led matrix Chris and Co with I

432
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,310
our shark

433
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,569
[Applause]

434
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,910
Jacob Michael Drew etc Linux on badge

435
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,990
how we didn't get a name RGB panel for

436
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:07,890
the badge Matt Ben sorry Matt we got Ben

437
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,390
with NES controllers

438
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,680
we've got Brett with Bluetooth heart

439
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,850
raids and last but not least I'm sorry

440
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,389
what was your name again

441
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:39,140
sorry Guillaume with dual badge physics

442
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,850
mimicks is definitely number one we're

443
00:26:47,850 --> 00:27:06,360
the prize of okay we concur that shark

444
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,400
gets the next prize second place to

445
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,740
shark and third place duel prize duel

446
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,700
badge physics yo dawg i heard you like

447
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,940
badges alright thank you all very much

448
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,160
those were all amazing projects actually

449
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,470
especially given the difficulty level

450
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,310
I'm not gonna lie

451
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,890
alright coming up next is app hacks if

452
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,340
you wrote an application for the badge

453
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,480
file up over there on the side of the

454
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,510
stage and come on up if you got graphics

455
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,450
let me know we'll plug you into the HDMI

456
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,420
cable it's going to through the magical

457
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,100
wonders of technology show up on the

458
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,070
monitor over there that then is filmed

459
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,460
by another video camera that's right

460
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,380
because if we run it on the direct HDMI

461
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,120
here it shows up in the corner there is

462
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,060
a tiny little badge it's really

463
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,889
embarrassing this is a graphic tag yep

464
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,270
this is what's supposed to be on it but

465
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,860
it's actually gonna be in there

466
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,620
beautiful see Pross you my name is he

467
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,480
Pross you are you and are you are we

468
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,510
having quantum problems we are indeed no

469
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,980
I was right no you weren't

470
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,870
I was well it's not working so hold up

471
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:49,870
we might try pushing it in okay cool

472
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,450
cool cool cool good good all right so

473
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,100
who's old enough to remember this so I

474
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,230
want to personally thank the person who

475
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,570
actually brought a copy of after-dark

476
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,929
version 2.0 for Windows I saw that and I

477
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,160
knew that we had to do something with it

478
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,820
so first thing I did was you know floppy

479
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,059
drive get it loaded get a Windows three

480
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,010
one one VM loaded in VirtualBox because

481
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,290
why not and that was like well we need

482
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,690
get this in so I took the hand cat app

483
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,740
and started messing with the PNG and

484
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,590
you'll notice the how it's a little off

485
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,270
I didn't quite realize it the first few

486
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,860
times I compiled it and it came up

487
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,419
completely wrong but we got it in the

488
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:35,059
end so that's pretty much it got flying

489
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:44,179
toasters awesome that was flying

490
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,900
toasters next up just in a Nick with

491
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,929
airdrop airdrop IR so what we did we did

492
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,010
two things

493
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,960
both with irda so we got the IRDA

494
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,750
working on the badge and added a you are

495
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,730
driver for that had to add some very log

496
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,250
but ultimately we set up file transfer

497
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,700
on the badge so the problem we found in

498
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,470
the IR was that when we transmitted with

499
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,330
one it's completely swapped its own

500
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,730
receiver and so we had to add some some

501
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,590
latching and the in the very log but

502
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,419
keep that from happening so we're gonna

503
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:22,130
do a little file transfer here so it

504
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,850
takes this gonna take about 10 seconds

505
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,020
so it'll take about 10 seconds to

506
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,880
receive the file this is like a 100

507
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,330
kilobyte file at 115 - over IR and then

508
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,530
it'll display the picture so

509
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:41,870
[Music]

510
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,690
[Applause]

511
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,559
we had some trouble getting other

512
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,419
peonies to work but we got that one to

513
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,620
work so then we have one more demo for I

514
00:30:49,620 --> 00:31:01,470
are so cool so Nick's gonna play flappy

515
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:08,880
bird here going oh I thought Nick was

516
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,640
gonna play Pappy bird but okay I'll

517
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,450
press a button we start sorry we got

518
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:15,870
bugs

519
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,309
that's it bugs alright so yeah I'm not

520
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,200
very good at flappy birds but basically

521
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,669
what we did was we made this a

522
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,130
controller for flappy birds and so I can

523
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,620
play flappy birds on my badge but it's

524
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,669
actually playing on here then we also

525
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:43,110
did Tetris so that's it drop IR air drop

526
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:53,429
ir victor and since this is a conference

527
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,740
and we do presentations i thought i'd

528
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:05,640
bring a little PowerPoint there we go

529
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,320
there's Clippy so as you know when you

530
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,330
plug this into your computer it shows up

531
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,990
as a remote drive so I put a couple

532
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,230
powerpoints on there so this is the

533
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,780
badge that sprite TM gave here's a

534
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,820
little instruction left and right left

535
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,580
goes back right goes forward B is to get

536
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,020
back to the menu so here it is welcome

537
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,049
to a kadai Super Kong 2019 this is the

538
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,740
conference badge it has an FPGA it's a

539
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,640
45 K Lutz which is a lookup table it's

540
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,200
in the Gameboy shape form factor

541
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,650
open-source tool chain here's the what

542
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,470
it contained there's an e CP 5 16 Meg's

543
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,289
of RAM 16 Meg's of Flash there's

544
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,870
cartridge add-on oh yeah and there's no

545
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,559
headphone port

546
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,429
because that's the cool thing it's

547
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:01,769
configured with to Rick's risk five

548
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,200
cores a pic sixteen graphics pipeline

549
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,559
DFU loader here's the like block diagram

550
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,999
you got the power going to the FPGA

551
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:12,899
which then goes to everything else you

552
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:17,009
got the SAO 1.6 Extreme Edition which

553
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,409
has an extra GPIO and the DRM pins and

554
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,179
if it's not above then it is a feature

555
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,210
so a couple features you got now are the

556
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,940
P mod silkscreens reversed and the SAO

557
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,240
silkscreens also reversed there's the

558
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,649
board revision so it's a good idea to

559
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,090
have different colors so you start with

560
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,190
red which was the early days then the

561
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,019
blue and everybody else has the black

562
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,590
ones oh and here's the the badge hacking

563
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,179
so you can go like see to the health

564
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,850
programs which is the application can do

565
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,990
hardware hacking bitstreams and thank

566
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,200
you

567
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:07,839
PowerPoint PowerPoint naturally hi I'm

568
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,399
Adam Zulu from graphics for this one

569
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,510
while he's getting that plugged in if

570
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,829
you were at my thermodynamics talked

571
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,119
earlier you probably recognize this one

572
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,579
thank you I thought it was kind of

573
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:24,250
annoying that I needed I needed to be up

574
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,899
my computer if I wanted to simulate heat

575
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,389
transfer through anything so I figured a

576
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,500
badge would be a great way to do that

577
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,918
it's a full computer after all so right

578
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,260
now it's solving partial differential

579
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,849
equations with a central difference

580
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,699
approximation which is a fancy way to

581
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,799
say it's doing algebra it's actually not

582
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:43,779
that complicated but then now it's

583
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,250
actually displaying it and what it's

584
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,679
displaying is the temperature profile of

585
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,750
an aluminum plate where the top and the

586
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,309
left side are held at 100 degrees

587
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:53,168
Celsius and then the bottom and right

588
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,730
side are held at 0 degrees Celsius and

589
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,230
this is after like a minute or two of

590
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,119
heat transferring through it basically

591
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,630
takes a little while to display but good

592
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,109
there it is

593
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,419
[Applause]

594
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,440
right so my name is Caroline and I have

595
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,499
graphics I just thought that the I

596
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,089
didn't know seat before this weekend so

597
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,469
I couldn't get very far but I just

598
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,359
changed the color palette to make a

599
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:43,099
color scrambler so if I hold down you

600
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,950
can see how the transparency changes and

601
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,479
you can see like stop at different

602
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,009
colors to see how it affects it and it

603
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:51,619
goes really faster than you can think so

604
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,910
it's really a gamble every time so if

605
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,289
you want a gamble no one spend any money

606
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:07,160
here's the free way to do it palette

607
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:18,289
demo yeah sure sure it won't work if

608
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:21,799
it's off hello humans and cyborgs my

609
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:25,309
name is Zack Friedman and about just

610
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:28,219
showing you my project so how many folks

611
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,660
have run like embedded Linux or

612
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,039
something on your project probably

613
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,099
everybody the best most satisfying part

614
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,920
is when you finally get the circuit

615
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,719
working you load up your serial port and

616
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,479
you get to see it booting up and the

617
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,999
problem with this is that eventually it

618
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:48,440
finishes booting so I have created a

619
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,719
boot screen that never ends featuring

620
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,509
200 verbs and a hundred nouns it will

621
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:56,779
plan --is-- turkeys eject D class and

622
00:36:56,779 --> 00:37:00,969
synthesize jambalaya all day

623
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:07,800
it's it's not a bootloader it's the boot

624
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:27,120
Lotus thank you next up yeah come on

625
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,710
come on everybody wants to see it it's

626
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,500
people so uh my name's ask or Amelia I

627
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,390
made the Internet of batteries and for

628
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,840
our well I didn't know there was a where

629
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,940
this would apply so I wrote a continuous

630
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,130
integration agent in PowerShell for our

631
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,810
badge so what you can do is have a well

632
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,980
hold on I got again the right directory

633
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,870
first yeah can we get a video on this so

634
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,320
whenever you change the make that C file

635
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,820
the PowerShell script notices the last

636
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,610
right time of that file compares it to

637
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,160
what it last saw and if it's changed it

638
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,980
will just execute a make and in this I'm

639
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,830
actually using a configuration file so

640
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,780
you can set wherever your apps are and

641
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,610
what drive the initial amount as and

642
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,650
then just run the app integration agent

643
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,420
here and it will attempt to upload any

644
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,180
changed applications so it actually is

645
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,380
having trouble with a that's just a

646
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,490
location error so right now it's

647
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,570
actually just taking forever to upload

648
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,220
doom because that one takes forever to

649
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,970
upload so right now what we're doing is

650
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,100
waiting for changes on files so I can

651
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,320
actually jump over to the main dot C for

652
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,700
say nyan cat and just add enter and save

653
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,770
it and then over here my integration

661
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:02,170
continuous integration for the badge yep

662
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,410
that's awesome all right everyone are we

663
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,599

674
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,670
autocorrect here we got Justin and Nick

never-ending boot screen ask or Amelia

682
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,180
with continuous integration for badges

683
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,280
that was a strong favorite for

684
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
never-ending boot screen okie Dokes i

685
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,730
you did it

686
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,520
there's a hundred bucks for him what do

687
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,390
you think for second and third a score

688
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,420
Amelia did super well and I think air

689
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,360
drop by our was probably those I think

690
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,700
those are the two next so I don't know

691
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,250
order I don't think I can judge but air

692
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,350
drop IR and continuous integration

693
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,000

good this was a collaboration between

705
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,940
Roger Chang and I Roger proposed late

706
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,840
one night to do a TI thx thing and he

707
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,530
was like here's our here's our line our

708
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,050
line is gonna be the audience is hacking

709
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,300
and I was like all dude that's so good

710
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:34,410
we're doing it and thus deep a horrible

711
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,210
mic stand

712
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:42,080
deep deep not ladies gentleman deep not

713
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,000
[Music]

714
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,099
Elliott Williams had Roger Chang

715
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:15,869
everyone graphics by Roger sound by me

716
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,569
so hi I'm Ben unwired bin and when I'm

717
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,579
presenting I gotta call super calm mood

718
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:26,829
I was really inspired by all the great

719
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:28,329
interstitial so we've had up before

720
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:32,769
displays so no sound but I can make my

721
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:36,609
own sounds if I need to so what you have

722
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:45,130
here so production here we got a the

723
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,049
background is spatially scanned off the

724
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:48,250
back they gave us at the beginning of

725
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,720
the conference took a picture of it

726
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,490
individually colored all the different

727
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,289
things in different colors and so that's

728
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,029
palette cycling and then we have the

729
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:56,500
sprites going for the arrows on the

730
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,299
sides I try to do four but then it make

731
00:43:58,299 --> 00:43:59,829
the background disappear so if there are

732
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:01,210
some features on the badge

733
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:10,450
thank you very much alright that's a

734
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:15,519
super con parody super GaN send up

735
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,359
thanks very much

736
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:20,650
anyone else graphics sound audio I can't

737
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,430
take the prize all right let's listen

738
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,970
yeah we should okay ready well let's

739
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,369
have applause for wired Ben one two

740
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,610
three

741
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,640
[Applause]

742
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,109
all right at the moment you've all been

743
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,929
waiting for best Hardware hacks

744
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,279
whoever's soldered anything onto the

745
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:47,009
badge mess with the cartridge etc etc

746
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:49,769
please come on up and show us your

747
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:54,809
hardware hacks we probably need a camera

748
00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:00,419
for this one come on up hi there I'm Tim

749
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,669
trumpets otherwise known as Timman and I

750
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:04,529
didn't actually solder anything I made a

751
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:08,400
badge enclosure this as a working keypad

752
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,609
and d-pad and power switch toggle that

753
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,929
sometimes works because the switch is

754
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,709
terrible it has recessed ports so you

755
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:18,589
can actually plug them in theoretically

756
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:21,539
including the other HDMI and USB port on

757
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:24,509
it the earlier versions of the thing had

758
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:26,729
trouble fitting the batteries in so I

759
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:28,709
went and I redid it and so now it has a

760
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,630
little engine compartments on it for the

761
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,489
for the batteries and so this is what I

762
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:35,159
called the 3 cheeks version it's also

763
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:37,589
got a a cartridge port this does not fit

764
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:39,449
the cartridge that you got because I

765
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:40,469
didn't actually have it because I

766
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,439
started on this last week as soon as the

767
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:44,909
files went up on github I was

768
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,969
immediately reconstructing the badge 3d

769
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:49,619
model trying to get all the components I

770
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,239
tried to as best I could the guesses

771
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,589
which components went on there I wasn't

772
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:53,640
quite right that's why this one didn't

773
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,579
work and so I designed the cartridge

774
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:58,679
separately but you can chop your

775
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,150
cartridge down to fit in this thing and

776
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,219
it does snap nicely into the back of the

777
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:13,919
thing what I'm not on stage so there is

778
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:16,019
the the wonderful enclosure with the

779
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:17,159
cartridge even has a little friction

780
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,839
thing there and a belt clip very

781
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,249
important because it is a badge they're

782
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:21,599
supposed to wear it and the there's no

783
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,919
plate I couldn't get the hole through it

784
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:26,130
anymore so and you know all the ports

785
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,130
access the d-pad and oh yes there are

786
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,779
printable light pipes for this but it

787
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:32,130
turns out if you put a light pipe on it

788
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,299
you can't actually tell what the LEDs

789
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:34,859
are lit so I just left them out on this

790
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,839
one here oh yes and there's a hole for

791
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,029
the speaker so you can actually hear the

792
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:44,579
sounds so so this has been the badge

793
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,169
enclosure the purple badge enclosure

794
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,089
[Applause]

795
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:04,079
I'm Emily Velasco and this is Melissa

796
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,890
and I'm Melissa LeBlanc Williams and we

797
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,739
both made our badges really loud so and

798
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:31,950
and mine is like extra annoying I gave

799
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:36,509
it modular input to the amplifier so you

800
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:40,850
can swap by just unplugging a jack here

801
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,279
[Music]

802
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:46,469
then if I plug it into this other source

803
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:48,690
which could be anything if you guys saw

804
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,430
the big grumpy cat badge we had that

805
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,369
hooked up for a while this weekend and

806
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,089
is it gonna work

807
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:58,589
yes so now it's taking a PWM signal from

808
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,839
a flickering LED and feeding that into

809
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,640
the amplifier so I have two ways to be

810
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,710
really annoying now

811
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,789
[Music]

812
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,880
[Applause]

813
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:23,710
loud badges oh hi my name is Alex Camilo

814
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,619
and I created a module that adds an ESB

815
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:28,510
32 to the Piedmont connector and I

816
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,359
modified the FPGA to add a third serial

817
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,250
port and then I ran it to power problems

818
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,529
where the ESP would try to calibrate its

819
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:38,260
radio and reset the badge so I tried to

820
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,299
turn the five volt rail into a 3.3 volt

821
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:41,500
rail but it was still resetting the

822
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,299
badge so I finally gave up and soldered

823
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,329
on a wire - directly to the battery and

824
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:46,990
it works now

825
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,200
so can I also have HDMI absolutely

826
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,730
it's connecting to the Internet and

827
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,370
loading a web page

828
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,529
[Applause]

829
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:29,109
Internet of badges hi my name is Ben

830
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:31,509
Lancaster and I actually worked on this

831
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:34,690
with Alan Greene who had to leave before

832
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,349
this event I believe so he's not here

833
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:40,960
I actually worked on two things I added

834
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,880
an ESP 32 to the badge and my goal was

835
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,569
to talk to this little robot I built at

836
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,289
the badge so this badge has an ESP 32

837
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:56,529
cam on it which transmits video over

838
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:59,680
Wi-Fi to the ESP 32 on the back of this

839
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,670
badge and you can drive it like fpv

840
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,390
Mario Kart and yeah we got little

841
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,299
infrared driving controls here if you

842
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,450
want to do infrared from the flying

843
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,559
shark library and we also have some

844
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,569
emitters here you can use to launch

845
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:22,539
weapons and stuff so we're hoping to do

846
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:26,219
fpv Mario Kart in the future

847
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:32,859
fantastic fpv Mario Kart I guess right

848
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:36,609
alright bring it up do we have power for

849
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:45,369
this somewhere okay so I wasn't really

850
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:46,809
planning on doing anything when I got

851
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:50,499
here but on Friday night before up until

852
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:53,289
they kicked us out of HQ I was digging

853
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:55,269
into the fpga code so look at the video

854
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:58,239
because i'm a video guy and I say my

855
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,279
name my name is Steve cool of I do retro

856
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:03,819
video game stuff and so from looking at

857
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:07,210
that I noticed that the core had a VGA

858
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:12,940
module which then feeds a something that

859
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,559
translates into the digital video then

860
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,539
it goes to HDMI and so I thought we

861
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:18,759
could make a VGA output for this and we

862
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:21,910
did by just tapping the lines to that

863
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,309
would normally go to the HDMI and then

864
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,349
bring it out to the i/o on the expansion

865
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:30,819
port and so we made a DAC digital analog

866
00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:31,990
converter

867
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,060
out of resistors called a binary

868
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,660
weighted deck and I didn't remember the

869
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,880
formula so I read or derived it and then

870
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,890
I simulated it in spice because if

871
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,410
anybody here knows me I am a big spice

872
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,990
nerd I simulate everything and then

873
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,630
luckily the digi-key had parts that were

874
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,500
close enough and so there's 24 big

875
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,020
resistors because it's 8 bits for each

876
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,680
color times 324 plus 2 protection

877
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,540
resistors for HIV sync and then some

878
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,040
power protection circuitry because

879
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,400
there's a 5 volt line and you don't want

880
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,550
it to back feed so yeah I wasn't

881
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,680
planning on doing any hacking on the veg

882
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,580
but I just got so into like looking into

883
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,400
the how the video worked that this is

884
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,040
like a simple project I think VGA if

885
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,560
you're going into video learn how to

886
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,680
make a VGA controller and the interface

887
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,740
and you'll learn a lot and so it's it's

888
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,720
one thing I like to teach a lot and when

889
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,089
I do demos workshops so if you notice

890
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:44,650
the video outputs a little cleaner

891
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,589
because well one that HDMI cord is like

892
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:52,780
what 50 feets I think and so yeah it's

893
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,180
not like true HDMI I could get into that

894
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,500
later you want to talk about video talk

895
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,210
to me later but yeah so we got the VGA I

896
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,760
went I went to a goodwill next door I

897
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,410
needed something to display a VGA

898
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:10,589
because you know

899
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:15,760
I was hoping they'd have a CRT monitor

900
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,080
because that would fit the aesthetic of

901
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,820
the badge yeah you know because it's

902
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,950
like a retro style I talk too much here

903
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,290
you go awesome thank you very much

904
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:35,200
VGA on the badge yeah my name is Ian I

905
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
got tired of running out of batteries

906
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,580
after I went through two sets on the

907
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,880
first day getting into badge hacking so

908
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,720
I tried as neatly as possible to

909
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,660
eliminate the need for them using a

910
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,060
little USB power that port on my

911
00:53:53,060 --> 00:54:00,070
computer is actually broken but if we

912
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,700
you should be able to boot without

913
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,240
needing there we go without needing any

914
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,959
batteries in it

915
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,630
[Applause]

916
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,509
so we can run all our favorite apps mess

917
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:25,529
with all the LEDs that was a part of the

918
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,220
project

919
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,930
big thanks to Jaron Jaron have Bell

920
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,549
he'll not happen now it's your name

921
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:35,759
sorry for for London for landing giving

922
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:37,979
me this I'm taking it because I would

923
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:40,160
not been able to do it without him

924
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:51,779
yeah thanks USB power on the badge hi

925
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:55,589
I'm Gary mace and I just wanted to get

926
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:59,029
an LED to blink

927
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,029
so I struggle through through the tool

928
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:05,369
chain and got that working but I didn't

929
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:13,880
see digi-key had smaller LEDs so so

930
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:25,930
you should all look that way thank you

931
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:32,030
[Applause]

932
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,810
how many peas cells in that battery pack

933
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:38,480
eight D cells ladies and gentlemen and

934
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,570
taped together with digi-key rulers hi

935
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:45,860
there my name is Nikki and I made

936
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,450
another badge case this one is orange it

937
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,940
also follows the lines of the badge much

938
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,340
more closely but it also makes available

939
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,220
all of the connectors the IRDA the P mod

940
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:03,080
the shitty add-ons even wall even the

941
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,300
cartridge slot fits with the provided

942
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,280
cartridge provided that your surface

943
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,500
mount or through whole legs orange

944
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,920
too-tall

945
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:19,670
[Applause]

946
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:25,170
thank you orange badge case it's not

947
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,040
Fitz - alright everyone if you could

948
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,050
line up here in front of the stage it's

949
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:36,210
time for judging again I have to say

950
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:40,020
these are all fantastic hacks I had do

951
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,180
we want to get rid of the 2 extra tin DS

952
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,740
from oh you have an idea okay good

953
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,770
mike has an idea I just realize that I

954
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,600
missed an important part of a USB power

955
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,090
it's wired particularly so it won't blow

956
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:57,500
up your batteries or your computer

957
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,920
details details

958
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,990
all right starting off we've got Tim

959
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:11,670
with purple badge and closure next up

960
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,680
Emily and Melissa with really loud

961
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:24,690
latches plus amps whap Alex with ESP 32p

962
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,130
mod 2 internet browser

963
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:38,690
been an Allen ESP 32 fpg fpv robot link

964
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,730
[Applause]

965
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:53,230
and ruin steve with vga output in USB

966
00:57:53,230 --> 00:58:01,150
powered badge garrett blinking an LED

967
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:25,390
and nick with orange badge case alright

968
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,369
i'm what do you think i think it was

969
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:29,410
internet was first I think Internet of

970
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,590
badges takes the big prize

971
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,780
[Applause]

972
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:45,940
followed by blinking an LED and VGA

973
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,270
output

974
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,099
it's the simple things ladies and

975
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:53,460
gentlemen

976
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,349
do it we want to have two special

977
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:10,670
honorable mentions because we have two

978
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,170
extra tindy gift certificates we're

979
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,529
gonna give one out to Carolyn for the

980
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:19,009
for the first week of C ever in her life

981
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:21,290
and the palette hacked

982
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:30,419
[Applause]

983
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,140
and the other four flying toasters

984
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,730
[Applause]

985
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,850
[Music]

986
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:43,369
[Applause]

987
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:45,420
sprite you want to come up this stage

988
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:55,259
real quick a quick round of applause one

989
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,729
more time for the man who designed our

990
00:59:56,729 --> 01:00:02,720
badge sprite TM thank you thank you

991
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,619
thank you so much um I have nothing

992
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:09,930
planned but I'm actually curious you

993
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:13,259
guys know that there was a heck of meter

994
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:14,849
on the batch right

995
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,190
the trick was if you lit all the LEDs

996
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,999
then you're really lit and an ultimate

997
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:23,940
record name your name your name

998
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,950
can I see some fingers who actually

999
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,140
managed to turn on all the LEDs on the

1000
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,499
echo meter oh that's that's not that

1001
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:33,450
many but there's a fair bit one two

1002
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,190
three four

1003
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:37,259
yeah sorry you guys it's kinda hard to

1004
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:43,460
see with all these lights yeah okay yeah

1005
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,999
yeah I think so

1006
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:48,960
um second question who figured out that

1007
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,609
the LEDs actually were RGB LEDs that's

1008
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,380
not that many okay

1009
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,930
so so so they are for the people who

1010
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:01,109
didn't your take home exercises to light

1011
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:06,059
the badge LEDs in all colors anyway um

1012
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,249
yeah I'm up here now I don't have that

1013
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,950
much more to say I would like to thank

1014
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,989
you very much I I really enjoyed all the

1015
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:14,309
things that people did with hacking

1016
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:16,979
there were things that I didn't imagine

1017
01:01:16,979 --> 01:01:19,739
I mean people putting an age putting a

1018
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:22,289
VGA cable onto a badge with a perfectly

1019
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:24,859
good flow

1020
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,300
anyway the other thing was the the the

1021
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,100
IRDA thing so the thing is that IRDA

1022
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,870
transceivers usually come specifically

1023
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,660
stated that they support Cir which is

1024
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,880
the 38 kilohertz standard the datasheet

1025
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,570
for this

1026
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,970
transceiver didn't specifically state it

1027
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,730
so my guess is that the transceiver

1028
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,620
couldn't actually do that but this group

1029
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,300
didn't know that so they implemented it

1030
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,710
anyway and it worked so anyway thank you

1031
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,660
very much for all that you did on the

1032
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,060
batch it has been great developing it it

1033
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,610
has been great seeing what you guys all

1034
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,250
did with it just from the questions that

1035
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,670
I got really showed me that there were

1036
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,320
people working on it and really

1037
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,850
enthusiastically and passionately

1038
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,010
hacking on that and for that I'd like to

1039
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,150
thank you

1040
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:28,219
[Applause]

1041
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,880
all right so uh thank you so much for

1042
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,589
coming to batch hacking we are gonna put

1043
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:34,420
up a slide deck for closing ceremonies

1044
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:38,219
and we'll be with you in two minutes
