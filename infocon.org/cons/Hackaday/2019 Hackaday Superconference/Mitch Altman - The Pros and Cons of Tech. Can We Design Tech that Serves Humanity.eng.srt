known for creating the tv-b-gone remote

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,710
control which is a keychain that can

7
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,010

way that I can I'll start my timer this

20
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,970
talk is about technology and all of us

21
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,630
are into technology I've been a geek

22
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,340
really all my life I've been playing

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,260
with this stuff as a little kid and over

24
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,480
time I got good enough to help small

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,329
companies with their problems doing

26
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,700
consulting for like 15 years of my adult

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,950
life and I did a bunch of things which I

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,900
thought were pretty cool like I'm one of

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,910
the people who helped develop virtual

30
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,470
reality we claim the term even the work

31
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,040
that I did led to the power glove for

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,650
instance and you know after working for

33
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,620
a whole bunch of companies I had the

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,329
dumb idea of starting my own company and

35
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,459
I figured I couldn't make the same

36
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,900
stupid mistakes that all those other

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,209
companies make and run my own company in

38
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,860
the ground but surprise it actually was

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,650
successful I wrote the firmware I

40
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,140
usually do hardware and the person who

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,500
usually does firmware my friend did the

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,260
hardware and that was my first taste of

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,510
FPGAs the firmware is still available on

44
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,739
the 2019 version from Broadcom which is

45
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,829
kind of crazy that my 1997 firmware is

46
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,540
still being used but the the work that I

47
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,100
did even though it was a lot of cool

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,860
stuff it wasn't super meaningful for me

49
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,390
personally

50
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,790
and I actually quit doing all of that

51
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,560
after 15 years so that I could do

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,640
something that I thought was more

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
meaningful and for me that was tv-b-gone

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,380
this keychain that turns TV's off in

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,380
public places and it was meaningful for

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,980
me because after really half of the

57
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,510
first half of my life being totally

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,459
depressed trying to escape into a

59
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,130
television I really wanted to turn them

60
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,700
off in public places so I did and made

61
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,989
it available for other people and I've

62
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,670
been making a living with 12 friends on

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,680
this for the last 16 years kind of

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,640
amazing I've now been mostly doing open

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,769
hardware Oh TV Gon's open source of

66
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,450
course everything I do is I've been

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,330
doing open hardware kits so that other

68
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,930
people can learn this stuff and go on to

69
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,209
do whatever they do I also started

70
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,760
Noisebridge and early hackerspace in San

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,670
Francisco that can teach all sorts of

72
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,680
different tech to people not just what

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,269
we think of like high tech electronics

74
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,668
but art and crafts and whatever we do at

75
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,979
hackerspaces how many people here have

76
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,190
ever been to a hackerspace almost

77
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,950
everybody that's awesome so yeah and

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,960
like doing Noisebridge start helping

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,270
start Noisebridge

80
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,060
inadvertently started on a hackerspace

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,160
movement along with the help of zillions

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,479
of other people around the world and now

83
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,880
there's thousands starting from 40 way

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,789
long ago but doing tv-b-gone got me

85
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,620
internet famous and I got invited to

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,430
give lots and lots of talks and so all

87
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,780
over the world I've been giving talks

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,510
and whenever I give a talk they might

89
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,250
pay me something and I'll just do a

90
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,010
workshop for free for a hackerspace or

91
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,479
people wanting to start a hackerspace

92
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,030
and it seemed to get the energy going

93
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,490
and it felt good to help people do that

94
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,990
so I kept doing that and I've been doing

95
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,880
workshop tours all around the world and

96
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,889
that's just sort of a background about

97
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,410
me to give you a sense of where I'm

98
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,169
coming from here we have a long history

99
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,720
on our planet as people about three

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,370
hundred thousand years depending on how

101
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,530
you define people and over that amount

102
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,010
of time we've learned a lot and we've

103
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,410
forgotten a lot too but we've

104
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,320
gained a lot of wisdom along the way all

105
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,080
sorts of wisdom that is still really

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,480
good today but over time a lot of it

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,280
just even if it is good wisdom people

108
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,440
kind of just look at the words they

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,910
don't really look at the meaning anymore

110
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,790
and a lot of that wisdom is not

111
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,890
necessarily stuff that's worthwhile

112
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,920
after 300,000 years a lot of it has

113
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,280
become merely conventional we can learn

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,110
a lot from the experience of others and

115
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,910
we should and I'm going to be sharing

116
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,040
some experiences of mine things I've

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,800
thought about a lot but we really need

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
to come up with our own way of thinking

119
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,390
of things if we're going to do things in

120
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,820
a way that allows each of us to live a

121
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,950
life we think is awesome way worth

122
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,830
living we definitely need some new

123
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,160
wisdom a lot of that wisdom is really

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,710
cool but a lot of the the wisdom from

125
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,250
before has brought us to some really

126
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,380
serious problems

127
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,860
oh yeah and as I go along I'm gonna be

128
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,760
talking about stuff that I've thought

129
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,830
about a lot that doesn't mean I'm right

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,540
and it doesn't mean you have to agree

131
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,030
with me either but hopefully it'll allow

132
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,310
you to think about some things maybe in

133
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,640
new ways that will be helpful for you

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,200
and I'll try to do it in a nice way so

135
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,470
but many of the what we call

136
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,300
conventional wisdom has brought us to

137
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,970
some serious problems that are facing us

138
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,940
now that we need to solve quickly the

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,520
planet may no longer be able to support

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,860
mammals and other creatures within five

141
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,110
years a lot of people are saying with

142
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,430
along with that there's more and more

143
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,970
disease we're totally messing up the air

144
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,040
and water on our planet there's way less

145
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,910
lack of good drinking water which a lot

146
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,330
of people need to live there's soon

147
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,480
there's going to be 98 percent of the

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,830
power of the wealth owned by 0.1% of the

149
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,770
population if things keep going this way

150
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,720
and it seems like they will there's less

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,490
and less jobs which means people don't

152
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,410
have money for food and shelter this

153
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,810
makes people hungry and angry and that

154
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,870
leads to very very very unstable social

155
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,330
situations and with nuclear threat over

156
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,520
us a war is not exact

157
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,099
what any of us really want to see we

158
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,550
definitely need new wisdom in order to

159
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,190
bring us forward into any future at all

160
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,650
let alone a good future which I really

161
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,909
really would like to see for all of us

162
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,490
technology is this is what we usually

163
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,319
think of when we think of technology but

164
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,629
it's just tools you know it's like we

165
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,699
started off with simple technology way

166
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,520
long ago and we with that technology we

167
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,500
learn a lot and we share it and we we

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,659
can make more complex technology and

169
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,639
based on that technology we know so much

170
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,349
more we can even make more technical

171
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,590
technology that's even more complex and

172
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,169
more powerful as time goes on it goes up

173
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,210
exponentially the technology we're able

174
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,849
to do now is just amazing and just this

175
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,979
badge that we have now unlike someone

176
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,339
like me who hasn't done FPGAs since 1997

177
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,719
can actually come in and do something

178
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,958
really cool in a two hour workshop

179
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,350
pretty amazing and so I'm gonna be

180
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,170
asking some questions throughout my talk

181
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,260
just things to ponder about my first

182
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,180
question is does technology change the

183
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,420
world the questions I'm asking don't

184
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,890
have right and wrong answers but this

185
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,529
one actually does of course technology

186
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,339
changes the world

187
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,380
everything we do changes the world for

188
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,250
good for bad powerful ways little ways

189
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,899
technology changes the world in many

190
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,089
many ways some really cool some not so

191
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:15,850
cool we can use technology to make music

192
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,040
that might be good or bad depending on

193
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,079
your point of view but it can also make

194
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,270
the world an incredibly horrible place

195
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,070
by causing so many of these problems

196
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,709
that I already showed you about these

197
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,020
are all caused by technology here's

198
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,060
another question can we create new tech

199
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,209
to solve all of these problems that the

200
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:48,490
old tech created can we well maybe but

201
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,620
the thing is the new tech is even more

202
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,940
powerful and it needs to be more

203
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,490
powerful to cut to solve these problems

204
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,930
that were solved by the old tech that

205
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,620
had undesirable effects

206
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,080
we didn't even think of and so the

207
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,820
technology that we'll need to solve

208
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,010
those problems are going to create all

209
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,560
sorts of interesting artifacts that

210
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,720
weren't expected and we'll need even

211
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,760
more powerful technology to solve them

212
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,770
and this goes around and around and I

213
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,980
don't think that ends - well necessarily

214
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,850
yet we need to try it's how we got but

215
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,040
we need to do it in certain ways and to

216
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,540
do that I'm going to show you just some

217
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,390
context for this so way back at the

218
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,920
beginning of our species you know like

219
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
300 thousand years ago or so we weren't

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,450
big and strong like these critters we

221
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,300
however have big brains we're not really

222
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,680
strong but we get together with big

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,210
brains and together we can support

224
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,580
ourselves to survive and is sometimes

225
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,110
not our hostile environment and because

226
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,150
we survive the need for that kind of

227
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,100
community to support each other survived

228
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,230
with us and even though we don't feel

229
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,420
like we need community just to merely

230
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,120
survive we still have this deep inner

231
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
need within us and we still need it to

232
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,410
feel good about living our lives to feel

233
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,910
part of something bigger than ourselves

234
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,910
is super super important and that's why

235
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,220
we're all here at the super conference

236
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,900
and many of the other communities we

237
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,710
create in our lives we need community

238
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,980
and we need community I think to survive

239
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,570
now because I think it's the only way

240
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,040
that we're going to be able to come

241
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
together and support each other there's

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,330
solve these massive problems facing us

243
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,370
in this very short amount of time that

244
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,410
we have to solve them but we need

245
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,810
community so we're looking for it on our

246
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,120
planet within our planet as very little

247
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,980
of this community in our modern world

248
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,420
we're all so busy we have so many

249
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,860
obligations we have all these pressures

250
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,200
facing us all these stresses we look for

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,510
it wherever we can if a family is doing

252
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,550
its best it can be an incredible

253
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,370
community but for many of us it's like

254
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,430
this or worse places of worship at their

255
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,740
best can be amazing communities at their

256
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,590
worst that are incredibly awful

257
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,390
school at their best can be amazing we

258
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,040
can come together and learn so much

259
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,020
quite often though it just makes people

260
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,640
compete

261
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,060
eat and be alone and isolated taking a

262
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,550
test which is totally meaningless we try

263
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,290
to get it it works some places at work

264
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,510
seem pretty cool but some glazes at work

265
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,500
look not so cool we try to find it on TV

266
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,720
which promises us to show us the world

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,700
and bring us all together and yet it's

268
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,650
just a whole bunch of individuals being

269
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,660
alienated watching a screen at the same

270
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,310
time being lonely putting people into a

271
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,130
state where we can easily be manipulated

272
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,520
to buy we don't even want or need

273
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,370
it's fantastic for that and now we have

274
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,300
the Internet

275
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,880
which is of course so much better at

276
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,190
manipulating people into buying we

277
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,900
don't want or need and making people

278
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,020
isolated and alienated and making people

279
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,840
very easily manipulated into fighting

280
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,310
one another over things that don't even

281
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,080
matter because we have so much more in

282
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,640
common than we have all these minor

283
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,200
differences that people are destroying

284
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,560
this sells ourselves over and destroying

285
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,500
our democracy and governments of all

286
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,630
sorts all of this happens because all of

287
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,330
these technologies are within a context

288
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,810
a cultural context within which these

289
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,060
technologies are released into and those

290
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,540
contexts aren't encouraging us to use

291
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,790
these technologies in ways that benefit

292
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,440
all of us however we can create more

293
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,290
positive contexts like at hacker

294
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,120
conferences like this one or like this

295
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,480
one in Brazil where I was at giving a

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,690
talk about a year ago this is all

297
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,330
through hacking and all of you probably

298
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,860
have your own definition of hacking it

299
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,500
probably overlaps mine but hacking to me

300
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,900
is a way of looking at things we see the

301
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,000
world is full of resources everything is

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,010
a resource that we can use to improve

303
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,050
our projects any way that we want to

304
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,090
these resources are all available if we

305
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,040
can use them any way we want to improve

306
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,840
our projects we see what works what

307
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,130
doesn't we share them with other people

308
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,620
and that's what hacking is all about and

309
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,080
that's what it was called in 1953 and

310
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,330
MIT before computers even existed and

311
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,520
this is an incredibly enjoyable process

312
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,959
and it's a way of looking at things a

313
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,510
way of being and it really really helps

314
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,880
all of us and this is something we can

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,149
do so much better in community to create

316
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,050
a positive context for doing all sorts

317
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,930
of amazing things some amazing things

318
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,000
that we've been seeing here and the

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,589
hackaday prize and just out on that

320
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:45,330
hacking table over there over the last

321
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,120
two days of course anything can be

322
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,870
hacked it's not limited to just

323
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,070
electronics although of course we can

324
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,200
and computers it's a lot of fun but can

325
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,149
also do art and crafts and ourselves

326
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,089
science ourselves are living lifelong

327
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,220
projects that need improvement our

328
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,050
communities need improvement we can hack

329
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,580
on our communities we can keep making

330
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,430
them stronger and more supportive the

331
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,220
planet needs improvement for sure and

332
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,260
needs to be hacked and if we don't do it

333
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,110
who is going to it's up to us to do that

334
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,700
everything can and should be hacked and

335
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,959
we can do that so much better in

336
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,750
community and when we do that we can

337
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,880
hack tools we can start from simple

338
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
things use simple things in powerful

339
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,380
ways we can do that and we do this in

340
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,089
community the main thing is coming

341
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,970
together in community and once we're in

342
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,070
community we see what the people want to

343
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,050
do what each member wants to do and then

344
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,620
we can create the tools we love hack

345
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,420
them together do whatever we want to do

346
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,980
all sorts of amazing things with

347
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,839
whatever whether it's tech or

348
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,050
fabrication or art or music food science

349
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,870
biology whatever and then we make cool

350
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,990
things and when we do we can find

351
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,630
meaningful things for each and every one

352
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,700
of us that might be meaningful for

353
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,880
others that can create a fantastic

354
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,880
cultural context to do amazing things

355
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,970
however the broader cultural context is

356
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,250
not necessarily supportive of all of

357
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,010
this the broader cultural context has a

358
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,180
whole bunch of things which aren't

359
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,390
necessarily supportive of a lot of much

360
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,339
of anything good here's one of those

361
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,180
things

362
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,040
have you noticed there's a lot of

363
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,570
capitalism around capitalism is actually

364
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,310
quite absurd if you think about it at

365
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,850
all

366
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,330
we have these pieces

367
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,890
paper with numbers in the corner

368
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,750
nowadays it's really just numbers on a

369
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,660
screen and these numbers on a screen if

370
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,430
it's not big enough you can't buy food

371
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,519
and you can't have shelter what the hell

372
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,620
so that in order to get money pieces of

373
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,300
paper with bigger numbers on a corner or

374
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,670
bigger numbers on a screen people

375
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,110
probably think of getting a job and they

376
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,510
don't really know if they're gonna like

377
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,829
their job they don't even seem to care

378
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,240
if they're gonna like their job but so

379
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,530
many people are just struggling to get

380
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,390
by they feel like if they get a job

381
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,670
whether they like it or not they feel

382
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,270
lucky that they have a job at least they

383
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,530
get to eat

384
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,500
and have shelter it doesn't necessarily

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,750
have to be that way though for instance

386
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,369
I love my job

387
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,400
I turn TVs off for a living

388
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,309
and I help other people do it too and me

389
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:28,569
and twelve of my friends have made a

390
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,880
living doing this for a long time there

391
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,270
are other possibilities but here's

392
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,790
another question and this is an

393
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:43,678
important question is technology neutral

394
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,540
people probably have very different

395
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,050
points of views on this and give you my

396
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,020
answer I'm just going to show you just

397
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,770
some examples so here is a piece of

398
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,800
technology this technology was released

399
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,050
into the world by people who wanted to

400
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,169
pound nails into probably wood

401
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,140
and it turns out that that's what it's

402
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,880
incredibly well-suited for in the

403
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,740
broader cultural context so that's

404
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,960
almost always what hammers are used for

405
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,400
or banging your thumbnail it can also be

406
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,950
used for bonking someone over the head

407
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,410
and killing them but you know that's not

408
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,390
what its best used for so what it is

409
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,419
used for mostly is banging nails into

410
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:33,510
wood here's another piece of technology

411
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,620
is that neutral that was put into a

412
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,820
world sorry it can do lots of things

413
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,160
this can be used as a hammer to pound

414
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,040
nails into wood but given the cultural

415
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
context within which what it was

416
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,380
released

417
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,230
but it's best suited for is killing and

418
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,720
that's what it's almost always used for

419
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,539
especially in our country and as I

420
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,000
travel the world which I do a lot I am

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,059
often asked by people what the

422
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,970
going on in your country but anyways

423
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,710
here's another piece of technology and

424
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,710
another

425
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,350
all my life my adult life like I said

426
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,150
earlier I've worked in small companies

427
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,260
helping them with their problems and

428
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,990
these are just a very few of the

429
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,670
companies I've I've helped with their

430
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,350
problems there are computer problems

431
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,080
usually microcontrollers and I'm really

432
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,090
good at that and these have been really

433
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,150
really really fun places to work for but

434
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,130
every single one of these in every place

435
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,809
I've ever worked without exception the

436
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,390
military has come in and wanted to take

437
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,730
our creative output and use it for

438
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,260
killing for destroying for spying and

439
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,890
every time I quit the first job I ever

440
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,350
had was making computer games on an

441
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,860
Apple 2 computer this is in 1978 in

442
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,320
Urbana Illinois and the military came in

443
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,540
and said hey his game you got there how

444
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,980
about a little just little bit of

445
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,690
tweaking custom this and we can make

446
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,670
killer helicopter training simulators

447
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,429
and the bosses wanted to make money so

448
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,440
they said yes and I didn't want to put

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,550
my time and energy into it so I quit a

450
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,960
couple years later I'm working at a

451
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,940
museum exhibit company we made lots of

452
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,890
really cool exhibits including a

453
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,260
holocaust museum exhibit that's now at

454
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,450
the Smithsonian and you press buttons

455
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,890
and their computers lots of cool stuff

456
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,510
we had to make our own graphics

457
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,130
generator which I worked on because

458
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,660
there were no graphics cards back then

459
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,610
and the military came in and said nice

460
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,370
graphics generator you got there that

461
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,590
would be great for marketing our weapon

462
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,990
systems to Congress and the bosses said

463
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,090
yes and I didn't want to put my time and

464
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,960
energy and creativity into that so I

465
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,660
quit at the place where we developed

466
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,320
virtual virtual reality called vpl in 87

467
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,640
in silly Valley we all agreed we would

468
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,960
never ever ever sell to the military but

469
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,460
the military bought one through the

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,230
University of Central Florida which we

471
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,620
did sell to and they used it for World

472
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,170
War three training simulators and I

473
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,130
helped and I couldn't put my energy into

474
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,890
it anymore at the company I started

475
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,820
three where the NSA came along and

476
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,160
wanted to use our storage

477
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,840
cards for storing information the VCS

478
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,570
that took over hired someone

479
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,850
specifically to sell to them we didn't

480
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,590
know exactly what they would use it for

481
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,380
but we could guess and now since Snowden

482
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,000
we know exactly what they're using it

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,950
for anyways

484
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,419
I quit doing that too and then in 2004 I

485
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,100
started doing tv-b-gone

486
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,220
and it turns out there's no military

487
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,900
application for turning TVs off in

488
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,440
public places for which I'm glad for but

489
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,809
I'm the boss you know so and none other

490
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:11,549
people who all of our friends none of us

491
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,200
want to do it so if the military did

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,610
want to buy stuff from is it no matter

493
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,840
how much money would make I would

494
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,590
politely tell them to off so all of

495
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,320
this is happening because of a cultural

496
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,020
context we really need to create some

497
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,970
better cultural context to put stuff

498
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,620
into the world so we can actually help

499
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,140
us and those around us but you know

500
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,270
cultural context is super important

501
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,549
you know like toilets can be used for

502
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,350
all sorts of things but in a cultural

503
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,090
context for which that are released into

504
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,610
what it's best used for is pissing and

505
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,340
pooping TVs can be used for bookshelves

506
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,010
at least the old kind can they can also

507
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,289
be used for static information like a

508
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:51,419
train station or an airport but what

509
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,980
they're best suited for within the

510
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,380
cultural context within the which they

511
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,409
exist is manipulating people through

512
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:00,090
sight and sound which are our most

513
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,049
powerful senses and manipulating us into

514
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,400
buying we don't want or need

515
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,289
anything from dish soap to political

516
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:12,570
candidates social so-called social media

517
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,000
can be used for all sorts of things -

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,919
they promise bringing us together it can

519
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,110
be used for joy and warm and fuzzy ness

520
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,480
but it's best suited for within the

521
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,700
cultural context of creating from the

522
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,260
very beginning as of course they've

523
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,659
purposely have done to make an addictive

524
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,700
platform and the best addictive things

525
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
are outrage and anger and fear and

526
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,250
hatred and manipulating people all the

527
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,900
better into buying they don't want

528
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,520
or need from dish soap - political

529
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,250
candidates part of this cultural context

530
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,750
is

531
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,450
the military in particular the US

532
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,760
military one of the biggest single the

533
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,650
biggest single aspect of the US economy

534
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,679
is the military which is also the single

535
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,679
by far biggest polluter of our planet

536
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,260
and it's also concentrating much much

537
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,240
much more wealth in the very very few

538
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,400
tiny people at the very very top and

539
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
they're using that to do weapon systems

540
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,840
which destroy and kill and spy the US

541
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,000
military is more than six times the rest

542
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,870
of the world's military put together its

543
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,950
euphemistically called Department of

544
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,870
Defense it's not about defense it's

545
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,940
about making the maximum profit that

546
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,710
they possibly can regardless of other

547
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,020
consequences and this affects so many

548
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,030
different things including things as

549
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,520
wonderful as Maker Faire which I poured

550
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,470
my heart and soul into for the first

551
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,640
five years from 2006 to 2011 starting

552
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,320
with just a few soldiering irons and

553
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,390
teaching people to solder and growing

554
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,059
really popular so I could teach

555
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,740
thousands of people in a weekend how do

556
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,350
you make cool things with electronics

557
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,299
and this is popular enough now that I

558
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,500
don't even have to do a thing and

559
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,150
there's tables full of soldiering irons

560
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,510
out there and it's totally fun but in

561
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,370
2011 after five years of pouring my

562
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,150
heart and soul into it I was awarded an

563
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,299
award named after me the Mitch Altman

564
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,419
maker Hero Award and if you want to see

565
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,520
a video of me crying out of joy and

566
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,640
happiness it's still online and this was

567
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,710
the first and the last

568
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,429
Mitch Altman maker hero award because

569
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,770
the day after that got that award it was

570
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,630
announced publicly for the first time

571
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,299
that Maker Faire and make sought-after

572
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:31,429
and received 10 million dollars from the

573
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,039
US military to do cool things the

574
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,169
thousand hackerspaces in a thousand high

575
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,140
schools but I couldn't continue to help

576
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,179
when I knew it was going to be helping

577
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,730
the military and they were recruiting at

578
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,659
Maker Faires

579
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,450
they were showing killer robots cool

580
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,840
killer robots at Maker Faires

581
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,790
DARPA had a keynote talk

582
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,850
at the Maker Faire and I know I'd feel

583
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,170
like if I quit helping Maker Faire

584
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,350
but I knew I'd feel worse if I continued

585
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,010
so I stopped but when you stop doing

586
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,410
something gives time and energy for

587
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,430
something else and I was actually

588
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,530
invited to give my first TED talk

589
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,500
TEDx Brussels when I ended up giving a

590
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,540
talk about hackerspaces which helped a

591
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,310
whole bunch of people create hacker

592
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,170
spaces around the world and it's really

593
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,950
gratifying this one project of mine did

594
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,240
pretty well it was a Kickstarter a

595
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,950
successful Kickstarter as a sleep mask

596
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,450
that works with brainwaves to help

597
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,200
people sleep very strange project but

598
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,750
you know that project I still have some

599
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,760
left but it pretty much ended but these

600
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,620
other people came along about a year ago

601
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,900
who wanted to put feedback into it to

602
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,610
make it more powerful and I was helping

603
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,830
with them for about three months they're

604
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,580
called sauna and but then it just out of

605
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,940
nowhere they said oh I just found out

606
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,000
that just talking with them on the phone

607
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,920
that they were going to be selling to

608
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,620
the US Navy because they saying you know

609
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,940
you look on the website it's it's all

610
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,680
about helping people and they want to

611
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,330
help everyone including people in the US

612
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,100
Navy evidently so I looked on their

613
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,730
website and and it's not just the US

614
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,120
Navy but it's the Air Force and then the

615
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,660
special boat service what the hell's the

616
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,120
special boat service I looked on

617
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,570
Wikipedia and it says that it's you

618
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,790
can't find out because it's classified

619
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,160
highly classified due to sensitivity of

620
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,670
their operations if it's helping people

621
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,380
I don't think would need to be highly

622
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,110
classified or sensitive and then there

623
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,250
of course there is a special air service

624
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,540
and the Royal Marines and all of this is

625
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,470
on their website and you know like so I

626
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,380
stopped helping them there's all these

627
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,870
places that I I'm diminishing number of

628
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,940
places that I feel I can put my time and

629
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,410
energy to try to make the world a better

630
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,510
place and not hurt people with my

631
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,510
creative output and one of the biggest

632
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,300
things is corporations not all

633
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,440
corporations but public

634
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,139
traded corporations exists for profit of

635
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:13,940
course the for-profit but not only

636
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,590
profit there's nothing wrong with profit

637
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,750
in and of itself but maximizing profit

638
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,820
every quarter is what they're doing

639
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,519
because if they don't the board gets

640
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,580
fired and the CEO gets fired and they

641
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,870
don't want to get fired so they're gonna

642
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,429
do whatever they can in order to

643
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:30,830
maximize profit every quarter if it if

644
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,019
they if it's more profitable to pollute

645
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,879
rather than do what's right then the

646
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,769
corporation's going to pollute if it's

647
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,600
more profitable to make a car that

648
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,909
explodes when it gets rear-ended rather

649
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:42,649
than do the right thing then the

650
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:44,389
corporation is going to do that as Ford

651
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,309
pintos did rather than because it's

652
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,309
cheaper to pay insurance for the dead

653
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,700
people's family if it's more profitable

654
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,419
to make food or so-called food of for

655
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,120
which the long-term effects aren't known

656
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,169
they're gonna do it if it's more

657
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:02,149
profitable if it's more profitable to

658
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,820
make systems like weapons systems to

659
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,730
kill destroy and spy then corporations

660
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,950
are going to do that because there exist

661
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,039
to do so if it's more profitable to pay

662
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,679
for candidates that will then in turn

663
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,600
give you laws to make more profit

664
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,590
that'll do so the US military is the top

665
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,740
of that food chain the US Supreme Court

666
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,350
after determining that corporations have

667
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,870
all of the rights but none of the

668
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,340
responsibility of human beings plus the

669
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,580
ability to have unlimited campaign

670
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,570
contributions of course they pay for

671
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,129
politicians who will then in turn in

672
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,980
turn give them laws that maximize their

673
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,720
profit and that's an amazing return on

674
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,379
investment so what do we do in the face

675
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:56,149
of all of this well first of all we've

676
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,370
got to think about what our ethics are

677
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,019
and we got to put a lot of thought into

678
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:02,240
that and there's no right and wrong with

679
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,669
any of this

680
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:07,090
well there's shades of grey dark grey

681
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,889
but each of us has to come up with our

682
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:11,450
own ways of doing that of course we can

683
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,149
do that so much better in a supportive

684
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:17,570
community but you know it's tempting to

685
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,830
accept money and governments around the

686
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,270
world are giving money and some

687
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,340
it's really good and some of it might

688
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,160
not be the thing is really really

689
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,200
important to be thinking about the

690
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,180
source there's always strings attached

691
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,640
always no matter what if the coolest

692
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,960
person that you think is the coolest

693
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,340
person in the world gives you money

694
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,980
there's still strings attached but if a

695
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,690
government agency does of course there's

696
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,960
explicit ones and also implicit ones so

697
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,230
if if the source of money aligns with

698
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,830
your values great there's a lot of good

699
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,240
chance you're going to be doing the

700
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,350
world a good turn by accepting the money

701
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,640
but if you don't agree with the values

702
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,560
of the organization or people who are

703
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,940
giving the money you are definitely

704
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,980
making the world a worse place by

705
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,070
enhancing the values you do not agree

706
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,940
with here's another question really what

707
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,970
I just said where do you draw the line

708
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,470
the world isn't perfect it's messy

709
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,050
there's no way to be perfect but we have

710
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,730
to draw the line somewhere and let's

711
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,280
keep evaluating each of us evaluating

712
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,260
where we were unwilling to cross and

713
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,020
where we are and keep them keep changing

714
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,870
that so we keep getting better for

715
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,030
myself I'm an American citizen it's

716
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,070
illegal to not pay taxes there's some

717
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,350
ways of doing it but I pay taxes I pay

718
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,440
what's legally I'm legally required but

719
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,730
not a penny more and I know for myself I

720
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,960
will never I never have and I never will

721
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,990
knowingly help the military directly or

722
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,520
indirectly that's me and I want to talk

723
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:02,390
about startups so I gotta end this

724
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,970
quickly startups you've probably noticed

725
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,760
they're almost incredibly stupid they

726
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,860
are incredibly stupid because they only

727
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,460
they are they're about money they start

728
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,110
with money and they end with money and

729
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,270
so it drives people to do that

730
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,370
incredibly stupid things IOT can be

731
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,970
incredibly cool but this is going out

732
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,740
just to make money and so all these

733
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,080
incredibly stupid things aren't in going

734
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,400
out into the world and in our cultural

735
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,950
context

736
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,250
a good thing this is a spying nightmare

737
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,370
and where we seem to be into it as a

738
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,130
class of consumers because people are

739
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,960
putting things into their homes or

740
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,059
apartments that listen to them and spy

741
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:45,490
on them 24 hours a day of everything

742
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,350
they're doing and these things have

743
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,539
security if they're a thought at all it

744
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,490
comes way after and so they can be

745
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,639
hijacked as this was done in 2016 to

746
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,590
bring down huge parts of the internet

747
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,309
Amazon reddit Twitter Netflix etc etc

748
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,570
because there was a hard-coded a

749
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,779
hard-coded password in the hardware and

750
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,429
is this the kind of stuff we want in our

751
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,510
bodies and here's a guy who wants us all

752
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:19,539
to put implants in our brains I don't

753
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,039
see him going out to put an implant in

754
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,720
his brain he wants to make money on us

755
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,700
putting implants on our brain in our

756
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,039
cultural context of all this stuff this

757
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,200
definitely doesn't end well and for

758
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,639
corporations wanting to play off

759
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,740
people's fear of death and wanting to

760
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,690
live forever people into all this stuff

761
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,130
wanting to upload their brain into

762
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,289
computer these startups start and in

763
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:39,549
fact it's actually a hundred percent

764
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:44,860
fatal the opposite of immortality we can

765
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,889
do something better I think we can do

766
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:50,559
way better than all of that you know if

767
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,750
we're going to be entrepreneurial you

768
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,250
know we can get together in community

769
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,809
and do amazing things as we've been

770
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,370
doing here and if we're going to be

771
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,470
intrapreneurial and and I'd like to

772
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,690
encourage that you don't have to but if

773
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,100
you want to be entrepreneurial don't

774
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,269
start with this a good intrapreneurial

775
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,940
person starts with meaning finding

776
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,909
meaning and then sharing that meaning

777
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,469
through whatever it is you're selling

778
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,239
because people are willing to buy

779
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,010
something they feel is meaningful if

780
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,819
you're going to do anything

781
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:20,500
intrapreneurial you've got to do it this

782
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,379
way you explore you can do that better

783
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:25,329
in community that supports you in doing

784
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,668
that explore see what works try some

785
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:29,710
things fail learn from failing we learn

786
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,089
from failing much more than our

787
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,710
successes because we fail more often

788
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,750
it's not always fun but we learn a lot

789
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,550
and then you try again and you keep

790
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,260
trying and it goes up and down it's a

791
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,270
rollercoaster we keep trying eventually

792
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,369
we find a project we think is really

793
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,050
awesome

794
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,820
maybe it's meaningful maybe the people

795
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,290
in our community think it's meaningful

796
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,940
maybe in the people in the broader

797
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,918
community find it's meaningful and now

798
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,139
you have something that people will pay

799
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,060
you to do because they'll pay you to do

800
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,830
something they feel is meaningful and

801
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,590
now you have a startup that actually has

802
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,930
some possibility of success that will

803
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,940
actually help you and the people around

804
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,630
you and maybe even our planet and the

805
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,810
thing is it doesn't need to grow we

806
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,090
can't continue to grow our economy on a

807
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,850
fine light on a finite planet we don't

808
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,310
need another Google and another Apple

809
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,560
growing is fine if it grows organically

810
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,780
it's totally fine but growing isn't

811
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,500
always a good thing

812
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,480
tv-b-gone is me and twelve people that

813
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,610
have it a small sustainable business for

814
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,380
12 years and we've made a living from it

815
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,560
what if you had a company or worked for

816
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,330
someone else's company where you felt

817
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,460
strongly that it was wonderful and you

818
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,020
could make a living from it along with

819
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,670
everyone else what would your life be

820
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,370
like what if everyone in this room

821
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,380
worked for a company like that I think

822
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,300
this is a unique situation because

823
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,040
there's so many more people here doing

824
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,260
that than any other place but still not

825
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,730
everyone here is doing that I would love

826
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,200
to see everyone here doing that and

827
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,570
everyone on our planet ideally what

828
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,310
would the world be like if people were

829
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,870
doing that we can share what we do with

830
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,950
everyone old and young we can do this

831
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,200
and do meaningful things explore and

832
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
find me is that meaningful things and

833
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,280
share them around we can by doing this

834
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,570
we can solve our problems small and huge

835
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,400
just one last question before I round up

836
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,060
what is success since this is one of the

837
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,800
things that drives so many people

838
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,410
needing to be a success but what is it

839
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:42,720
is it this that is not success that's a

840
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,319
pile of money

841
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,650
maybe you can do some cool things with

842
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,150
that pile of money but that in and of

843
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,910
itself is not success it's just a pile

844
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,369
of money what can you do with

845
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:55,660
money maybe we can do some cool things

846
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,309
but that is not going to solve the

847
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,849
world's problems but changing how we

848
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,680
live our lives and how you live and

849
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,950
learn and grow and share that is super

850
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,140
powerful but here's my definition of

851
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,670
success and I've pretty much already

852
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,220
said it but what would your life be like

853
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,799
if by doing whatever it is you love

854
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,539
doing you got enough of whatever you

855
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:20,770
need to keep doing it what more do you

856
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,359
need we all have that ability and we all

857
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,010
have that ability even much more if

858
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,690
we're in a community that supports us

859
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,260
all each individual's to keep doing that

860
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,680
the future is up to us and us alone

861
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,690
we're creating it all as we're sitting

862
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,430
here and going off and doing whatever

863
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,099
we're doing next in our lives it's up to

864
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,829
us to do these cool things because if we

865
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,200
wait for our leaders to start doing it

866
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,770
we are all going to be dead but

867
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,500
while we're alive is when we have the

868
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,569
opportunity to help ourselves and those

869
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,180
around us and if we're doing this in

870
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,760
community it's even more powerful and if

871
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,400
our communities are helping each other

872
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,069
wherever it makes sense who knows what

873
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:12,359
the world will be like very soon Thanks

874
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:27,659
