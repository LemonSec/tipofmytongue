00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,539
this is hard

7
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:20,160
welcome back our next speaker is an

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,870
electrical engineering consultant and

9
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,760
host of the empower podcast

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,260
I think it's been nine years of that

11
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,620
podcast he's also one of the original

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,610
starters of the hackaday super

13
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,280
conference and I'm really excited to

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,810
welcome Chris Gamal to the super

15
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:50,790
conference stage all right all right

16
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,230
there's no password the password is

17
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,070
password everything up there okay well

18
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,140
welcome this is called gaining RF

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,320
knowledge a little pun there but this is

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,930
about me trying out RF circuits and what

21
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,820
I've been learning and so I have some

22
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,890
goals for this talk basically want to

23
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,929
talk about how I got into this I want to

24
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,280
explain it to you without bearing you in

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,410
math because there there's a lot of math

26
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,510
you can do and then also give you some

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,640
resources and maybe some inspiration for

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,780
how you can make it on your own because

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,060
there's a lot of fun stuff out there so

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,220
first off who are you who has

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,840
electronics experiences to show ants I

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,510
expect many okay how about RF experience

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,420
and then probably a subset of that ham

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,600
radio experience okay great and so like

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,890
some of you might have some more

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,330
experience in some of these areas than I

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,739
do and that's great I think it's

38
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,720
important to to know that like so I've

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,209
been doing electronics 15 years and I've

40
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,340
done a lot electronics but you know RF

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,580
is kind of newish and so it's been there

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,440
I just I started in a different realm so

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,290
I started working on these this is a

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,940
electrometer this thing takes an entire

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,670
six readings per second because it is

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,680
averaging things very slowly and you

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
want to like average things to get

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,500
better

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,780
low low voltage readings and stuff like

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,050
that so not exactly blazing speed but

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,840
some things change for me well it didn't

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
change for me becasue it's always been

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,380
everywhere right but now it's also in

54
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,260
every product and it's also everywhere

55
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,390
of course and in every product in fact I

56
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,500
have a product I'm working on right now

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,890
it has five antennas in it and

58
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,920
that's because it's cheap right it is so

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,540
cheap to get parts this is a part on

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,970
LCSC right now that's like 30 cents for

61
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,770
a for 33 megahertz receiver I'll tell

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,300
you all about that chip or that's a

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,090
strands transmitter rather so I'll tell

64
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,840
you about that after they work

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,780
afterwards if you want to see it but I

66
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,310
assume that we have similar goals you're

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,690
interested in making things you probably

68
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,730
wouldn't be here if you weren't you're

69
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,440
excited about cheap and connected

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
hardware and you want to know how to

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,860
integrate it so that's kinda what we're

72
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,410
gonna be talking about here so how I got

73
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:51,830
started

74
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,709
any guesses that's right I copy the app

75
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,200
note we all do that and that's actually

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,330
pretty common you know basically I

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,730
usually guess about 80 percent of PCB

78
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,110
designs or re-implemented app notes you

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,640
know the things that are different on

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,590
designs they don't need to be right if

81
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,080
they're already done ain't broke don't

82
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,239
fix the kind of thing but I also follow

83
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,160
the guidelines in fact five years ago in

84
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,989
the first Super Con one of my favorite

85
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,760
all-time talks mr. Osmond who's giving a

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,100
talk over at the other section right now

87
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,168
he gave these five rules of RF design

88
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,880
this is a great great talk there's a

89
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,440
link here that'll be in the notes but

90
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,680
also go check it out and you know some

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,729
just great guidelines for getting

92
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,370
started with RF so how about my first RF

93
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,700
design I was doing a little Cellular

94
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,490
board and it worked right now I wouldn't

95
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,020
necessarily think that a first design

96
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,550
would work out of the gate but it it

97
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,040
just happened to why is that this is

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
because this is a modem and an antenna

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,229
and basically the shortest possible

100
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,140
trace I could put between them in fact

101
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,030
an antenna connector than you a little

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,130
UofL connector and so I basically

103
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,410
minimize my interaction with it I kept

104
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,940
everything really short I didn't really

105
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,470
have to do much but also you know I

106
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,210
should it you know admit that I didn't

107
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,380
have to tape this thing super far this

108
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,690
is just a test board I got it out there

109
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,850
I got it working so the real question is

110
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,710
can we do this all the time right well

111
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,630
maybe you know you can it depends on

112
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,280
what you're what you're working on are

113
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
you working on devices that have pre

114
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,020
matched outputs and inputs and things

115
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,729
like that maybe but if you're gonna be

116
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,470
doing uncharacterized things if you're

117
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,490
like well I want to design my own

118
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,690
antennas and I want to design my own

119
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,830
front ends and I want to design

120
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,870
everything well it's gonna get a little

121
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,070
harder then you're gonna have to do a

122
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,600
little bit more work and that's probably

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,610
also with outside the scope of this talk

124
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,039
cuz I've have not taken that that jump

125
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,160
yet I mean I've started making

126
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
antennas but you'll see how that one

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,640
later yeah so why did I want to do this

128
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,470
first off is troubleshooting this is

129
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,330
what I call the two a.m. problem what

130
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,740
happens when it's 2 a.m. in the morning

131
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,200
I've got something new the next day and

132
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,630
I'm on my bench and I'm just struggling

133
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,100
to get something working you need to

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,470
have a bunch of tools in your toolbox

135
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,060
like the talk I gave last year you need

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,740
to have some troubleshooting tools so

137
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,300
that you know how to fix things or at

138
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,400
least know what's going on or maybe who

139
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,380
to call that kind of thing another thing

140
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,270
is FCC and compliance testing and things

141
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,070
like that you need to understand what's

142
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,630
happening at the physical level so that

143
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,530
you actually can fix things and also you

144
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,360
know it's not cheap to pay someone else

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,740
to fix these things so if you understand

146
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,570
these these concepts you can save a lot

147
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,620
of money you could save your clients a

148
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,060
lot of money that kind of thing and

149
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,890
finally being a good RF citizen right

150
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,360
you don't want to be spewing noise into

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,690
the spectrum and be messing up someone

152
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,980
else's product right down the street and

153
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,900
or maybe having the FCC knocking on your

154
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,880
door that's not fun so let's talk about

155
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,700
some concepts that are tricky here first

156
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,830
off thing that I always struggle with is

157
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,810
kind of just looking at things in the

158
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,330
frequency domain right so when you're

159
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,980
talking about signals in general right

160
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,570
you you know there's the time time

161
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,950
domain and there's the frequency domain

162
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,700
and they're very closely interwoven but

163
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,220
it's kind of hard to visualize what one

164
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,580
or the other is but sorry but I found

165
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,770
fantastic online animation for this

166
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,510
thing so this is basically showing you

167
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,730
know a you know square wave and showing

168
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,140
some of the frequency components within

169
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,669
it right so this is if you've ever done

170
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,080
Fourier transforms right you can

171
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,300
represent any signal with sines and

172
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,340
cosines but if you start to look at how

173
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,600
those constructively and destructively

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,180
interfere with one another they start to

175
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,880
make all these other cosines and at

176
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,470
different frequencies right and then you

177
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,640
can look at them and this is actually

178
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,020
the frequency here right you see how

179
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,580
that chart kind of plays back and forth

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,350
I thought this is just a fantastic

181
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,169
animation I wish I would have seen this

182
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,000
15-20 years ago but I think that's

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,130
really a tough concept to get through

184
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,010
and but if you start to understand how

185
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,120
these things interplay with one another

186
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,980
you start to understand things a little

187
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,010
bit better also waterfall plots are

188
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,210
another thing that I wish I would have

189
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,039
seen much earlier in my career right so

190
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,900
this is an FM radio station right what

191
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,610
you can see is if so this is actually

192
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,840
the top side this is like

193
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,130
spectrum analyzer we'll talk about that

194
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,020
a little bit more but at the top you

195
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
have the frequency that's happening with

196
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,949
an FM radio station but then if you look

197
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,780
down here and you turn your head to the

198
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,220
right you're like wait a second

199
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,290
that's an audio signal right it's an

200
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,699
audio signal streaming down there and

201
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,680
it's like that interplay between the two

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,479
is a hard thing to wrap your head around

203
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,070
at the beginning but it is such an

204
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,780
important concept because then you could

205
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,000
start to think of things like oh what is

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,040
the bandwidth of the signal well just go

207
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,970
from the left to the right and that's

208
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,590
the width of the signal bandwidth like

209
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,660
it's it's such a simple thing when you

210
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,370
hear the words now but until you

211
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,260
visualize it it's a really hard concept

212
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
to get through or at least it was for me

213
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,270
all right so another hard concept

214
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,740
components act differently based on

215
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,099
frequency right this is the the basis of

216
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,539
reactive components and things like that

217
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,900
but capacitors they allow they block

218
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,159
frequencies from passing through at low

219
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,450
frequencies but they allow them at high

220
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,250
frequencies right and basically where

221
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,440
that transition occurs it's the

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,380
capacitance of the component in the

223
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,480
other way now inductors right they allow

224
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,770
frequencies to pass through and they're

225
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,300
low but they block them on their high

226
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,540
and again where that transition happens

227
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,220
is the inductance of the component and

228
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,930
the other thing that's important though

229
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,089
is that both of these components no

230
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,320
matter what type of component you have

231
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,510
have both of these characteristics if

232
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,690
you have a lead capacitor well you have

233
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,130
a capacitor there you have two plates

234
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,080
effectively but you also have leads on

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,220
the end which are wires which are

236
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,959
effectively inductors and so what you

237
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,070
start to see as you start to see

238
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,040
capacitance you know it's a certain

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,170
frequency you have a resonant frequency

240
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,130
and then it starts to go in the other

241
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,410
direction and again these are important

242
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,230
characteristics to understand because

243
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,339
it's going to impact your design you

244
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,570
think oh well there's a capacitor it's

245
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,860
gonna be it's gonna be blocking that

246
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,750
frequency well yeah until a certain

247
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,400
frequency and then it no longer is

248
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,339
then it's a pathway and so again that's

249
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,589
another tough concept to start getting

250
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,480
your head around

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
another thing that's tough for me is

252
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,850
thinking logarithmically right so

253
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,760
everything is now it's orders of

254
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,130
magnitude effectively right and you see

255
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,459
things like DB and DBM and that there

256
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,870
are orders of magnitude the nice thing

257
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,250
is that you can start to do different

258
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,750
types of math when you're looking at

259
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,030
things like gains but it can be tough to

260
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,530
think like that if you're working in the

261
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,470
realm of DC and analog voltages and

262
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,880
things like that

263
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,050
the important thing is it's kind of all

264
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,819
about the power right so we're really

265
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:07,259
talking about how powers add together

266
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,269
and usually what we're doing is we're

267
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,610
analyzing the systems in terms of how

268
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,269
the powers actually increase or decrease

269
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:17,069
based on what elements you have in the

270
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:19,170
system so let's talk about an RF path

271
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,089
here right so if you have a radio you

272
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,829
have a cable which might degrade the

273
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,389
signal right you have an antenna with

274
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,980
some gain in it right then your your

275
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,959
signal power goes up a little bit you

276
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,220
have a path right so it's going through

277
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,079
the air from maybe your badge to someone

278
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,339
else's badge if they both have radios

279
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,410
again you have a receipt antenna or gain

280
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,380
cable degrading and then finally have a

281
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,790
receiving radio now obviously there's a

282
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,589
lot of other components in here but the

283
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,290
idea is but between the Rx the TX port

284
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,480
part and the RX part there's some margin

285
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,649
there and this is basically this is the

286
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,940
this is the this is that thing I forgot

287
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,980
the term but basically we're trying to

288
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,930
minimize the degradation and all these

289
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,970
things right so we want to make sure

290
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,009
that we have minimal degradation and

291
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,579
noise in the system so next up on this

292
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,670
slide is this math is actually wrong I

293
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,660
figured out a five minutes before the

294
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,819
talk but uh link budget is the term I

295
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,139
was looking for there so if your link

296
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,970
budget was 100 DB to get from one side

297
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,589
of the other right you you know that you

298
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,230
can have up to 100 DB of loss from what

299
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,670
any other that actually means that is

300
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,490
not one 100,000 that's actually I got

301
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,500
those backwards this is the this is the

302
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,630
voltage difference if it's power right

303
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,889
it would actually be one ten-billionth

304
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,949
as much power right because it's ten log

305
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,560
the signal right so it'd be 10 billion

306
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,439
is 10 zeros right and then I said be log

307
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,620
10 of 10 billion is 10 divided by 10 is

308
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,620
that 100 right so that's 100 DB so

309
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,939
that's how much smaller your signal

310
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,399
could be from TX to rx so that's kind of

311
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,870
crazy right that amount of of

312
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,670
degradation that you could you could get

313
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,779
you think about your cell phones and

314
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,579
things like that or 100 plus DB of of

315
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,579
capability so next up impedance matching

316
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,500
so this is another thing we want to make

317
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,389
sure we're not each introducing more

318
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,329
degradation by the transmitter and the

319
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:07,680
receiver sorry the transmitter and

320
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,540
antenna might not be matched well and if

321
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,480
they're not matched well then

322
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,250
you start to have problems there right

323
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,100
the sorry the maximum power transfer

324
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,500
happens when they are matched but what

325
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,550
about when they're not right so say

326
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,770
you're designing a new board you get an

327
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,230
e SP 32 chip right and then you decide

328
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,310
hey I'm going to design my own antenna

329
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,260
here but it's not properly matched you

330
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,190
don't have a right matching network

331
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,810
there well some of the things that might

332
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,220
happen you might not transmit as far as

333
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,410
you thought that's not terrible but you

334
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,030
also might have a less efficient system

335
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,200
right you've been burn out more battery

336
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,030
it might not just work you might not get

337
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,410
enough you might not have enough link

338
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,880
budget to get from one point to another

339
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,230
and finally might actually damage your

340
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,700
output if you are really poorly matched

341
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,860
you basically have reflected power that

342
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,770
could damage your output what is

343
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,090
impedance though right so it's basically

344
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,900
how again how it passes or blocks energy

345
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,760
at different frequencies right so why do

346
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,990
we need these matching at all because

347
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,250
you know you think if you have an

348
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,510
antenna that's already matched it's

349
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,860
probably gonna be at something like 50

350
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,410
ohms well it doesn't always work like

351
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,850
that right sometimes your antenna is not

352
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,200
going to be perfectly matched sometimes

353
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,080
you have things in between like PCB or

354
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,820
you have traces or you have connectors

355
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,050
and there's a lot of things that could

356
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,940
be in there that can affect your the

357
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,260
impedance and matching one thing to

358
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,700
another and so we'll go through some

359
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,560
some measurement things you can do to do

360
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,450
that but if you know that you have

361
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,670
something like let's say a thousand ohm

362
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,830
source right and a hundred ohm load then

363
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,480
you might have to actually do something

364
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,610
like a PI network in between the two to

365
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,310
take reserve capacity and inductors to

366
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,020
go and in part this there's this new

367
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,610
pathway so that it's a different

368
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,280
impedance basically to match the load to

369
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,560
the source let's talk about some of the

370
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,420
management tools that are out there one

371
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,190
is one you've already seen here that is

372
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,050
a spectrum analyzer right that's a

373
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,160
something already saw there but

374
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,200
basically this is kind of like the scope

375
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,610
of the frequency world which I realize

376
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,790
is a gross simplification but it allows

377
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,010
you a snapshot of the spectral component

378
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,110
right and what we saw earlier was the

379
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,670
waterfall plot the idea is that you want

380
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,440
to see what's happening at any given

381
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,500
time with the frequency command what's

382
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,760
happening out there that can be useful

383
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,850
you might want to capture that you know

384
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,250
your Bluetooth devices sent a packet or

385
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,600
you want to see that it's hopping

386
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,760
through different frequencies as

387
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,530
Bluetooth does right and again you might

388
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,310
have something like this where you have

389
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,350
a waterfall plot right this is just a

390
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,810
spectrum over time and that allows you

391
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,050
to see this waterfall here another big

392
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,000
one is a VNA so this is a vector network

393
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,070
analyzer and these definitely come in

394
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,720
all shapes and sizes as I've been

395
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,029
learning they come from the very cheap

396
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,270
and the upper-left there to be much more

397
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,890
expensive even though there are 30 year

398
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,810
old components in the lower right there

399
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,779
that's a $4,000 thing that was made in

400
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,230
the 80s and then also you might also go

401
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,120
out and shop for a component or a VNA

402
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,770
rather on ebay and get very excited and

403
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,600
then you you say oh my god this thing's

404
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,150
only 567 dollars and it looks so nice

405
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,589
and then you realize that you read a

406
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,830
couple of those zeros wrong and it's

407
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,800
$567,000 so it can also do that which is

408
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,670
cool but these allows you to do things

409
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,860
like look at Smith's charts right it's

410
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,690
actually a measurement tool but you

411
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,940
could and it allows you that to help

412
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,760
matching between a load and a source

413
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,680
again right and so a Smith chart looks

414
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,390
like this and I was always very scared

415
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,800
of these but now I'm less scared of

416
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,150
these because I've been able to play

417
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,060
with a VNA and go through some of the

418
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,990
calculations and seeing them hands-on

419
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,250
really really helps for that kind of

420
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,080
thing so you can take something like a

421
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,060
VNA and many of them allow you to to

422
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,610
chart the frequency responses on a Smith

423
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,140
chart and you can see hey where is this

424
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,690
thing actually reacting in the unit

425
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,020
circle and how is it impacting my design

426
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,580
other things you might want to use an ax

427
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,320
VNA for if it's got the the right stuff

428
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,540
there is a s11 which is these are all s

429
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,830
parameters so basically these are

430
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,470
between a two port system right you

431
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,170
might know that so if you have an

432
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,510
antenna you might want to test how well

433
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,800
that antenna is gonna be matched to your

434
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,120
system right so that might be something

435
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,070
like return loss right this is also

436
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,660
known as a reflection coefficient so

437
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,070
something like this you'd be looking at

438
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,040
and you'd say okay well at the 2.4

439
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,380
gigahertz frequency or so it looks like

440
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,520
it's worse or it looks like it's going

441
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,690
down but what that actually is is it

442
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,910
it's reflecting less of the signal right

443
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,770
so more of it actually is going into the

444
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,330
antenna of the antenna is accepting more

445
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,650
of that signal you actually don't know

446
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,630
if it's transmitting it but you know hey

447
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,220
at least a 2.4 gigahertz it's not

448
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,200
bouncing it back to the source of this

449
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,610
VNA so that's important to know

450
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,640
SWR is another kind of similar sort and

451
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,440
sort of similar it's more ratiometric so

452
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,760
basically again this kind of helps to

453
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,810
tell how well

454
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,029
how how this energy is reflecting back

455
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,610
SWS standing wave ratio so basically as

456
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,500
you have things constructively

457
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,680
destructively interacting as you start

458
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,660
to pump different frequencies into it

459
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,570
you can see how this reacts and then the

460
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,880
ratio of those things happening another

461
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,529
very important piece of equipment that I

462
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,410
learned about is a Cal kit basically a

463
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,000
lot of the test equipments out there

464
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,619
specifically VNA is you need to

465
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,740
basically know that you have an open a

466
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,689
short and a load and what you do is you

467
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,990
can then you can also start to get rid

468
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,520
of effects from things like cables and

469
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,560
connectors and things like that and so

470
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,270
this was a really big part of my

471
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,980
practice I actually got a VNA and I

472
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,459
don't think this is a video so what I

473
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,170
did is I went and I designed an antenna

474
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,930
and it you know I went cut it out on

475
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,250
this mill that I have that was kind of

476
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,580
fun

477
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,250
and and so I thought hey I'm gonna go

478
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,320
and try and make a 433 megahertz antenna

479
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,780
and then I'm gonna go put on this VNA

480
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,490
that I have that was cool and I measured

481
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,590
all of the you know all the different

482
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,750
parameters here right so this is the VNA

483
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,520
that I had and you can see the cable is

484
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,650
going out to the antenna through a SMA

485
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,990
connector that's great and really this

486
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,550
helped me get a fuel for measurements

487
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,230
right so what are these and what is the

488
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,210
insertion loss what is the SWR how does

489
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,740
it change when I put my hand in front of

490
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,630
it right this is some just practical

491
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,600
literal hands-on things where you can

492
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,190
read a book but you don't know how it's

493
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,600
gonna react until you actually have it

494
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,210
in hand having that kind of that mental

495
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,710
model that you're developing really

496
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,730
really helps when you have some test

497
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,140
equipment it's unfortunate it is you

498
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,640
know not cheap test equipment but

499
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,230
there's some low it like I said some

500
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,490
there's some lower cost stuff that you

501
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,960
can start to do if you're at a lower

502
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,700
frequencies I was trying to go straight

503
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,590
for 2.4 gigahertz which is you know

504
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,420
Bluetooth Wi-Fi kind of frequencies

505
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,010
that's unfortunately still pretty

506
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,840
expensive but if you're you know in the

507
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,340
ham bands and you're you know a couple

508
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,929
hundred megahertz stuff like that it can

509
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,480
really help so getting a feel for

510
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,679
antenna designs the good ones are the

511
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,940
ones that are off-the-shelf the bad ones

512
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,940
are the ones that Kris designs so it

513
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,620
turns out yeah antenna design is its own

514
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,600
kind of beast in there even you know a

515
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,679
lot of this stuff I was doing I was

516
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,590
copying again just trying trying to get

517
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,610
stuff up and running and trying it and

518
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,900
[Music]

519
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,090
I did not do well and that's okay

520
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,010
because I got to try a couple different

521
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,720
things and get a feel for that mental

522
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,070
model is really really important and

523
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,200
then also people in the community helped

524
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,870
me a ton other important constraints

525
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,730
that I learned is things like cables

526
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,930
right you start to move cables around

527
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,390
you have bad you know hey I found some

528
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,850
cheap cables on Amazon boy you get what

529
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,310
you pay for and you know like things

530
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,570
that the importance of connectors and

531
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,460
the importance of calibration and how

532
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,930
that's gonna interplay all of these

533
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,370
things will end up impacting your

534
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,680
measurement which will and again go back

535
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,490
and impact your mental model and how you

536
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,330
understand all these things and so

537
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,590
that's kind of what I've been learning

538
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,590
throughout all of this is not just how

539
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,630
to make antennas how they're gonna react

540
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,190
but then how do I measure things how do

541
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,170
I understand what's working because

542
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,430
again that - you know I always talk

543
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,250
about that - am problem if if I'm

544
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,270
banging my head against the wall or

545
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,830
against the bench until 2:00 in the

546
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,780
morning then I realized hey this it was

547
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,090
a bad cable that's just a bad bad

548
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,780
scenario to be in because I'm kind of

549
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,090
chasing ghosts at that point so let's

550
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,540
get back to the me being a DC person and

551
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,470
then kind of getting into the RF realm

552
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,760
so these are some of the assumptions

553
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,590
that I've had throughout the years as a

554
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,100
did analog design and things like that

555
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,020
first off is a wire is just a wire right

556
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,030
that sounds like it's a trap right from

557
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,180
the beginning but actually every wire is

558
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,380
an inductor and if you look at many

559
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,330
inductors they are literally just wires

560
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,980
right you take out why are you coiling

561
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,540
around you have a little air core there

562
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,030
and it's an inductor and what that means

563
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,710
for our circuit is where as we thought

564
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,600
that current is going to flow from one

565
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
point to another at low frequencies

566
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
which it will as you start to go at

567
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,820
higher and higher frequencies you're

568
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,400
going to have different constraints and

569
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,230
different problems around that so a good

570
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,940
example here is one that many people get

571
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,430
started with is that when you're working

572
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,450
with bread boards and things like that

573
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,250
you start to get up in the tens and

574
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,020
hundreds of megahertz your bread board

575
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,280
just kind of stops working that's

576
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,560
because the inductance of your not just

577
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,880
the wires you're using but also the

578
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,830
strip underneath the bread board things

579
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,310
like that

580
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,110
your signal quality falls off you start

581
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,770
to see lots of different problems there

582
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,750
another one is that these all sound like

583
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,570
traps but does that PCB construction

584
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,380
isn't as

585
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,419
as the as those components that are

586
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,760
placed on the PCB says the guy that's a

587
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,960
fan of Chi CAD but I think an RF it's

588
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,240
even more kind of important right you're

589
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,590
starting to pay attention to your stack

590
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,960
up I'm really excited about a lot of the

591
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,700
you know the low-cost community-based

592
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,080
options that are out there for people to

593
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,820
learn PCB design I think it's great that

594
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,590
people are learning with things like hi

595
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,270
CAD but you know most of the time people

596
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,309
don't care about what's going on inside

597
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,260
the stack up right I hardly ever send

598
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,049
out drawings that specify my you know my

599
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,160
different dielectrics and things like

600
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,289
that but that really matters that

601
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,480
impacts every piece of your signal

602
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,159
pathway it's not just when you have you

603
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,320
know controlled and peed in this line

604
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,929
but when you're in the gigahertz range

605
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,330
right it basically the inductance of a

606
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,539
trace the dielectric of your of your

607
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:52,270
your board material what the thicknesses

608
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,830
of these different things it can really

609
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,770
start to impact what your signal

610
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,710
integrity looks like on an on board also

611
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,690
your actual construction of the board

612
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,159
how you know how you're setting up the

613
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,840
you know if you decide to put your Ron

614
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,940
Klain on an your third layer instead of

615
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,650
your second layer these things might not

616
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,610
seem important when you're getting

617
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,500
started but they really can have outside

618
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,940
effects when you start to do

619
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,490
high-frequency things like all right so

620
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,110
like I said understanding the stack up

621
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,919
is an is important for your your PCB

622
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,240
when you're starting to get into the

623
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,980
higher frequencies and there's other

624
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,330
crazy things you'll hear talking people

625
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,710
talking about like the weave of

626
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,929
fiberglass and you know how how those

627
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:31,299
things are inter plying there's an

628
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,539
infinitely deep hole to dive down for

629
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,220
for learning this stuff which is still

630
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,870
exciting you know after I've been 15

631
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,610
years like I said there's still so much

632
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,659
to learn that's so exciting

633
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,690
I love it okay so capacitor is there for

634
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,039
charge stores right another trap

635
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,870
statement but yeah it's not just there

636
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,490
for charge storage obviously there are a

637
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,230
lot of other effects that happen within

638
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,330
a capacitor right this is a you know an

639
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,039
equivalent model for a capacitor right

640
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,630
you have ESR what a lot of people hear

641
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,250
about ESL like if you have a lead on

642
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,740
there even if you have a you know 603

643
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,179
resistor there is inductance in that

644
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,770
lead how you connect to the board all

645
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,480
these things you have resistance in

646
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,919
there so you think it's a capacitor but

647
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,970
it's actually doing all these other

648
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,270
things and it really starts to impact

649
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,909
how your your signals are going to react

650
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,170
on the board

651
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,900
this is one this one hurt a little bit

652
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,580
because this is you know looking back at

653
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,750
my board designs over the years I'm like

654
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,450
oh wow I definitely made some some bad

655
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,670
choices there but you know you start to

656
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,430
look at how so I always thought that

657
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,750
current can be isolated by ground cuts

658
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,250
right in a can at low frequencies if

659
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,660
you're doing an audio board you big and

660
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,400
put a big cut in the trace and all that

661
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,410
low frequency noise you got that hum in

662
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,910
your ground plane your power plane and

663
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,930
might you know it might be a little

664
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,070
quieter on the other side of the cut

665
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,440
well that's definitely a good technique

666
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,750
in fact one of my favorite app notes

667
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,010
that are out there by Hank stumblin

668
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,330
right he talks all about this right I

669
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,280
mean and he covers all the RF things too

670
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,260
but but basically you know he puts a

671
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,000
slit in the ground plane right and

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,650
that's a great thing but another way

673
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,630
that you do another time that people put

674
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,430
a slit in the ground plane is when you

675
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,840
make an antenna that's literally how you

676
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,090
make these these kinds of an antennas so

677
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,640
you you know you have to imagine all

678
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,840
these other effects when you start to

679
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,790
move up in the frequency range and this

680
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,740
is something that I was looking at and

681
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,080
looking at I'm like oh boy okay well my

682
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,970
boards worked for a lot of the stuff I

683
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,660
do so I'm doing great so the last one

684
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,920
was that current follows the path of

685
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,390
least resistance right again it sounds

686
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,950
like a truism but it's actually not

687
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,100
really true this is I will say up front

688
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,900
here I didn't really do a ton you know I

689
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,670
know that my thing said I was gonna do a

690
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,230
ton with Maxwell's equations I have a

691
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,600
long way to go to understand Maxwell

692
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,070
anyone understand Maxwell's equations in

693
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,080
the audience whoa

694
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,010
alright brave souls here yeah so still

695
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,980
still a lot to understand there and but

696
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,920
it's basically what I've learned about

697
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,450
when I've been studying a lot of

698
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,920
Maxwell's equation stuff is that it's a

699
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,630
lot of approximations and this is

700
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,160
another one where I say current follows

701
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,210
a path of least resistance is actually

702
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,060
the path of paths of least impedance

703
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,660
right and at higher speeds basically in

704
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,280
PETA's takes on more complex terms and

705
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,080
so what you start to see is things like

706
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,970
the magnetic fields between signals

707
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,650
start to flow in opposite directions and

708
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,850
they start to cancel out this is why you

709
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,250
you hear things about your return path

710
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,990
is almost always gonna follow underneath

711
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,320
the trace right and so it's thinking

712
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,800
about things like well to go back to to

713
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,590
go back to this one right you'd think

714
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,240
that from point A to point B here right

715
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,220
so that it would be a direct path back

716
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,050
here but actually because it's right

717
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,650
underneath the trace it wants to

718
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,020
underneath the trace now and that starts

719
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,410
to change my opinion of how my stuff is

720
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,280
laid out it's not gonna make it any

721
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,510
easier I'm still gonna think about oh

722
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,280
well I shouldn't put a ton of you know

723
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,110
circuitry between the two but it does

724
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,270
change your mental model of how you

725
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,530
treat all of these things so I also

726
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,000
mentioned in my abstract about Bluetooth

727
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,780
cellular Wi-Fi lower all these things

728
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,850
these are all brand names right these

729
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,309
are all things that happen at different

730
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,720
layers of the stack right I've been

731
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,280
talking a lot of the physical the

732
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,820
physical side of things right where you

733
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,260
have electromagnetic waves you having

734
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,520
you know and you have all these things

735
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,080
happening in the real world but

736
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,720
bluetooth and Laura and Bluetooth and

737
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,110
Wi-Fi are both 2.4 gigahertz right Laura

738
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,240
is at these different frequencies 433

739
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,340
915 868 depending where you are right

740
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,309
GSM is 900 and all these different

741
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,990
frequencies as well these are all things

742
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,860
that are happening at different

743
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,030
frequencies they all have different

744
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,710
constraints based on the frequencies

745
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,520
that they're based upon but they're not

746
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,740
necessarily all that different once they

747
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,090
get out in the world right obviously

748
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,010
they're they're doing different hopping

749
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,290
and they have a lot of software layers

750
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,210
up on top of them but it's not

751
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,590
necessarily that different once you get

752
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,780
out in the real world and the physics of

753
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,900
it doesn't change all that much either

754
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,070
so let's talk about some resources here

755
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,200
this is a lot of what I was doing was

756
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,450
reading a lot of books especially on the

757
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,800
lay out side of things I was found it

758
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,320
really interesting to to learn about the

759
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,590
how my layout might change and so things

760
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,100
like the board layout the stack ups you

761
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,300
might want to have I talked about some

762
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,280
of that stuff here also just general RF

763
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,330
circuit design these are some of the

764
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,100
books that I read these are not all of

765
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,590
the books I read but then also a planer

766
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,390
microwave engineering this is one of my

767
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,160
favorite technical books I've ever read

768
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,750
I had Tom Lee on the amp hour if you

769
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,040
have not I don't know if anyone listens

770
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,730
some people hopefully listen but got one

771
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,130
Tom Lee is like one of the best guests

772
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,620
I've ever had on the show and he's just

773
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,620
like funny and he loves the history of

774
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,090
RF and the whole first chapter of that

775
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,250
book is about the history of like RF and

776
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,960
how we got here so highly recommend that

777
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,929
one another one is YouTube I think

778
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:38,090
YouTube is a great way to learn and Alan

779
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,220
Wilkie who does W - aw great Channel

780
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,440
and the signal path Shahriyar people

781
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,910
don't know Shahriyar obviously he has a

782
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,830
great YouTube channel he's also the lead

783
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,820
chip designer at Bell Labs so yeah he's

784
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,800
got some chops so highly recommend go

785
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,450
and check those out I think that there's

786
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,160
also a great way to get started without

787
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,620
having to you know necess

788
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,880
I'll of having a soldering iron in hand

789
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,290
but I feel like that's almost too

790
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,270
limiting sometimes when you're trying to

791
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,490
do a lot of this RF stuff and so things

792
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,620
like RTL are SDR and canoe radio

793
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,720
obviously mics over there give another

794
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,040
talk about software-defined radio right

795
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,830
now but I think PAC RF that's what Mike

796
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,740
does these are great ways to get started

797
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,140
without needing to have you know lots

798
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,760
and lots of equipment you can try things

799
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,140
out you can visualize things you can

800
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,360
look at things like you know spectrum

801
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,730
and and see how radio waves interact

802
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,040
with one another so a very big fan of

803
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,630
those and I definitely recommend all

804
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,070
these things as well as a last point I

805
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,480
learning is critical my job and so I

806
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,790
want to learn about these things I keep

807
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,320
learning about these things so if if you

808
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,330
find me afterwards RF testing I want to

809
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,060
talk about that connectivity options

810
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,110
like I said I have an antenna or I have

811
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,790
a board with five antennas on it that's

812
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,130
there are all different Bluetooth flora

813
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,300
all those different things that are on

814
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,490
there and I've been getting into

815
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,620
microcontrollers as well in AWS so I'd
