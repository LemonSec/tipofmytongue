5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,790
all right well good morning our next

6
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,070
speaker is a firmware engineer who has

7
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,990
plenty of experience working with

8
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,360
consumer electronics like the Amazon

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,480
echo and IOT scooters his present focus

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,940
is on exploring smaller hardware and

11
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,890
what it takes to get a product off the

12
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,980
ground from scratch his talk today will

13
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,080
take us through the process of designing

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,229
test fixtures and manufacturing please

15
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,119
welcome to the hackaday super conference

16
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:38,470
stage Kari sharp glass well I think we

17
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,360
had an oopsie this this is the thing

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,660
that you that you think it is all right

19
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,340
so the thesis for this talk is

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,860
relatively simple and it let me put

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,700
things like this on a very large screen

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,440
the security stuff that you see in the

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,619
news is the like sexy hot vulns like

24
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,600
differential power analysis and the

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,190
chinese government putting computers in

26
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,289
your computers and people freezing the

27
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,910
ram in your laptop so that they can dump

28
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,369
the TPM crypto keys and things like that

29
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,610
but that's not that's not real I mean

30
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,710
it's real it really happens but it

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,420
probably doesn't matter to you the

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,130
problems that matter to you are probably

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,950
more like you should use cipher block

34
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,140
chaining on your symmetric cryptography

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,940
and maybe you should only do firmware

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,380
updates through a cable instead of

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,590
through the Bluetooth so there's kind of

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,050
what we're going to explore um why you

39
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,970
should maybe consider carrying I guess

40
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,780
um I'm a firmware engineer I have I was

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,920
working at a consulting company for a

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,510
while and shipped a bunch of kind of

43
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,780
firmware widgets we mostly worked on

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,550
consumer electronic things most of the

45
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,319
rest of this talk is going to end up

46
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,569
being examples from that one of those

47
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,310
companies is dead but I swear that's not

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,920
related to my firmware that was someone

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,090
else's problem so some more caveats this

50
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,090
is probably mostly relevant for like

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,970
bare metal kind of microcontroller type

52
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,760
complexity or maybe like a real-time

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,130
operating system maybe less relevant for

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,590
like it's a full Windows computer but

55
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,280
then

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,630
and it turns out it's actually not

57
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,340
really a technical problem I might argue

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,380
so that level of complexity doesn't

59
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,069
necessarily matter the other caveat is

60
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,630
if you're building payment processing

61
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,040
hardware you shouldn't be learning about

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,930
security from a kind of stage somewhere

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,520
you should talk to a professional but I

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,020
don't I think that expectation is

65
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,690
probably appropriately set already so

66
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,700
this is the whole talk basically in this

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,170
one slide which is that you should think

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,459
about security at all when you're

69
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,640
building a product that's it that's fine

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,650
you can you can that's it we can I can

71
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,880
put the mic back in we get we get in the

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,980
talk now thank you

73
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,269
if we wanted to break that down a little

74
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,880
bit the basic process for building a

75
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,310
product is kind of in the shape of you

76
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,690
you kind of like to find the product a

77
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,980
little bit and then you iterate a bunch

78
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,050
and use some prototyping and you're just

79
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,370
a manufacturing ramp and you ship the

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,800
widget so at all of those points you

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
want to do this cool thing called threat

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,989
modeling which we're gonna talk about

83
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,110
more in a moment where you kind of

84
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,060
figure out what problems could exist and

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,110
figure out what you're gonna bother

86
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,580
solving and figure out what you're not

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,050
gonna bother solving cuz it doesn't

88
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,940
matter and that's kind of a continuous

89
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,280
process once you've figured out what the

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
product actually does so what is threat

91
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,040
modeling threat modeling is the process

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,080
of sort of thinking like an attacker and

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,060
figuring out all the different ways your

94
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,270
product can be broken and the effect of

95
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,550
breaking it in those different ways so

96
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,450
they're a bunch of different things that

97
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,850
feed into it and I'm gonna disgorge a

98
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,530
bunch of bulleted lists which will be

99
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,850
less useful than the following examples

100
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,900
but I think they'll help kind of

101
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,330
contextualise things so they're a bunch

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,100
of questions you will need to ask this

103
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,380
is a random small list of them who's

104
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,789
buying the product what is the things

105
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:49,060
supposed to do you kind of end up

106
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,070
identifying what possible problems can

107
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,070
exist and then identifying what what

108
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,050
risks are acceptable what sorts of

109
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,940
failures you don't care about and are

110
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,470
not worth fixing and then you probably

111
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,729
want to fix any other things you've

112
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,310
identified that you do care about and so

113
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,200
okay things that you can think about

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,700
when you're kind of thinking about how

115
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,220
to do some threat modeling stuff what

116
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,400
kinds of what kinds of prerequisites are

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,590
necessary for your product to be broken

118
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,380
into or attacked so do you need to be on

119
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,659
the same network last week of the week

120
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,280
before there were some people who

121
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,990
publish your research paper use

122
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,650
Lazer's to directly excite MEMS

123
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,660
microphones and smart home speakers so

124
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,040
is like you don't have to be physically

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,210
close by you don't have to be on the

126
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,710
same local network but you do need a

127
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,760
line of sight and a telescope probably

128
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,050
could you do it remotely is it connected

129
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,190
to the Internet do you need physical

130
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,050
access can you have momentary physical

131
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,670
access we like plug a flash drive into

132
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,860
an ATM or do you need extended physical

133
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,090
access where you can like rip the thing

134
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,000
apart and put it back together you can

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,160
kind of break down attackers into this

136
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,260
unit list graph it goes up into the

137
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,410
right so profits are good there's like

138
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,330
the casual I don't really I'm not paying

139
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,290
attention to your product I'm just

140
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,760
looking for things with this port open

141
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,770
type attacker and then there's the like

142
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,530
I'm gonna pay a little attention but I'm

143
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,810
not my whole life's goal is not breaking

144
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,000
into your thing then there's like my

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,470
life's goal is breaking into your thing

146
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,000
and then there's the times a thousand

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,860
version which is like the government

148
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,850
wants to make sure they get into your

149
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,500
house and they're gonna do whatever they

150
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,360
do use whatever resources they need to

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,390
be able to do that okay no one should

152
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,160
care about that again unless you're

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,200
you're building satellites for the

154
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,940
government you care about nation-state

155
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,400
actors but this isn't you're not

156
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,170
learning from this talk in that way

157
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,840
dedicated attackers maybe if you're

158
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,340
building a high profile thing if you're

159
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,600
like Nintendo and you want to make sure

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,030
people can't root the switch like okay

161
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,290
maybe that's sort of like a dedicated

162
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,820
attacker most of the time the thing you

163
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,650
actually want to care about the bar you

164
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,600
actually need to hit isn't someone

165
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,670
trying to wreck your product it's like

166
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,560
someone kind of casually bumping into it

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,820
and knocking it over because you've done

168
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,730
nothing at all which is the like

169
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,500
casually looking for vulnerabilities and

170
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,090
the like child with squirt gun level of

171
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,770
this is actually an immediately relevant

172
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,530
example which will come up later okay so

173
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,970
so what are some kinds of harm that

174
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,860
maybe a person could do if they break

175
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,720
your thing and they could cause fraud

176
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,280
either they could cause fraud to you by

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,630
getting something for free they could

178
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,090
cause fraud to others by causing them to

179
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,850
be billed for something or impersonating

180
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,080
them or something like that they could

181
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,450
hurt themselves physically hurt themself

182
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,570
they could physically hurt someone else

183
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,100
they could maybe it's possible that they

184
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,290
can like upload their own firmware but

185
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,880
all it would do is is brick their own

186
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,800
device okay so that's like harming

187
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
themself they could break your

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,770
infrastructure if they can use your

189
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,210
product as a beachhead to like climb

190
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,170
back up

191
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,150
lots of different possible ways that

192
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,860
they can cause damage so you can kind of

193
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,050
put in like a hierarchy of whoopsies

194
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,270
so there's like the oops they hurt

195
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,460
themselves oops they hurt other people

196
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,800
or they hurt you or oops they've harmed

197
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,170
everything more fire emojis is bad okay

198
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,330
so this was originally gonna be an even

199
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,010
longer list of random technical stuff

200
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,530
but that's not super engaging so I think

201
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,160
it'll be more interesting to talk about

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,260
sort of examples of like threat modeling

203
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,360
that I've done and the ways the problems

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,500
that we identified in the ways that we

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,690
chose to mitigate those things so the

206
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,220
three example devices are a weird

207
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,680
medical training device like an IOT

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,230
deadbolt for your home and one of those

209
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,690
IOT Dhokla electric scooters that you've

210
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,490
probably seen strewn around the slide

211
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,040
lock somewhere all the examples kind of

212
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,420
have the same format there's like what

213
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,760
the product is what the products goals

214
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,250
are which is a hierarchical list and

215
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,140
then what the risks were and what were

216
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,840
mitigated so first example is this

217
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,610
medical training device unfortunately

218
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,809
I'm not going to show you the exterior

219
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,400
because that would make it much easier

220
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,299
to figure out what it is

221
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,970
these are FCC photos though it's a

222
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,229
little battery powered Bluetooth device

223
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:50,290
and it was shaped it was a an IOT

224
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,140
syringe sort of it's find me later and I

225
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,820
can explain what it was actually for it

226
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,380
was a very strange device which had this

227
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,480
super cool like rigid flex PCB a

228
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,960
assembly it has a very specific use case

229
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,180
it's used for this one particular type

230
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,010
of training and nothing else it's

231
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,480
designed to be used with a very

232
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,760
elaborate setup in a training center not

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,390
at home it has a very small battery it's

234
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,980
very very limited in scope so the

235
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,890
product goals are like be good at doing

236
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,140
this training this isn't it's it's a

237
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,990
single purpose device so what what are

238
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,430
the risks there really aren't this is

239
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,350
like this is the sort of product where

240
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,780
security things were not a super

241
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,680
relevant concern you could take it okay

242
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,050
that's not really a I mean I guess you

243
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,300
could come up with some crazy DRM style

244
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,470
you can only use it while you're in the

245
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,210
building scheme but like okay so you

246
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,870
could steal it you could break it

247
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,340
physically snap it in half you could

248
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,200
update the firmware to make it do

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,520
something else

250
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,740
the point is this device is basically

251
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,339
useless it does this one thing it has no

252
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,500
other purpose and it would be really

253
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,589
hard to even force it to do some other

254
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,330
some other things the only kind of

255
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,950
relevant bit would be maybe from a

256
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,300
replacement there are a lot of games you

257
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,130
can play to try to prevent someone with

258
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,520
physical access from being able to

259
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,500
update firmware or open up a development

260
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,490
console or something

261
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,399
you can like potted in epoxy and you can

262
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,410
lock down the like programming headers

263
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,760
and stuff like that you can authenticate

264
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,560
firmware updates you can authenticate

265
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,140
and encrypt firmware updates we the only

266
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,910
thing that we did was we made it has a

267
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,959
Bluetooth radio but you could only

268
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,700
update it over USB but that was really

269
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,589
an engineering decision because we

270
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:30,970
didn't want to spend the time to do Oh

271
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,760
TA over Bluetooth it has Pleasant

272
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,770
security effects but that's that's it

273
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,959
and also this the FCC label this the

274
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,330
printed circuit board which is why this

275
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,990
is great okay that example very simple

276
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,600
kind of no security stuff this is an IOT

277
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,360
deadbolt it's not super obvious from

278
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,160
this picture but so that the product is

279
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,170
this bit over here and that over there

280
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,890
and then the little tongue thing this

281
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,770
was a really hilariously unbelievably

282
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,220
mechanically complicated product and

283
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,770
electrically complicated product with

284
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,490
one really big processor the same one in

285
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,170
some of the high-end teens he's like 160

286
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,350
mega Hertz cortex m4 whatever and two

287
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,690
other CPUs for doing radio stuff and a

288
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,709
radar and like all sorts of crazy things

289
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:22,660
it's a dead bolt it replaces the dead

290
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,279
bolt in your house unlike something like

291
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,839
an August lock which goes over your

292
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,880
normal lock this does not this entirely

293
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,270
replaces your normal lock so this is the

294
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,790
like sole governor of access through

295
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,050
whatever that point is that it's

296
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,200
installed so it's very sensitive in

297
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,240
certain ways it's battery-powered it

298
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,890
actually has multiple batteries as like

299
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,110
a backup it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

300
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,089
radios it connects to your phone you can

301
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,680
share access to all sorts of exotic

302
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
things so product goals are like if it

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,500
fails catastrophically it is absolutely

304
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,089
possible that you would be prevented

305
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,829
from getting into your house so like do

306
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,449
not allow that to happen under any

307
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,370
circumstances and then the follow-up is

308
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,810
like be really great it was very

309
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,529
expensive

310
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,659
because it was very complicated so part

311
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,309
of one of the ways to justify that is

312
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,989
like making it really good so it needs

313
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:11,139
to like be really smooth okay so like it

314
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,659
has its own network connection you get

315
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,249
physical access not only do you get

316
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,019
physical access like over a limited time

317
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,239
you get long-term physical access

318
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,829
someone can just show up at the door of

319
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,499
your house and then they have access

320
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,899
until someone tell them to leave if

321
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,629
you're using it the Airbnb someone a

322
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,609
stranger has unrestricted physical

323
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:32,049
access that it looks like they're

324
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,299
supposed to have they can totally remove

325
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,979
it from your door and do whatever they

326
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,719
want to it and put it back together like

327
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,029
the the most unrestricted physical

328
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,859
access you can possibly imagine so there

329
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,439
are a lot of risks there are a bunch of

330
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,149
privacy implications because it has a

331
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,279
lot of sensors in it and you could use

332
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,929
it to tell when someone is home or not

333
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,369
home you could use it to tell when

334
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,929
someone is home and near the door and

335
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:53,649
the lights were off

336
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,419
you can like all sorts of interesting

337
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,789
things you can it's designed to be used

338
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,829
to allow you to give access to people so

339
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,769
that's a thing if you can like put to

340
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,419
the on the exterior you can actually

341
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,859
grab it and rotate it and enter like

342
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:08,829
combo lock style pin codes so if you can

343
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,779
like inject a pin code in there you

344
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,699
could use that to get into a house if

345
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,619
you can reach in and just ask it to

346
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,179
unlock you could use that to get into a

347
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:19,299
house there are a million ways you can

348
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,989
you can deny access through it if it if

349
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:25,029
it bricks due to a bad update then

350
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:25,959
that's it

351
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,899
you can't get into your house if the

352
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,579
battery is dead you can't get into your

353
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:33,519
house if it can't connect to them if it

354
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,720
can't connect to certain kinds of

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,119
network control that could be hard if

356
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,009
you can make it break itself which is it

357
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,779
is mechanically capable of doing then

358
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,970
you can't get into your house or out of

359
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,489
your house there like a million a

360
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,369
million different ways so we and I I

361
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,689
cannot take credit for all this stuff

362
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,879
this was a project which existed before

363
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,499
I got there a lot of engineering work

364
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,729
had been done before I got there so I

365
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,649
did some of this but not all of it

366
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,629
we mitigated I think a reasonable number

367
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,059
of things a lot of that was sort of as

368
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,559
an artifact of the architecture of the

369
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,239
product so there are bunch of just

370
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,499
quickly going through things to prevent

371
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,379
access there are a lot of electronics in

372
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,669
it the electronics were physically

373
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,769
located on the interior of the lock for

374
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,949
the most part so if you shattered the

375
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,300
glass on the outside and

376
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,490
got to the PCB a that was behind it

377
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,020
there was not really a lot there that

378
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,630
you could exploit and it was designed

379
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,340
with hardened steel so you could and

380
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,480
this is testing they did they like

381
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,730
sledge-hammered it with like a giant

382
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,470
test rig to make sure that if you

383
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,490
sledgehammer it it you couldn't

384
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,410
sledgehammer it off the door basically

385
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,500
or if you did it wouldn't cause the

386
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,210
house to become unlocked there's and

387
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,440
there's a whole like test regime for

388
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,700
lock hardness and stuff which they

389
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,220
applied the rate limits for some of the

390
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,200
messaging stuff there was a mechanical

391
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,490
release on the interior that didn't

392
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,170
require any battery power or the lock to

393
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,150
be working at all so you could get out

394
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,850
even it was totally dead there is a

395
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,280
secondary battery which is used to allow

396
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,720
you to get in if the primary battery is

397
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,280
totally dead and it only wakes up when

398
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,600
you physically press a button which

399
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,920
requires you to physically be at the

400
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,420
lock so even if you could remotely reach

401
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,190
in and do something to cause it to die

402
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,170
that battery would still not be harmed

403
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,060
at the end of the day though it's still

404
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,470
all the things I said before you're

405
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,690
still giving potentially unrestricted

406
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,680
physical access to this thing so you can

407
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,360
rip it apart install a hardware implant

408
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,850
I don't see Joe Fitz here but he can

409
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,580
tell us all about that at some point it

410
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,930
was just not worth there was it was not

411
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,900
reasonable to continue mitigating things

412
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,820
okay so pin code stuff it had a serial

413
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,440
console we turned that off this is like

414
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,530
the the the most obvious things and we

415
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,910
were using a kinetise part which has

416
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,030
these really cool magic bytes you could

417
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,410
write in flash which is sort of like

418
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,080
soft fuse that JTAG in the swd off so

419
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,890
you didn't have to do it as a

420
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,570
manufacturing step that was irreversible

421
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,880
so you could later come and basically

422
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,970
play magic a magic certificate into it

423
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,650
and it would like turn its debug headers

424
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,390
back on but normally in the field you

425
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,860
couldn't plug into it and dump anything

426
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,000
out of it

427
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,260
it also had a big table of pin codes and

428
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,140
a big table of like timestamps and

429
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,240
things which governed when certain pin

430
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,350
codes were active and when certain

431
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,580
people could have access and things like

432
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,400
that so there was more of that data than

433
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,140
we wanted to store in the main flash of

434
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,750
the part both in terms of Flash wear so

435
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,920
that we didn't wear the part out and

436
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,170
also because it was just like physically

437
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,690
a lot of it so we stored it in an

438
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,390
external flash chip there's sort of a

439
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,950
risk when you do that though you take

440
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,630
the thing apart it's not that hard to

441
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,910
like look at the parts on the PCB a and

442
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,780
try to find

443
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,090
like an or flash and then plug into it

444
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,710
and just speaks bye to it and get it to

445
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,380
dump all of its secrets so we had to

446
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,660
encrypt all that so we sort of treated

447
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,520
the main microcontrollers flash as the

448
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,220
like route of trust we considered it to

449
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,120
be in violet what's the word sealed

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,950
perfectly sealed once we've done all the

451
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,510
other flash lockdown stuff we sort of

452
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,770
got to the point where you would have to

453
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,930
like decap the part and inspect it to

454
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,950
get data out of it which we've

455
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,960
determined was acceptable again if you

456
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,640
think of the like curve of attack or

457
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,590
hardness someone kind of randomly

458
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,360
casually trying to break into this thing

459
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,220
or even leave a hardware implant is not

460
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,349
gonna be decamping the eye sees to try

461
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,359
to read out the flash so that was

462
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,959
acceptable so we we used symmetric

463
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,060
crypto AES specifically which was

464
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,150
accelerated by our CPU the main crypto

465
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,180
key was generated in the the main CPU in

466
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,939
lock and never at any point left it just

467
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,560
happened to the factory silently and

468
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,630
then that was used to transparently

469
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,710
encrypt all the stuff on the on the part

470
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,640
there are three second interesting

471
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,130
explanation of cryptography stuff so

472
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,020
there's symmetric and again I am NOT a

473
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,560
security expert so I symmetric crypto

474
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,780
asymmetric crypto they're useful for

475
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,670
different things symmetric crypto is is

476
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,570
nice because it's it it's easy to find

477
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,890
microcontrollers and stuff that have

478
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,780
hardware support for accelerating it

479
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,160
it's great for encrypting like all the

480
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,510
blocks in a flash device things like

481
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,810
that

482
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,820
asymmetric crypto is cool because you

483
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,400
can do things like construct public

484
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,750
private key pairs which let you validate

485
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,430
that messages came from who you expect

486
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,170
and then certificate chains which allow

487
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,120
you to to certify that like this matches

488
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,470
come from someone you trust comes from

489
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,790
someone you trust comes from someone you

490
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,220
trust so it sort of ends up being a

491
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,020
rapper a rapper of a couple layers of

492
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,440
things Oh TA this is a device with a

493
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,610
bunch of firmware the firmware is pretty

494
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,860
complicated so it could be updated

495
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,680
you could you could OTA it we decided

496
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,690
that we weren't gonna do any Wi-Fi OTA

497
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,670
the only way to OTA was over bluetooth

498
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,320
because that guaranteed that you were

499
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,140
physically close to the device and more

500
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,720
than forcing Bluetooth we would only a

501
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,730
the lock only allowed you to pour

502
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,670
updates into it when it was unlocked and

503
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,080
the door was open so we could actually

504
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,690
tell where the door was relative to the

505
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,760
strike plate on the frame so

506
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,680
we could tell if it was totally we would

507
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,300
we could tell if the door was positioned

508
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,400
closed or positioned partially closed or

509
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,490
open so this way if an update really did

510
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,620
go catastrophic ly wrong and the lock

511
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,440
totally died we could guarantee that you

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,790
were not gonna be in a state where you

513
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,200
were locked inside your house even there

514
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,100
was the mechanical release and

515
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,870
everything but as an additional layer we

516
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,610
could like say that strongly and that

517
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,310
was that was good we did asymmetric and

518
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,800
symmetric crypto so we authenticated

519
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,510
that the updates were from the backend

520
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,250
infrastructure and then we encrypted the

521
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,660
updates themselves the process for

522
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,830
handling those certificates was very

523
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,720
careful there's like they were

524
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,550
hand-delivered to the factory and they

525
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,470
were the only limited number of people

526
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,170
had access to the like route most key

527
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,940
that was used to create all the

528
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,770
successive keys below that says like a

529
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,180
lot of physical security stuff related

530
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,170
to that remote access and being

531
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,390
compelled to unlock the house there was

532
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,860
a lot of very elaborate crypto stuff

533
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,780
between the individual lock and the

534
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,340
individual app on your phone that

535
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,610
allowed messages to pass to be encrypted

536
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,980
end-to-end between the lock and whatever

537
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,750
device you're using to unlock it so no

538
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,890
none of the back-end infrastructure

539
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,250
could see into it it's worth noting

540
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,020
though that you can make a bunch of

541
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,250
really strong statements about being

542
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,170
intend encrypted and not be lying but if

543
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,940
you're if the device is designed to

544
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,700
accept firmer updates from whatever

545
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,380
company and you can't inspect the

546
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,670
firmware updates where you choose not to

547
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,920
it might be end-to-end encrypted but

548
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,450
nothing prevents the company from

549
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,370
pushing a firmware down a firmer image

550
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,650
down which either makes it not be

551
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,470
end-to-end encrypted or just inspects

552
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,180
the messages when they come out of the

553
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,410
crypto pipe so like if if someone really

554
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,240
did force the company to unlock a lock

555
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,650
there was not something a customer could

556
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,600
do to guarantee that like that didn't

557
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,650
happen okay so on to devices which can

558
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,700
oh sorry

559
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,740
before I forget I mentioned that kid

560
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,840
with its squirt gun so this lock is it's

561
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,790
waterproof on the outside because it

562
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,170
would be really bad if a kid with a

563
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,430
squirt gun squirted the lock and that

564
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,440
killed it that would be a really

565
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,330
disappointing form of denial of access

566
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,850
okay so IOT electric scooters these are

567
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,710
random scooters I do not mean to imply

568
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,420
that these are or are not scooters that

569
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,820
worked on I did work on one of the ones

570
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,210
that you see around though so the

571
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,640
premise of these devices for background

572
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,140
information is there on the side of the

573
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,060
road usually like scan a QR code and the

574
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,800
scooter will unlock and disengage some

575
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,120
sort of software break and then you can

576
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,860
ride the scooter around they're powered

577
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,590
they have a big battery they're fun when

578
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,120
you're done using them usually pay by

579
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,420
minute plus some flat fare you like lock

580
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,640
them up and check out of them in the app

581
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,490
and they get returned to the fleet you

582
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,280
can like find them on your phone the one

583
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
the relevant one that I worked on for

584
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,240
this was based on the ES for chassis

585
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,650
which is made by a company called mind

586
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,290
bug segue which is an exceptionally

587
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,960
common chassis ninebot is the Chinese

588
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
company that bought the Segway brand

589
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,380
they build the little Segway thing they

590
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,060
built almost all of the scooters that

591
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,770
you see on the street and these

592
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,430
particularly are ps4s they move really

593
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,110
fast they have really big batteries they

594
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,540
are cool unlike the medical training

595
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,060
device which is not cool these are

596
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,530
obviously useful because you look at

597
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,030
this and you're like yeah I would love a

598
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,960
cool scooter

599
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,910
unlike the medical training device which

600
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,440
no one is like oh yeah syringe for

601
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,280
simulated medical training

602
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,410
that's not no one cares about that but

603
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,940
these are like cool they have Wi-Fi

604
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,650
radios they have cell radios a bluetooth

605
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,030
they've GPS is like all sorts of good

606
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,110
stuff and they're designed to be shared

607
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,780
between users so product goals again do

608
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,060
not harm the user these are actually

609
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,820
dangerous in like a very tangible

610
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,230
conspicuous way provide the best user

611
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,210
experience because they're all they're

612
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,920
all basically priced the same it's all

613
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,650
like a dollar plus five cents a minute

614
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,510
or 15 cents a minute or something and

615
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,150
then maybe make money but you know the

616
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,830
carrot the company that did this and all

617
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,880
of the companies as far as I can tell

618
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,710
don't making money it's like a very

619
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,950
tertiary sort of goal that'll come up

620
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,630
later in how we mitigated some problems

621
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,030
so I swear it's relevant ok so there's

622
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,320
like a lot of possible harms here

623
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,340
product is cool

624
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,950
everyone gets physical access and unlike

625
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,110
the lock I mean if someone was like

626
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,490
standing outside of your house for four

627
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,960
hours with a bunch of tools playing with

628
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,190
your door lock maybe a neighbor would

629
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,160
care these are like these are like

630
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,540
recreationally trashed they're like

631
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,980
they're designed so that you can pick

632
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,330
them up and walk around with them

633
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,070
there's like no one cares at all people

634
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,990
will laugh and take funny videos of you

635
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,220
playing with them so like

636
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,230
the most unattended physical access no

637
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,630
contract or agreement of any kind you

638
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,280
can hurt yourself you can hurt others

639
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,840
you can remotely hurt others because

640
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,640
it's a giant electrically powered

641
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,470
wheeled vehicle with the motorist is

642
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,850
like all the good all the good fire

643
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,740
emojis in here okay

644
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,539
so the set of stuff that we identified

645
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,090
and tried to fix there's a bunch of

646
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,620
safety concerns they have brakes the

647
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,600
brakes can fail you can have throttle

648
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,159
failures which are can either be bad

649
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,780
because you accelerate forever or bad

650
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,799
because you're in the middle of an

651
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,419
intersection on a hill and suddenly you

652
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,500
can't get out of the intersection

653
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,150
there's a bunch of privacy implications

654
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,179
because hands a radio and a GPS and it

655
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,830
knows who on it who's on it and it has a

656
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,690
Bluetooth radios like look around and

657
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,760
see what's near it and there's all sorts

658
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,190
of possible fraud there's like getting

659
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,059
free access to rise stealing the scooter

660
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,320
all sorts of great stuff John I have

661
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,970
service you can destroy the scooter

662
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,830
during an update you can rip the brain

663
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,480
out of the scooter and replace it you

664
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,710
can rip the brain of the scooter and not

665
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,419
replace it and just take the scooter you

666
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,039
can destroy the scooter recreationally

667
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,900
you can cut the brake lines that you can

668
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,640
pull the wheels off it you can pop the

669
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,690
tires though I don't think anyone's

670
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,100
stupid enough to have pneumatic tires at

671
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,690
this point so we mitigated some of this

672
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,299
and not others I'm not gonna talk about

673
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,640
the privacy stuff that I think for our

674
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,830
purposes is mostly a back-end concern

675
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,590
the short answer for privacy is all all

676
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,059
of the communication went through the

677
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,409
cell radio directly to the company

678
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,100
back-end it was wrapped in crypto brake

679
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,799
failure throttle control and stuff we

680
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,020
took a lot of steps to mitigate both

681
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,210
risks in terms of product safety and

682
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,710
risks in terms of like security

683
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,510
vulnerability related product safety we

684
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,190
there's no mitigation for the user being

685
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,789
an idiot fraud and theft we mitigated

686
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,919
some of we didn't mitigate others coz

687
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,750
the end of the day it's gonna be sitting

688
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,159
on the road and people can pick it up

689
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,590
and use it so safe o TAS we didn't they

690
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,270
had to be updated we had to ship them

691
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,159
like months before we thought we were

692
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,020
done with them so like they had to be

693
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,360
updated they have Wi-Fi radios they have

694
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,890
cell radios there's no technical reason

695
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,230
why you can't Ogier them we just didn't

696
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,600
because that was a big can of worms in

697
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,580
terms of like reliability and recovery

698
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,760
and a big can of worms in terms of

699
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,559
engineering complexity and we like

700
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,600
weren't going to touch any of that so

701
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,640
these devices are interesting because

702
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,630
the company

703
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,390
that produce them do a bunch of fleet

704
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,910
management and it is I assume all of

705
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,220
them do this they either pay people or

706
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,190
they like employ people who drive vans

707
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,230
who go and physically go to the scooters

708
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,120
and pick them up every night and inspect

709
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,200
them to make sure that they're still

710
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,330
mechanically sound and take them to a

711
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,770
warehouse and maybe they charge them or

712
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,730
they're paying someone else to charge

713
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,740
them things like that so instead of

714
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,020
doing o TAS over the air we did OTAs by

715
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,490
having the like fleet there's a word

716
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,960
shoot and in the name of those employees

717
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,300
but by having the employees whose job it

718
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,980
was to like service the scooter is the

719
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,890
text I guess updated themselves by

720
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,720
physically like opening it and plugging

721
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,000
into it and not just that allowed us to

722
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,090
basically use money to totally eliminate

723
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,300
an entire class of problems so that was

724
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,980
kind of an interesting they were already

725
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,180
gonna do it it was like an interesting

726
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,440
thing we could exploit and we exploded

727
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,510
it in a couple times again I mentioned

728
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,040
the physics the scooters were physically

729
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,390
inspected before they were put back into

730
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,630
the field so if there was something

731
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,540
obviously like attached to the PCB a the

732
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,850
people inspecting it would know that you

733
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,190
can play a lot of games to again to make

734
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,830
it either tamper evident or tamper

735
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,480
resistant either by potting the whole

736
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,860
thing in epoxy which is my favorite

737
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,500
solution to all problems or including

738
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,630
really elaborate anti-tamper like photo

739
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,790
sensors to measure if the case has been

740
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,970
opened and send a message or like

741
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,500
distance sensors and things to see if

742
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,030
the cases physically come off the top

743
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,770
Hall effect sensors and embedded mannix

744
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,230
magnets you can do like wire meshes

745
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,030
embedded in the plastic that Detective

746
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,110
that broke it you can do all this stuff

747
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,450
that was totally not worth it again

748
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,720
company is expecting that these are

749
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,560
consumable they're expecting that these

750
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,790
scooters are gonna disappear and they're

751
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,920
gonna require serious service so we

752
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,840
didn't care that was all totally

753
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,400
acceptable there was there was just a

754
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,020
number which was the number of scooters

755
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,610
the company was expecting to lose and

756
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,280
that was fine that was it we like didn't

757
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,110
that was that would the end of that that

758
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,610
path we didn't have to mitigate anymore

759
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,400
I mentioned all the calm stuff went

760
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,200
through the cell radio we can talk about

761
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,020
what spoofing cell networks that was not

762
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,250
something we were worried about all the

763
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,380
handshaking stuff all happened through

764
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,970
sign messaging with the back end

765
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,090
whatever out of scope for this breaking

766
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,590
throttle so these scooters are

767
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,070
interesting

768
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,080
for a variety of reasons and this on the

769
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,080
left is a shell me and 365 the M 365 is

770
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,390
made by an iPod segue and white labeled

771
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,980
by Xiaomi in this case I guess literally

772
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,440
white labeled and the m36 5 is a great

773
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,870
scooter and it's really well built it

774
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,170
has some interesting traits one of them

775
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,360
is that it has a real it has a real disc

776
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,730
brake so it's like a real

777
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,690
honest-to-goodness disc brake with a

778
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,550
cable which can be cut which is

779
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,470
unfortunate but that goes to like a

780
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,330
mechanical brake handle at the top so

781
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,380
you're riding the scooter you have a

782
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,790
throttle which does throttle and you a

783
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,310
brake and the brake mechanically engages

784
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,450
that caliper in the back and everything

785
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,590
the M or sorry the es4 does not the s4

786
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,780
has one motor in the front and it has

787
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,060
like the the kick scooter or stomp brake

788
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,100
in the back but it has a throttle on the

789
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,840
brake up top the throttle works like a

790
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,900
throttle the brake doesn't the brake

791
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,480
basically turns the regen way up so it

792
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,550
doesn't actually have a physical

793
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,110
mechanical brake that you can rely on

794
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,170
and that is really really scary it's

795
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,970
scary because we observed a bunch of

796
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,440
these things destroy themself when you

797
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,330
rode them down at all hill and braked

798
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,770
the whole time and you weighed more than

799
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,990
like a hundred pounds we watched we had

800
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,810
motors literally like melt a part in the

801
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,320
wheel but it's also scary because you

802
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,970
know if you're going down a hill and

803
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,930
you're about to hit an intersection you

804
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,120
need to stop you're gonna hit the brake

805
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,640
and the brake will hopefully work you're

806
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,070
not gonna remember to hit the to hit the

807
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,930
like stomp brake you're gonna freak out

808
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,060
and probably ditch and that's really

809
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,190
really scary from a product safety

810
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,850
perspective so again we solve this

811
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,710
partially with with the application of

812
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,030
money there were people who physically

813
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,800
inspected all these scooters every night

814
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,180
before they went back out so they could

815
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,050
physically look at the scooter and see

816
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,580
if like the brake was still attached and

817
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,800
would probably still work they emitted a

818
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,270
bunch of Health metrics related to how

819
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,370
many miles they they'd had put on them

820
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,840
how many chart cycles things like that

821
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,940
um the real mitigation though was that

822
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,190
we had a we put a whole second

823
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,870
microcontroller on the board and the

824
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,240
second microcontroller was the only

825
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,890
responsible party for all the throttle

826
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,420
and brake stuff so there's actually the

827
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,090
way these scooters work there are two

828
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,400
controllers on them so there's a sort of

829
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,170
an ECU on the bottom that does battery

830
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,880
charge stuff as well

831
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,490
as it is the speed control it does motor

832
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,830
control stuff and it talks to a micro up

833
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,430
at the top

834
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,650
the s4 works the same way all the

835
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,730
electronics in the battery and stuff is

836
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,830
in the stem motors in the bottom and

837
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,720
then there's a second board in the in

838
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,480
the very top so we replace those like

839
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,820
the brain the brain which is what

840
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,020
normally has the Bluetooth radio in the

841
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,920
UI and things so in our replacement we

842
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,360
have up the big microcontroller with the

843
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,530
cell radio and everything and then we

844
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,540
had a totally separate microcontroller

845
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,100
which was connected to the main

846
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
microcontroller through a UART which

847
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,330
spoke a very narrow set of comm stuff

848
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,280
that we defined and that's it you

849
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,670
couldn't it couldn't be updated and you

850
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,410
couldn't tell it what throttle or brake

851
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,100
position to set but it's whole job was

852
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,050
to read the analog throttle and brake

853
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,210
signals and send those messages down to

854
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,520
the ECU so if something happens in the

855
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,500
main micro if it got wedged in a crazy

856
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,520
way if some network thing timed out and

857
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,910
somehow a thread got jammed I something

858
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,320
goes totally crazy that was fine

859
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,330
you could still continue riding it there

860
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,770
was a heartbeat so he could it could

861
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,530
detect if one of the micros got totally

862
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,780
hung and was no longer responsive there

863
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,090
was some pretty elaborate sort of sanity

864
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,430
checking that happened from the ADCs so

865
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,290
we were detecting things like wires

866
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,200
being pinched and shorted a DC's being

867
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,090
disconnected and dust like the current

868
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,440
draw falling off all sorts of things

869
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,550
like that so that physically separated

870
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,380
like remote access to the throttle and

871
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,820
the brake and also improved safety stuff

872
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,500
theft this is a fun a fun side effect so

873
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,550
I pulled this picture because it's just

874
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,200
a picture at the top of the scooter that

875
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,140
picture came from this cool Amazon page

876
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,460
there's a weird mixture of keywords here

877
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,460
head stock handlebar firmware handle kit

878
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,760
for es to handle replacement part it's

879
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,410
like ok so it's these plastic parts

880
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,710
pictures of plastic parts that's cool if

881
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,790
you look down there's this question why

882
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,470
not compatible with shared scooters hi

883
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,270
head stock handlebar firmware is

884
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,710
compatible with shared scooters like

885
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,830
bird line lift and skip so when these

886
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,380
companies deploy these scooters there's

887
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,670
some amount of customization that goes

888
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,740
on but not that much and it turns out in

889
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
a lot of cases you can take the scooter

890
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,740
and you can rip there

891
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,770
ran off it and you can buy a totally

892
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,460
off-the-shelf

893
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,059
either manufacturer like om part or

894
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,070
replacement drop-in part and just

895
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,090
reinstall that in the top of the scooter

896
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,530
exactly where it came from and like

897
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,420
magic the bird scooter becomes your

898
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,730
scooter can replace any other stuffs

899
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,920
like that is like obviously a real thing

900
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,580
you can go to Amazon and buy for $7 an

901
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,340
entire replacement like PCB a button

902
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,990
assembly thing that you can stick into

903
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,400
one of these scooters to turn it back

904
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,410
into a dumb scooter as there is like

905
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,860
real demand for this kind of product

906
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,350
kind of product is the right word and

907
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,460
this is an example of why the theft

908
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,750
stuff was not it was it was like a

909
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,550
business case to write down it was not

910
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,720
something that we were gonna be able to

911
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,250
effectively mitigate because these were

912
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,460
people who were relatively targeted in

913
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,570
their hike in their desire to use the

914
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,760
scooter for their own purposes so I

915
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,500
guess the point here is that that wasn't

916
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,830
theirs there were technical moments but

917
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,420
it was not really I would argue it's

918
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,220
more of a social problem than it is a

919
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,470
technical problem to hit to hit a

920
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,750
reasonable bar not to be NSA proof

921
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,150
that's a whole nother can of worms but

922
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,490
it's it to cross the threshold where

923
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,040
it's hard for someone to casually say

924
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,870
brick your entire fleet of scooters

925
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,400
because they can just bow ta them

926
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,020
because you didn't bother checking to

927
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,280
see if the updates were coming from

928
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,600
someone you trust and you didn't bother

929
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,860
making sure the updates were coming from

930
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,370
someone who is physically nearby so like

931
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,010
step zero is pay attention turns out if

932
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,720
you care about making security stuff

933
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,630
better Wow incredible you'll do better

934
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,020
than people who don't care at all and

935
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,520
then the process is identify problems

936
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,260
that might exist figure out what the

937
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,210
business is willing to accept in terms

938
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,850
of risk and damage and then don't fix

939
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,980
anything else like fix fix the things

940
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,580
that you care about

941
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,950
do not spend energy fixing things you

942
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,190
don't care about so I'm Kerry and this

943
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,920
has been basic device security for basic

944
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,390
needs thanks

945
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,709
[Applause]
