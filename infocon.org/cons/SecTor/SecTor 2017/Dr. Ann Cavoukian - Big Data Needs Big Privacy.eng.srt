14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to security crowds because</font>

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,040
sometimes there's confusion as to what

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,810
privacy is how it relates to security

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,300
are they one on the same or they

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:06,189
distinct and i hope to clarify that for

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,830
you today needless to say i'm a big fan

20
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:11,350
of security because as you here very

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,490
shortly you can't have good privacy

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:17,408
without strong security let me walk you

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,320
through what I'm going to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font>

24
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:22,840
today I always like to start with what

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,509
privacy is and more importantly what it

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,040
is not because whenever I have a captive

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,320
audience I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of</font>

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the confusion that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be</font>

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with this topic and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">just found this user data manifesto they</font>

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,199
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the EU we're going to talk</font>

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be telling</font>

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,740
you about privacy by design this is

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">something i developed it's a framework</font>

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:50,979
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i developed a long time ago back in</font>

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,920
the late 90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its really taken off</font>

37
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,840
and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to you why that is and</font>

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in which it has been</font>

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,689
operationalized in a number of distinct

40
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,280
application areas then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

41
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,520
talk about something having to do with

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,799
big data there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of confusion as</font>

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,709
to whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can have data analytics</font>

44
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:13,840
and privacy and i hope to clarify that

45
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,420
as well and of course

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,819
it wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good talk if I didn't</font>

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch on the Internet of Things some</font>

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,190
trouble down the road so it would be

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,709
great if we could avoid that let's talk

56
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,810
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy so privacy</font>

57
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,980
subsumes a much broader set of

58
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,549
protections than security alone but if

59
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,548
you don't lead with strong security you

60
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:57,069
will never have good privacy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply</font>

61
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,940
cannot have privacy without a base of

62
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,679
strong security it's critical and

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,160
especially this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and age where cyber</font>

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,860
attacks are just abounding it is

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,489
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> essential that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure</font>

66
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,310
this strong base but I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> return to</font>

67
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,980
privacy just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a moment and try to</font>

68
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,170
dispel some myths that are out there a

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,238
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confusion as to what privacy is</font>

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,298
in it is not here's what it's not

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,819
privacy does not equal secrecy it's not

72

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> having something to hide it drives</font>

73

you have nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fear right long that</font>

liberty is about you're a law-abiding

80

information you choose to share and with

whom that's the essence of privacy it's

83
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,599
about control it's all about personal

in their constitution<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1983 and it is</font>

no accident that Germany is the leading

information about everybody else though

137
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,919
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was such a culture of fear</font>

everybody's looking over the shoulder

nobody knew who was saying what to whom

140
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:38,429
and how it could impact their lives and

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just he said it makes you shrink you</font>

it kills innovation creativity because

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,070
you're so fearful i always say it

145
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,930
shrinks your cognitive bandwidth<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people call it a panopticon some people</font>

call it a veil of surveillance

150
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,710
everything else is impacted so when you

151
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about the kind of measures I'm</font>

prosperous and allowed to do blueSky

158
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,830
thinking all of this requires privacy

159
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:29,850
and moments of review no<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigorous</font>

without fear of reprisal the user data

162
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,919
manifesto was put out by a group in

Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a European led effort and</font>

164
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,160
what I loved about this and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring to your attention is it resonated</font>

166
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,570
with my notion of control and they

167
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about the importance three core</font>

user data rights that relate to control

170
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,260
used i'll be talking about that in the

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,600
context of transparency and again

172
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,610
freedom of choice in this context

173
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,830
freedom to choose the platform that they

hope to use there's the link if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

any interested in taking a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

176
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,480
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it converges very well</font>

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,710
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work that I'm going to</font>

put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your radar the oecd developed</font>

181
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,390
what are called Fair Information

182
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,720
practices these are the principles many

183
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,600
years ago 1980 they did a refresh in

184
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,510
2013 just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure do they still</font>

185
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:40,200
apply in this day and age and they

186
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,580
decided absolutely they do and it's I'm

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,400
not going to go through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these in</font>

188
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:49,110
great detail but<font color="#CCCCCC"> suffice it to say it's</font>

189
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,100
all about when you collect information

190
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,050
from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual</font>

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,790
don't collect information for any

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,949
purpose to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the heck you want</font>

193
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,579
with it people give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you information for</font>

00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">a particular purpose so if your Amazon I</font>

with it cetera all of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

200
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,500
is for a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose and the</font>

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,989
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collection of limitation and</font>

202
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,410
purpose specification use limitation is

203
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,569
all about limiting the uses of the

204
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,800
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> primary purpose for</font>

which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data were collected</font>

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,819
restricting your use of the information

207
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:29,860
to that purpose and then once you

208
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:32,860
complete that purpose you don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other purposes unless you have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the consent of the individual called the</font>

211
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:42,490

212
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:44,500
uses of data without the consent of the

214
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,519
this is foreign but as you know this

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,680
abounds online when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the</font>

happening secondary uses are probably

218
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,089
more than norm than anything else and

219
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,029
you're going to see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of push back</font>

220
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,380
to this from the European Union<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

221
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:11,019
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about them in a moment</font>

222
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:13,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they recently invalidated an</font>

223
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:20,680
agreement that had been struck in about

224
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:24,149
the year 2000 with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US the EU has in</font>

225
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,709
the late 90s I had a data directive that

226
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,810
they put in place very strong privacy

227
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,138
laws reflecting these principles and

228
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,899
they said any data that flows outside of

229
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:38,199
the EU on EU citizens let's say going to

230
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:41,230
companies in the US there's got to be

231
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,689
some agreement in place because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

232
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:48,310
the laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US were not considered</font>

233
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:51,550
to be adequate from a European point of

234
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,768
view there was no adequacy with the EU

235
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,240
data directive so they struck this

236
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,180
agreement called safe harbor and

237
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,600
basically it was that companies in the

238
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,099
US could voluntarily say yes we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sign up for this and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

240
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,170
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow the</font>

241
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,839
the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the law in the EU</font>

242
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,729
and about four to five thousand

243
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,209
companies had signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up have signed up a</font>

244
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,730
long time ago the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently that</font>

245
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,638
arose and on october the sixth this was

246
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,519
invalidated by the EU Court of Justice

247
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,399
this was huge huge devastating impact on

248
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,759
companies in the US the reason it was

249
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,870
invalidated was because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

250
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,910
revelations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European Union</font>

251
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,120
Court of Justice learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result of</font>

252
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,730
Edward Snowden's revelations prism etc

253
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,310
the massive state of surveillance taking

254
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,399
place in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. that would also impact</font>

255
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,719
EU citizens so long way of saying I

256
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,589
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even get into it here but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

257
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,000
into it so they decided we're going to

258
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,370
invalidate it and they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like this</font>

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,680
on October the six there is no longer a

260
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,990
safe harbor agreement in place so

261
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,120
companies in the US have been scrambling

262
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,779
as you might imagine to find some

263
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,149
alternate means of engaging continuing

264
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,459
to engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> in business with our customers</font>

265
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,529
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European Union so stay tuned on</font>

266
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:15,969
that there's no decision yet they're

267
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,309
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

268
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,059
binding corporate rules are being

269
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:24,399
considered model contracts but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

270
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,769
very thorny area now suffice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to say</font>

271
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,629
these principles are considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

272
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,480
extremely important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will be</font>

273
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">reflected in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any privacy laws that</font>

274
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,290
emanate from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EU and will expect to</font>

275
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,420
be respected in the US and elsewhere now

276
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,439
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch gears and I'm going</font>

277
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to you about something called</font>

278
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:47,620
privacy by design as I think was

279
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:52,209
mentioned I developed this long time ago

280
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:58,319
late 90s but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really taken off since</font>

281
00:12:52,209 --> 00:13:00,699
then actually right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine eleven I</font>

282
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,889
really started focusing on privacy by

283
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,579
design because what it's all about is

284
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:09,689
embedding privacy protective measures

285
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:13,089
proactively into the design of your IT

286
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:15,639
into the data architecture into the code

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you write making it an inherent</font>

this well what became abundantly clear

was that the system of regulatory

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,170

that it had to be privacy versus

<font color="#E5E5E5">not suggesting that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to elevate</font>

that's what I reject and that's a

00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,429
privacy by design is all about

343
00:15:54,579 --> 00:16:01,189
proactively identifying the privacy

344
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:03,559
risks and embedding the necessary

345
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:05,629
protections to mitigate those risks in a

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year privacy commissioners around the</font>

usually in Europe in 2010 it was in

Jerusalem and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,079
three-day four-day conference we have a

half day closed session where we vote on

standard a framework on which that

360
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,259
privacy and data protection should be

361
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:48,139
built and to my surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

unanimously passed by all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those in</font>

363
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:52,009
attendance at our meeting and I was

364
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">delighted the reason I was really</font>

365
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:58,220
surprised is because most commissioners

366
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,649
are sort of lawyers lawyers and love

367
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,619
looking at you know a law<font color="#E5E5E5"> and applying</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only one who's</font>

372
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,750
frustrated with the fact that the

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy and fractions</font>

were escaping our detection everybody

375
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:29,870
got it everybody was in the same boat

376
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:32,840
feeling unempowered because so much was

377
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,689
going beyond us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we knew this and I</font>

378
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,939
use an iceberg analogy that my fellow

<font color="#E5E5E5">commissioners and I felt that if we were</font>

seeing the tip of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iceberg in terms</font>

of all the data breaches and privacy

these were remaining largely unknown to

us undetected unchallenged because they

weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming forward so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

another system we had to have a

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,410
proactive system think of a model of

388
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,350
prevention much like a medical model

389
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:11,200
could you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unthinkable going</font>

390
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,530
to your doctor and he takes some tasks

391
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
and he says yeah you've got cancer we're

392
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it develops and</font>

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,290
then if it gets worse you know we'll

394
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,150
offer you some chemo I mean what an

395
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,610
unthinkable proposition I want it to be

396
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,100
equally unthinkable that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ola would</font>

397
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,770
allow privacy harms to fester and grow

398
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,260
and develop when you can prevent them

399
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,450
right at the outset this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

400
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,390
prevention that's what I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

401
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,380
aspire to and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had great success</font>

402
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,970
with privacy by design since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

403
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,040
passed as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> international standard</font>

404
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,820
around the world it's been translated to

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">37 languages and not a week would go by</font>

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,030
when I was Commissioner that some

colleague from some jurisdiction

408
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,050
wouldn't contact me to tell me about

409
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,330
what was taking place and their

410
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,030
jurisdiction and recent developments and

411
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,649
what they were doing this is privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

surprisingly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States the</font>

418
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,360
around 2011 they declared privacy by

419

design to be the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three best</font>

companies on public sector now let me

focus again on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle at the power</font>

of and getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of privacy versus</font>

have both it's so important and let me

<font color="#E5E5E5">assure you this is the traditional</font>

430
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,830
consists of unnecessary trade-offs and

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,260
false dichotomies and that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

433
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:10,810
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important takeaway i</font>

434
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:13,240
recently had an exchange with michael

435
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,310
chertoff michael chertoff was the second

436
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,000
secretary in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States Secretary</font>

437
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:22,179
of Homeland Security so obviously like

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,860
big into security and since then he's

439
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,270
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a company called the chair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Toth</font>

440
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,169
group and he does a lot of security

441
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:31,090
pursuits and he wrote a great excuse me

442
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,730
our great article that appeared in The

443
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,740
Huffington Post and he was saying that

444
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,350
he was really sick and tired of people

445
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that it was privacy versus</font>

446
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,959
security that it was this trade-off

447
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,840
between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and he was</font>

448
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,480
saying look you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

449
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,639
security for privacy you can't have

450
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,370
privacy without security and he was

451
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,550
saying I get very tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

452
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,219
thinking of this as either are as one of

453
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,909
the other so I was delighted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

454
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,670
that because I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a person who</font>

455
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,380
reaches many people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I emailed him and</font>

456
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,630
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just applauded the position he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

457
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,900
taking and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with him for many</font>

458
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,670
years over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and I said as you</font>

459
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,260
know Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my work privacy by</font>

460
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,380
design i really emphasize that we have

461
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,480
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of this zero-sum and he got</font>

462
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,420
back to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right away I was just so</font>

463
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,980
pleased and said I totally agree let's

464
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,200
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to work together so that in</font>

465
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,840
our respective countries we can move

466
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,230
this we can get rid of this trade-off

467
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,399
fallacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I want to assure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

468
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I called it you</font>

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,550
scientists technologists I went around

<font color="#E5E5E5">the world talking almost exclusively to</font>

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,290
tech people security people because I

473
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,670
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure what I was saying you</font>

474
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,560
could actually do I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

476
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,820
write I want you to make it part of the

477
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,070
data architecture I want you to just

478
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,700
bake it into your programs can you do

479
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,740
that I had the best time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I spoke to</font>

480
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,830
thousands of tech people and ever

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,800
course we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're</font>

483
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:20,000

484
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,889
reaction you want but they said we can

485
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,990
only do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if when we're given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

486
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,730
instructions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write the code that's</font>

487
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">accompanied by what you're asking us to</font>

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we have to have the privacy</font>

489
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,360
instruction at the same time as we're

490
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,149
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the instruction on what it is you</font>

491
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,550
want us to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then he said they</font>

492
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,679
said that rarely happens what usually

493
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:42,860
happens is we write the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code we do the</font>

494
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,770
program we move it forward deliver it

495
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then when we give it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

496
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,480
say oh yeah can you bolt on some kind of

497
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,179
privacy solution just put add something

498
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,730
on Bobo privacy and they said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

499
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,190
we do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> best but obviously it's not</font>

500
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,700
going to be as effective as if we had

501
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,280
made it an integral part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

502
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,190
right from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning so as soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

503
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,080
heard that then the next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> I focused</font>

504
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,390
it I was going around talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs</font>

505
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,730
boards of directors senior executives

506
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,800
saying get rid of the silos you guys

507
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,320
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to each other and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

508
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the code that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes to</font>

509
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your security people and your code</font>

510
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:26,270
writers that privacy is an essential

511
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,100
component of that so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm a</font>

512
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,080
crusader trying to get this message

513
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">across and get rid of the silos and</font>

514
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,928
understand that we both have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

515
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and it was I remember Bruce</font>

00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,880
Schneier telling me look this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> false</font>

517
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,429
dichotomy to pit privacy versus security

518
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,040
get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that model that's what I'm</font>

519
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,200
hoping to do let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk you through</font>

520
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,510
briefly the seven foundational

521
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,250
principles of privacy by design there's

522
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,900
no magic to this they're called

523
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,320
foundational because it forms the base

524
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,270
of the program and it can be reflected

525
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,760
in a hundred different ways and has been

526
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,580
I've already talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a lot of these</font>

527
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,710
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll skip through some of it the</font>

528
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,330
proactive component of course we want

529
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to prevent the privacy harms from</font>

530
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,850
arising privacy is the default setting

531
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,640
is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important and</font>

532
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:20,029
perhaps the most challenging principle

533
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,859
for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow because what it says</font>

534
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:25,879
is it I want you to embed privacy

535
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,210
automatically in whatever you're

536
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:32,209
offering make it an essential component

537
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,879
make it a default setting such that a

538
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,200
user doesn't have to ask you for privacy

539
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:41,119
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to wade through the</font>

540
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,299
legalese and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

541

do that hands up last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you write a</font>

privacy policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice even I am NOT</font>

544
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:55,999
putting my hand out because people don't

545
00:24:51,619 --> 00:25:01,089
do it it's very unfortunate and it's

546
00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:05,149
generally speaking written to cover the

547
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:08,178
background of the people writing at the

550
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,839
assurance to your customers and you want

551
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,879
to say to them privacy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in it's</font>

552
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,539
a default you don't have to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

553
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:24,408
it comes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

554
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:27,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it builds such loyalty on the part</font>

555
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:29,179
of your customers it is amazing they

556
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:31,070
will love you they will reward you with

557
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:33,799
the repeat business and it will attract

doing the European Union has is in the

countries of the EU what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

567

is they're replacing all of those with

one is called the general data

law has the actual words privacy by

573
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:19,879
design and privacy as the default

574
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:22,820
actually in the statute this is a first

575
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:25,639
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is huge so this is elevating it</font>

576
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,389
raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar dramatically on privacy</font>

577
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:31,399
and if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged in a company or</font>

578
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,260
activities were you're already doing

579
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:34,659
this

580
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,540
you're way ahead of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> game and that's</font>

581
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I'm urging people to consider this</font>

582
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,680
embedded in design speaks for itself

583
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,140
bake it in make it an integral component

584
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,170
I've talked a lot about full

585
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,460
functionality for all the reasons that I

586
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,440
hope have convinced you to consider

587
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,180
offering multiple solutions at the same

588
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,910
time I know it's harder I think the

589
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,250
reason zero-sum has a bounded is because

590
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:03,400
it really it's easier to do one or the

591
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,200
other one interest versus another it's

592
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,080
harder you got to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more creative more</font>

593
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,630
innovative to do both but the return is

594
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,429
dramatically better and you know it

595
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,140
gives you a seat at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table when you</font>

596
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,870
consider positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum I'll give you an</font>

597
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,150
example years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I was asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font>

598
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,489
the board of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> European biometrics</font>

599
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,560
forum and it was I was honored but

600
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,870
really surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Europe they</font>

601
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,659
have hundreds of wonderful privacy

602
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,340
commissioners so I said yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

603
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,990
I'd be honored to do it but why are you

604
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,510
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me you've got these fabulous</font>

605
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,570
people here and they said it's simple

606
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:41,140
they said you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to biometrics</font>

607
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:43,179
you say yes to biometrics and here are

608
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,300
the privacy protective measures I insist

609
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you weave into your biometrics they said</font>

610
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,570
you know we may not like that but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

611
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,340
live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to accommodate</font>

612
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,679
it and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed something called</font>

613
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,080
biometric encryption which is all about

614
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,310
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the strength of the biometric to</font>

615
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,110
code some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> information a so I had a</font>

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,659
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with them we advanced</font>

617
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,419
biometric encryption it was this win-win

618
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:11,530
proposition of biometrics and privacy

619
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,190
yes you couldn't do both it opens up so

620
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:18,190
many doors when you do that in to end

621
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,750
security I started with a reference to

622
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,880
security at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said</font>

623
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,010
privacy subsumes a much broader set of

624
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,130
protections and security alone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

625
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,430
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have full lifecycle protection</font>

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end security from the time of</font>

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,840
to have any privacy especially in this

631
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:44,710
day and age<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is is the key it is</font>

632

absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical visibility and</font>

633
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,869
transparency

634
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,330
let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this for a moment</font>

635
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:51,519
i always tell companies and governments

636
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,600
it's not your data you're collecting

637
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:58,749
data personal information from your

638
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,369
customers you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the company</font>

639
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,799
collecting the data you may have custody

640
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:04,720
and control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over that data but you don't</font>

641
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">own the data it doesn't belong to you</font>

642
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,149
you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of the data and with</font>

643
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,488
that custody and control comes a very

644
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:16,928
strong duty of care<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data</font>

645
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:18,309
and at the very least bit be transparent

646
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,929
with your data subjects with your

647
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,749
customers tell them what you intend to

648
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,519
do with their data it's their data they

649
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:26,950
have a right to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to use it</font>

650
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,980
in this way here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's going if</font>

651
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,419
you intend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share it with third</font>

652
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,429
parties that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not aware of you've</font>

654
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:37,149
can't just do whatever you want with the

00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">data that's where the transparency comes</font>

656
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:43,090
in and user centricity is so important

657
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,139
if you can keep it focused on the user

658
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:49,809
all of this flows and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

659
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:52,600
respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the user they are so</font>

660
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:56,289
grateful I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't tell you the</font>

661
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,969
benefits that return to the company if

662
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,158
you have a trusted business relationship

663
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,799
with your customers customer gives you

664
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,409
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a primary purpose and</font>

665
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,940
you as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business later on think of</font>

666
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,789
another use for the data that you want

667
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put it to but you have to ask your</font>

668
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,950
customer for their consent customers are

669
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,619
much more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you consent for</font>

670
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">secondary uses if there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that trusted</font>

671
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:21,369
business relationship because they trust

672
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:23,019
you they know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it</font>

673
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:25,269
then the way you're describing that will

674
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:26,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">also be of benefit to them and they have</font>

675
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,269
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with it usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

problems relate to unauthorized third

parties accessing information but within

the relationship where there's trust

679

you're golden so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage</font>

680
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:42,820
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider all of this it seems</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot and on the other hand seems</font>

683
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,259
like not anything earth-shaking if you

684
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:54,039
do this I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll be raising</font>

685
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:57,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bar dramatically and just so you</font>

686
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:59,440
know this isn't a pie in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sky or some</font>

687
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:01,330
kind of theoretical construct

688
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,799
we worked with this is a paper we did a

689
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,870
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font>

690
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,450
consolidated all of these different

691
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:10,090
papers that we had done with the leaders

692
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:16,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the field these papers we partnered</font>

693
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:18,668
with Microsoft IBM Intel HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle with</font>

694
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:22,779
Oracle we did two papers on privacy and

695
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:26,230
security by design so this is eminently

696
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:28,240
doable and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason these major</font>

697
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,850
companies wanted to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to do</font>

698
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,730
this was precisely because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the</font>

699
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,750
return for both customers on themselves

700
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,580
in bringing this about and just in case

701
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah but it's going to cost</font>

702
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:47,559
too much let me assure you the cost is a

703
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:49,210
fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost otherwise</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to walk you through this</font>

this slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in san diego a number</font>

707
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,610
of years ago talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy a gas and</font>

708

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,049
meters and having a lot of resistance in

<font color="#E5E5E5">to wirelessly convey the activities</font>

713
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,320
relating to electricity usage in the

714
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,149
house and that didn't like it at all so

715
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sandhya Gas and Electric wanted to</font>

716
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:17,018
introduce some kind of privacy

717
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,860
protective measure and so I made my

718
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:24,490
pitch and I think it was successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,379
CEO stood up and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay i buy</font>

720
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,490
what you're saying it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

721
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:32,709
then he said now young lady I like they

722
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,389
called me young lady he said now young

723
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:38,230
lady tell me what's it going to cost me

724
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:40,360
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I said sir with great</font>

725
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,789
respect you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking the wrong question</font>

726
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,879
you should be asking what's it going to

727
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,370
save<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee if you don't</font>

728
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:50,408
do this proactively and yes of course

729
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,049
there's a small cost involved you'll

730
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:55,120
have a privacy breach data breach

731
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,929
infraction something will happen I have

732
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,830
no doubt of that and the cost of that

733
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:04,299
can be prohibitive because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

734
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,309
lawsuits that are emanating after such

735
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:08,139
breaches their class action lawsuits

736
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:10,480
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking multiple millions of</font>

737
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:12,260
dollars but far worse could be the

738
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,420
damage to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brand the</font>

739
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,760
image to your reputation that can ensue

740
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,270
from this you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to recover</font>

741
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,629
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> target I mean just gone</font>

742
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:27,139
and the loss of consumer confidence and

743
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:29,750
trust is what you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

744
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,850
restore so think<font color="#E5E5E5"> very carefully about</font>

745
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost that will be incurred</font>

746
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,830
when you have a privacy infraction

747
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,680
versus how you could avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by</font>

748
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:42,860
investing a small amount at the outset

749
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,020
it's it's not that big a<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal and we've</font>

750
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,879
had so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many companies and organizations</font>

751
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,680
around the world contacting us telling

752
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,260
us how successful they've been in

753
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,150
implementing here's one quote from a

754
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,950
letter I had from the Japanese

755
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,400
information processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> development</font>

756
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">center there are one of the very first</font>

757
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:03,410
organizations in Japan as a country to

758
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,770
embrace privacy by design and I love

759
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:09,050
this because they said that Japan's

760
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,449
private sector companies are insisting

761
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,490
on the principle of positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum so I</font>

762
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:17,449
thought if they can understand positives

763
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:19,939
home versus zero-sum then surely I can

764
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:21,678
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that language here and I actually I</font>

765
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,200
do apologize for<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that term</font>

766
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,679
positive sum but when I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> my graduate</font>

loved the area but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love positive thumb</font>

771
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,668
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought if you can have two</font>

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:46,219
interests escalating at the same time

big fan of data analytics I think the

output that's going to come from this in

780

terms of medical research all kinds of

781
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,090
things we can't even imagine it's going

<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful new discoveries and insights</font>

00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:25,750
it can also lead to expand<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

surveillance on a scale that is

787
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:31,160
unimaginable because of the breadth of

788
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,619
the data you're talking about the

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:42,740
making its really really important to

792
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:45,230
weave in privacy so that you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

793
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,479
would say you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

794
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:52,520
with big data you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have both think</font>

795
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,680
positive some not zero sum and last year

796
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,030
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things started grabbing my</font>

797

interest that we've got to be careful

798
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:03,800
with big data anyway this caught my eye

799
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:05,240
they said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite a lot of</font>

800
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,940
investment being made in Big Data

00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,970
technologies a lot of programs are

802
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:16,550
completely sputtering failing I thought

803
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:19,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was interesting and they said big</font>

804
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,980
data is much more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just input it's a</font>

805
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,690
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just plugging data into a</font>

806
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">program we really have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think this</font>

807
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:29,480
through in my day when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

808
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,160
University doing statistics you know we

would start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with a hypothesis and</font>

810
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,290
then we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a representative</font>

00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">sample and do statistical analyses and</font>

812
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:41,960
all these kind of things all that's out

813
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,880
the window it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what if you</font>

814
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,849
have the entire population<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you no</font>

815
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,550
longer have to do sampling what if but

816
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember that big data we're talking</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data analytics are</font>

correlations we're talking about

predictive correlations that are on a

820
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:02,480
huge scale and have enormous value but

821
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,359
correlations don't impute causality we

822
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,320
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very careful and this caught</font>

823
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,900
my eye in 2013 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> international</font>

worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy associated big</font>

there would you write a monthly blog and

keep us informed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> developments oh we</font>

started interacting it's just so

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,150
in terms of privacy is by embedding the

859
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,550
necessary protections into the data

860
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,650
analytics here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing I'll say</font>

861
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,600
I was talking earlier about correlations

862
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,490
and correlations can be extremely

863
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,210
valuable but they can also be at times

864
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:48,169
spurious if you can add context remember

865
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:50,360
earlier I said that context is key to

866
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,430
privacy if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find some way to</font>

867
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,790
weave in context as a feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

868
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:57,549
analytics then possibly we could impute

869
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:01,610
causality which would increase

870
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:05,690
dramatically the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the analytics</font>

871
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:09,410
taking place back to my central argument

872
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would drives me crazy is people</font>

873
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:14,870
say all God private privacy stifles

874
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,060
innovation the hell it does it does the

875
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,420
exact opposite privacy breathes

876
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:24,259
innovation and creativity cuz you got to

877
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:28,550
be really smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so free</font>

880
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,890
this is going to stifle you in some way

881
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:39,620
if you get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the zero-sum mindset</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can just have amazing amazing</font>

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,360
going to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few papers you can</font>

data utility and preserving privacy I

1002
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,650
think I only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to leave 10</font>

1003

<font color="#E5E5E5">through the remainder very quickly</font>

1005
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,420

1006
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,720
Internet of Things yet and we have to

1007
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,460
touch on the Internet of Things and this

1008
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,040
is but yet another paper so all of this

1009
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,570
is there for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at I</font>

1010
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,660

wirless and wireless and wearable

1014
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,009
devices you know the Fitbit and all of

1015
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:28,410
those all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is going to come</font>

1016
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">together in such a way that will</font>

1017
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:34,710
dramatically impact our lives because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1018
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:38,250
the data connectivity and what it can

1019
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:41,100
reveal down the road and actually not

1020
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,740
that farther<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road but first I</font>

1021
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,700
want to tell you about a very cool

1022
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,060
product which you may not be aware of

1023
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:50,790
this is a kanay a drama based company

1024
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canadian company called Nimmi and I'm on</font>

1025
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,140
the advisory board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me that's why I</font>

1026
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:57,660
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it they see</font>

1027
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,870
this band you wear it like a Fitbit but

1028
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,700
it's not a Fitbit and it measures your

1029
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,680
electrocardiogram your cardiac rhythm is

1030
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,299
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique biometric and most people</font>

1031
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">aren't aware of that like a fingerprint</font>

1032
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,970
or an iris scan it is a very reliable

1033
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,610
biometric and when you wear the Fitbit

1034
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:18,230
you sync it with your whatever computer

1035
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:21,090
you're using your laptop your cell phone

1036
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,760
whatever and it will replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need</font>

1037
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,950
for passwords or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier zit will</font>

1038
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,280
authenticate your identity and it is an

1039
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,750
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> product and it's based here</font>

1040
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,250
in Canada so I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want people to</font>

1041
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,190
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

1042
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:39,050
see it growing dramatically and let me

1043
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:43,800
point out that from day one the CEO of

1044
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:45,720
and founder of Nimmi Carl Martin he

1045
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,520
based it on the seven foundational

1046
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,899
principles of privacy by design he

1047
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,830
wanted to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy was</font>

1048
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:55,520
baked into every aspect of the Nimmi

1049
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:58,170
band and that you could have

1050
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,420
authentication and privacy interwoven

1051
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:04,050
together so it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

1052
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the privacy risks</font>

1053
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,960
generally speaking that have been

1054
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:10,319
identified with the Internet of Things

1055
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,480
or the fear of third-party monitoring

1056
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,910
unauthorized third parties having access

1057
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,450
to information emanating from these

1058
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:22,310
devices and then using that information

1059
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:24,810
in ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one has no control over in</font>

1060
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:28,020
Europe there's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the article</font>

1061
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:30,660
29 working party they focus on privacy &

1062
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,210
Technology related issues and they put

1063
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,740
out a paper short while ago and they

1064
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,900
said on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things you have</font>

1065
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,779
to make privacy the default setting you

1066
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to bake it in and they said follow</font>

1067
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,160
privacy by design because if we don't

1068
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,860
embed privacy into the design of these

1069
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,870
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose the</font>

1070
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,280
game from the beginning it is no way

1071
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:54,089
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it back</font>

1072
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,650
and once a year there's a privacy

1073
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,360
commissioner's conference I mentioned

1074
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,640
earlier last year it was in Mauritius

1075
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,920
and they also study the Internet of

1076
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,259
Things and they made a declaration and

1077
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,180
what I loved about this I love the

1078
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,010
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use they said privacy by</font>

1079
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,290
design should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key selling point</font>

1080
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,820
of innovative technologies I thought

1081
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really cool because it's a</font>

1082
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,960
positive feature that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

1083
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,150
tell companies I work with if you do

1084
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,220
privacy by design don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it to</font>

1085
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:22,140
yourself shout it from the rooftops

1086
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,379
because you will gain a competitive

1087
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:29,279
advantage by doing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will benefit</font>

1088
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,810
you enormously in the United States the

1089
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,720
Federal Trade Commission has also

1090
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:36,540
expressed enormous concern with mobile

1091
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,480
health apps and they did a study a short

1092
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,880
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they found that of 12</font>

1093
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,810
mobile health and fitness apps that they

1094
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,180
looked at

1095
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,930
and that the information is being shared

1096
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:51,600
with 76 different parties I mean it's

1097
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:54,180
like it's crazy it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and</font>

1098
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,160
there are no control so secondary use

1099
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,379
abounding unauthorized third parties

1100
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,200
having access to this and let me assure

1101
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,870
you people don't like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics</font>

1102
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,660
just did this study on wearable devices

1103
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:09,540
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a hundred percent were</font>

1104
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:13,160
trackable so everybody who's doing these

1105
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,560
devices at symantec looked at had access

1106
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:21,810
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> information was just floating</font>

1107
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:25,350
out into the ether you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

1108
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:29,250
way to do the opposite what this

you got a regulated medical device or

not it should incorporate as a default

1113
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,300
you're going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot default</font>

standards-based privacy and security

their product infrastructures you're

1117
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:49,410
going to see this again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this</font>

fans of privacy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> security by design</font>

00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,100
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they refer to privacy by</font>

design as a key pillar of their privacy

1133
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,650
work I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to go very quickly</font>

now let me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to the end and I</font>

1135

wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end by telling you but what's</font>

1136
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,100
the research out there what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1137
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:39,209
thinking Pew Research did this internet

1138
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">project but yeah I think I should date</font>

1139
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:43,890
this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was about six months</font>

1140
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and they found that ninety-one</font>

1141
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:49,799
percent of adults felt that they've lost

1142

control over their personal information

1143
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,290

on and he also found that ninety percent

of Canadians expressed concern about the

1174
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,260
low you start weaving in privacy by

1175
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,600
design into your offerings into your

1176
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:15,240
programs into your business practices

1177
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,839
you will get a direct pay off from the

1178
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,959
individuals involved in the area of IOT

1179
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:25,200
mobile devices do it now this is the

1180
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,360
time to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it while you still have a</font>

1181
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,810
handle on developing these products and

1182
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:33,330
services you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it before it just</font>

1184
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:38,580
back finally this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the message I hope</font>

1185
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,170
you'll take I think privacy is really

1186
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for business if you take these</font>

1187
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,750
measures I'm asking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it will</font>

1188
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,970
benefit you enormously even when I was a

1189
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,820
regulator a Privacy Commissioner I said

1190
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,700
tree privacy as a business issue not a

1191
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,690
matter of regulatory compliance

1192
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,450
obviously you have to comply with the

1193
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:59,580
law I'm not suggesting otherwise but if

1194
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:02,009
you treat it as a business issue you'll

1195
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,400
do more you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> l you'll raise the bar</font>

1196
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:07,290
and that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to do so I'm</font>

1197
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,520
going to end ladies and gentlemen by

1198
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,259
repeating<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I</font>

1199
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,910
been repeating throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> that privacy</font>

1200
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,850
is essential to innovation and

1201
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:18,240
creativity and you can have it all if

1202
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,880
you weave in privacy by design into your

1203
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,759
offerings you will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a win-win</font>

1204
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,910
proposition and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always my</font>

1205
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,160
interest I never want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to protect</font>

1206
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,109
privacy to the detriment of your

1207
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,990
business interests I want you to do both

1208
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:37,500
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposition I'm urging</font>

1209
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:39,720
you to do privacy and security not one

1210
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,180
versus the other I want you to deliver

1211
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">both and into all of the security</font>

1212
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,919
efforts that you engage in if there's

1213
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:49,379
personally identifiable information

1214
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,720
that's part of that package find ways to

1215
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,960
embed privacy so that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> minimize</font>

1216
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,980
the risk and reap the rewards thank you

1217
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,980
very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacing down</font>

1218
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,840
I think we have a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> left for</font>

1219
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,360
questions would that<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if there</font>

1220
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,880
are any questions there's a gentleman

1221
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,370
there yes sir hi sounds like your call

1222
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,470
action is fairly mackerel I'm sorry your

1223
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:21,589
call to action is fairly macro it's

1224
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,000
almost like a culture change and what I

1225
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,950
didn't see in the talk was anything

1226
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,330
economic related it seems like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1227
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the expenses you're trying to bring</font>

1228
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:31,190
forward would be need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be capitalized</font>

1229
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,650
and put into project plans in order for

1230
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:36,440
those of us to actually execute the work

1231
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:38,600
on it and and so when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1232
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,000
already put a monetary<font color="#CCCCCC"> value on it lays</font>

1233
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,380
five percent of the cost of a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1234
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,880
do it today the people talk is cheap

1235
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,250
right ninety percent of people don't

1236
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,230
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we all do it what's five</font>

1237
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,000
bucks a month for email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we give it</font>

1238
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">away to Google so we've already put a</font>

1239
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,420
price on that like carbon I don't know

1240
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:56,810
what how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve that macroeconomic</font>

1241
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee that's interesting so so build in</font>

1242
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:02,900
the economic aspect of it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is</font>

1243
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">a component of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offering right from</font>

1244
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,220
the outset thank you I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> you up on</font>

1245
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,960
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just explore that with</font>

1246
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,669
some of the business people I work with

1247
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,600
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a way to do that</font>

1248
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:17,860
when when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the senior</font>

1249
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:20,569
executives the CEOs about how do these

1250
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:22,550
how do these ideas germinate in terms of

1251
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,400
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop a program a plan</font>

1252
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:27,830
what do you do obviously a budget is set

1253
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,830
aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's an expectation of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1254
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:35,830
costs so you're saying factor this in at

1255
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,830
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time great idea thank you</font>

1256
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,980
yes sir

1257
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:52,110
the gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> was asking about the</font>

1258
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:54,990
trans-pacific partnership and whether

1259
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:57,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was good for privacy or not it's a</font>

1260
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,339
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1261
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:04,500
mark right now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been</font>

1262
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:10,260
exploring that since the TPP came out

1263
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:12,720
and there is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the potential for</font>

1264
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,810
for privacy intrusion there's no

1265
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,399
question but depending on how the

1266
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">information is exchanged in the</font>

1267
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,130
contractual relationships that are built

1268
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:26,330
and especially now with the rejection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1269
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:32,100
the safe harbor agreement by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the EU the</font>

1270
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:33,750
expectation is new I was going to say

1271
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,060
documents new agreements are just being

1272
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:39,500
formulated now to replace the safe

1273
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,690
harbor agreement and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

1274
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,480
embedded into the process I was reading

1275
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:47,670
this morning the u.s. is going to be

1276
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,220
introducing they say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

1277
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:52,260
the judicial redress act the doing it

1278
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,700
specifically in response to safe harbor

1279
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,750
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling is that the end the</font>

1280
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,359
privacy commissioners and that you are

1281
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:02,100
developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something as well the feeling</font>

1282
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,430
is that between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two intrumental</font>

1283
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,890
instruments it will not the TPP will not

1284
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:10,470
impact privacy adversely because of the

1285
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:16,140
strengthening of this other area so stay

1286
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:18,779
