00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,640
the whole fact that we have to do

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,099
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness training is the</font>

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,140
challenge we've designed systems that

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,540
are not safe they're secure when

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,280
operated properly and so unfortunately

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,439
in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have secure systems we have</font>

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a lot of training to have people</font>

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,340
operate them properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and know when</font>

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are going wrong I'd hope in the</font>

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,760
future we don't have to have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

12
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">today security awareness training is</font>

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,510
necessary we can take all the problems

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,309
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in the world of security and</font>

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,710
roughly half of them are technical

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:48,370
problems but the other half are people's

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,399
problems people<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing stupid stuff there</font>

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,538
is no patch for stupidity some people I

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at security awareness</font>

20
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:58,210
training is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create the human</font>

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,609
barrier between malicious things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,440
them infecting or our computer

23
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment the research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is showing that</font>

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,149
that's not terribly effective I do think

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,830
security awareness training is broken

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,630
and I don't think as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole I think</font>

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,550
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> great organizations that</font>

28
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,470
really offer some great training but i

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,179
think it's not focused in the right way

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,740
so what we've seen over and over again

31
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,450
with organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have like</font>

32
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,210
internal security program but they're

33
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">just they're boring and nobody wants to</font>

34
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,149
take them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to click through</font>

35
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,470
there they're overly complicated they

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,110
don't draw connections to real-world

37
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,940
activity and so the end user who you

38
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate and elevate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the level of</font>

39
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,500
side of security knowledge is clicking

40
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,670
through the vignettes as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

41
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,460
can just so they can get back to their

42
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,580
job security awareness training is good

43
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,080
as a concept and it can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,090
organizations an important part of

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,800
compliance efforts but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you approach</font>

46
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,720
it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a compliance thing I'm going</font>

48
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,410
thing from 90 minutes then you end up

49
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,810
with no success permit users get nothing

50
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,330
out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all they heard was a</font>

51
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,540
monologue for 90 minutes what we want to

52
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,420
do is create a culture change that takes

53
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,060
time and that takes buy-in but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

54
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,568
how to reach people to do sessions that

55
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,909
engage them empower them have them own

56
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,708
their stake in it and then watch it go

57
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,179
forward but we need to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

58
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,659
purely awareness a thing that is

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,790
pervasive<font color="#CCCCCC"> an organization by making</font>

61
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,200
security part of people's job instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

62
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">making it something special to have to</font>

pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to on top of a regular job</font>

64
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,230
find a way to engineer intern and on the

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">workflow so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that security happens by</font>

physios role in improving cyber security

72
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,930
training is making it entertaining right

73
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,430
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all read books and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all love</font>

74
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,159
watching movies because they tell

75
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,260
stories so we have to incorporate that

76
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,939
entertainment<font color="#E5E5E5"> factor any to the training</font>

77
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,858
so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can teach something that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">both technically accurate that's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to raise the level of awareness but it's</font>

also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to entertain your audience at</font>

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,328
the same time well I feel currently the

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,950
security awareness training is largely

83
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,900
focused on my computer based training in

84
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,730
which you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here's how you</font>

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,560
better security systems but it's dry and

86
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be boring so I think better</font>

ways is hands-on hands-on labs hands-on

88
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:14,578
ways which you show somebody here is

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually how your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information was stolen</font>

better secure our computer machine what

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,889
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an approach to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

96
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,929
awareness training that involves

97
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,269
connecting with users and explaining how

98
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,069
the security organization serves the

99
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,959
corporation as a whole and how the

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,369
security organization can serve

101
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,650
individual users in respond to

move away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the lecture format we</font>

requirement of a user is that they stay

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,060
barely sentient for maybe whole business

108
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,829
once we get to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in person</font>

109
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,259
you're more focused on the actual means

110
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,220
while still covering the bases to ensure

111

<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can meet our compliance</font>

obligations as an organization then we

get effective security awareness

114
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,069
training that makes a measurable

difference in the success of an
