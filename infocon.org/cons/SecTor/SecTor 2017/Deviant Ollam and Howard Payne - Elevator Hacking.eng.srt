1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,459
so yes elevator hacking welcome on the

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:13,149
last session<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the last day at sect or</font>

3
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:16,630
have you guys had a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so far</font>

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,740
that sounds overwhelmingly enthusiastic

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,330
that sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know we can</font>

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,680
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> be everyone's favorite talk at</font>

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,919
this point this is will wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> them all up</font>

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,198
fill up the meter that's so well right

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,080
yes you are here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see us</font>

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,239
talk about elevators so who are we well

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,670
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never met me before my name is</font>

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,650
deve I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical penetration firm</font>

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,330
I break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into places and write a report</font>

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,129
about how I broke into those places if

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,349
you're old enough to remember sneakers

16
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,900
that's kind of my job I like bourbon and

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,000
whiskey Howard my name is Howard Payne

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,839
no relation to pay an elevator which is

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,500
a long-defunct brand I am non-union I

20
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:56,600
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gamble and drink so yes between</font>

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,670
all those other side hobbies we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,619
with elevators we use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in our</font>

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,439
daily jobs both him<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> official</font>

24
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:04,849
capacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and me in a funny capacity that</font>

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,590
you'll start to see more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more of as</font>

26
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,039
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the pen testing section</font>

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,390
before we get into any of that is it

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,810
smart for people to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

29
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:17,180
if they don't know what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

30
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,220
so most elevator trips are completed

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,290
without incident in New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> City which</font>

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in which I'm from there are</font>

33
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:27,770
literally 24 sorry 30 million trips

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,990
every day and very rarely do injuries or

35
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,060
fatalities occur it can happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most</font>

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,490
of the fatalities that occur are people

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,320
like myself that are either working on

38
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,030
top of the car or in the pit or in the

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,699
motor room or<font color="#E5E5E5"> other mechanical and</font>

40
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,380
machine spaces yeah in general elevators

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,390
are very safe we know some people get

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,320
scared around you know tight spaces and

43
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,060
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for whatever</font>

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should not really be scared</font>

45
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,320
in an elevator if you want to see longer

46
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,360
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> techy versions of this part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,250
talk when we talked in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City we</font>

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,810
get all into the elevator safety systems

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,090
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about all the different</font>

50
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,770
mechanisms that exist it's a fascinating

51
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,360
world how its evolved over the years to

52
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">be one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safest places you could</font>

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,670
probably be in a building but that's not

54
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that incidents cannot occur and</font>

55
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,090
there are a variety of failure modes

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,209
that will result in grievous bodily harm

57
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,490
or death in this case there is a leg in

58
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one inch gap between the car sill</font>

59
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,670
and the

60
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,670
ending floor so actually though

61
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,589
miraculously this leg was saved yeah but

62
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,849
what applies to most people who start

63
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,409
screwing around with things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

64
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,879
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about a lot of</font>

65
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,798
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're smart enough to</font>

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,599
just be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well I'm not gonna die they</font>

67
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:36,049
forget that dying is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common</font>

68
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,179
thing that's bad right so it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,530
just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I know what I'm doing I</font>

70
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,340
know how to have fun with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this machine</font>

71
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this case this gentleman figured out</font>

72
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spin around on the</font>

73
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,090
escalator do we have volume back there

74
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,290
mr. sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> person this is if you're</font>

75
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,349
interested it's called the escalator

76
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,030
helicopter you can find on youtube but

77
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,970
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if we're gonna get our</font>

78
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:13,040
sound or not we'll see this gentleman

79
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:15,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">was not so successful now it still looks</font>

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,970
fairly innocuous but actually the amount

81
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of damage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was caused elevated this</font>

82
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,599
to a felony criminal mischief charge for

83
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman that was involved so in</font>

84
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the restitution he's now</font>

85
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,760
going to have that mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his life</font>

86
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,069
forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so dying is indeed not the</font>

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,769
only negative outcome of messing with

88
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,540
elevators don't try this yourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

89
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what you're doing that</font>

90
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,668
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> also apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me because he is a</font>

91
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,160
professional I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag along he's in</font>

92
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,870
training<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yes if you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevators really quickly</font>

94
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,379
understand a few key terms so that

95
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,480
you're aware of what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

96
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,798
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of this session there</font>

97
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,869
are two<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of elevators that most</font>

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,910
people have right primarily it breaks

99
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">down into cable driven elevators which</font>

100
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,879
are referred<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in the industry as</font>

101
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">traction elevators there can be a</font>

102
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">variety of those there's geared versions</font>

103
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,959
there's gearless versions but ultimately

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,790
all cable driven elevators are generally

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,650
referred<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as traction the other type</font>

106
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,048
is hydraulic and that's when there is a

107
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,180
piston a hydraulic piston below the car

108
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:14,180
that's actually providing upward thrust

109
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,799
from below<font color="#E5E5E5"> and normally unless you know</font>

110
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,418
how to recognize like the feel and the

111
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,620
sound of an elevator you're not going to

112
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,899
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference because you're</font>

113
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,180
only interaction with an elevator is in

114
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,650
the fixtures correct most people will

115
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,349
recognize these because they've written

116
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,789
an elevator there are buttons inside the

117
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,830
car there's buttons in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hallway</font>

118
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,620
you're indicating your demand

119
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,359
to the elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> what floor you going to</font>

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,920
what direction you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling in the</font>

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,210
elevator will respond to your demand and

122
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,980
pick you up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the</font>

123
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,930
direction you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wish to be and communicate</font>

124
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,110
where you are using position indicators

125
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hall lanterns traveling lanterns on the</font>

126
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,750
car that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these things are what</font>

127
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,490
you're seeing here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you</font>

128
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably used to seeing when you deal</font>

129
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,820
with elevators and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

130
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,040
you some more yeah now if you work with

131
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">your facilities team a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot or if you do</font>

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,310
some urban exploring you may have gotten

133
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">into what kind of a room this is called</font>

134
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,130
the motor room or the machine room

135
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,290
sometimes it's simply referred to as a

136
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,510
mechanical room in this case this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

137
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,420
nice large gearless Westinghouse

138
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,730
traction elevator these serve something

139
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,920
like 20 floors and they were quite quick

140
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,050
this is the overhead cable stuff this is

141
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,120
overhead driven contraction style sexy

142
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,910
motor room hydro systems not as cool

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,170
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite boring usually</font>

to be inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hydraulic motor room</font>

145
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,020
because all you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing is the control</font>

146
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,900
unit on the right side on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wall and</font>

147
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,310
then the pump unit in the center let's

148
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,620
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that controller though sure</font>

149
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,360
this is an older<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dover hydraulic</font>

150
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,740
controller and this is the same

151
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,510
controller with the cabinet<font color="#CCCCCC"> doors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

152
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can see there's really not too</font>

153
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,900
much going on here there's relays for

154
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,250
control logic there's relays for

155
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,450
providing power to the motor<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

156
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,820
contactors you're seeing on the bottom

157
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,440
left and there's wiring for the safety

158
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,300
circuits and all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling</font>

159
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,150
lanterns and fixtures like we were just

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,060
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but ultimately this box is</font>

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,739
providing all of the control to the

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,200
elevator system this is all your logic

doors this is what's driving at the

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,110
controller it's the brain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

168
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,580
elevator yeah it's all wired all back

169
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,260
down to this there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

170
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,659
circuitry or any kind of decision making

171
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,159
logic happening for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part in the</font>

172
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,710
independently right independent of the

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,080
controller and because of this there's

174
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,210
very little that normally could go wrong

175
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,130
in the cab if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a preview</font>

176
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,690
nurse eaters in an elevator riding<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

177
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,880
know the elevator operating it like in

178
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,710
automatic mode you can't do a lot of

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to screw the elevator up if</font>

180
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,159
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know well doing some</font>

181
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,140
things will show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> later but elevators</font>

182
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,030
on automatic mode do their job very well

183
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,349
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to your calls</font>

184
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,450
they're going to respond to your actions

185
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to even fix themselves if</font>

186
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,400
they miss level or if they get lost in

187
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,740
the hoistway there

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,870
robust machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to get hurt in</font>

189
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,210
elevators unless in elevators but

190
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,550
accessing mechanical spaces is supremely

191
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,130
dangerous this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actual documentary</font>

192
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,370
footage that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that shows the</font>

193
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:15,539
consequences of improper access of the

194
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:20,070
hoistway so these fine young gents have

195
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:22,190
accessed the car top<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a jolly old</font>

196
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,190
time

197
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,270
so you don't be that guy now it's easy

198
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,960
to laugh at that because it's obviously

199
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:46,180
you know drama right but that type of

200
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,349
failure mode has occurred and mechanics

201
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,580
and other people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working on</font>

202
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,290
elevators have been hit by

203
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,030
counterweights in the past fatally so

204
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,560
again just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done with</font>

205
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,479
disclaimers right now yeah after that

206
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,070
slide but that's that's the official

207
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,070
disclaimer right there you will dilute

208
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee but we said automatic mode is very</font>

209
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,190
safe in general and that's when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

210
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,590
riding an elevator every day you're on

211
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,210
automatic mode there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

212
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,400
special modes of operation that

213
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,510
elevators do have however would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

214
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,219
to learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them alright a</font>

215
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,740
number one the most useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I ever</font>

216
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,240
do as a pen tester when I'm working in

217
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,070
an elevator space and trying to use an

218
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,680
elevator to my advantage is find

219
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,170
independent service mode if I can find

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,990
the controls and activate independent

221
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,120
service I can pull that elevator out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

222
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,400
group operation it's at it will no

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,049
longer respond to other like let's say

224
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,549
the hall calls people who are pressing

225
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,640
the hall buttons it will no longer

226
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,589
service their calls it will no longer

227
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,900
drive anywhere just to park itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

228
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> full control of that elevator in</font>

229
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,449
the cab at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of extreme</font>

230
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,400
emergency situations like a fire the

231
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,640
elevator will do exactly what my bidding

232
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,900
is so if you have locked out floors if

233
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,390
you have spaces the elevators not

234
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,310
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel to usually I can get</font>

235
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,660
their own independent mode if I don't

236
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,640
even care about going somewhere in a

237
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,589
building but if I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide in a</font>

238
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,420
building I can put it on independent

239
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,040
mode I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sit in the elevator</font>

240
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,140
which will not go to anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

241
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
remember and i'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like lights and</font>

242
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,620
maybe some power if there's a little

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">outlet in the elevator I've sat in</font>

244
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,160
elevators with like an office chair that

245
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wheeled in for four hours in one</font>

246
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,640
building and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just plugged in my phone</font>

247
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,830
and like SAT there like you know playing

248
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,080
I think like smash hit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and</font>

249
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">just fine like waited till everyone to</font>

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,050
go home then I drove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the data</font>

251
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,140
center floor and stepped right out

252
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,969
because on independent service much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

253
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,040
the elevators logic of how its services

254
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,530
demand and how it does or doesn't allow

255
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,599
travel goes out the window independent

256
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,130
service mode far and<font color="#E5E5E5"> away if you have</font>

257
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
this in one of your elevators you should

258
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,520
be aware of what it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what it</font>

259
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
can allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> others to do and it can</font>

260
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,540
sometimes be configured so there might

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,069
be a way to disable independent from

262
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,020
overriding security and all kinds of

263
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,160
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately independent</font>

264
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,020
service kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of harkens back</font>

265
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,839
historically to another type of

266
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,670
operation which was attendant mode so in

267
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,040
this case there used to be elevator

268
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,719
attendants that would drive the cab for

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and service demand manually because</font>

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">elevator logic had not sufficiently</font>

271
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,140
developed to the point where the

272
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">elevator could service demand on its own</font>

273
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,750
historically you might see an elevator

274
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,760
operator use a crank like this in which

275
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,230
case they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can control when the elevators</font>

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,000
at full speed in either direction or

277
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,740
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold the crank kind of halfway</font>

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,910
out and go at<font color="#E5E5E5"> levelling speed so as</font>

279
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,710
they're approaching the floor they can

280
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,740
slow down and level in and make a nice

281
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,030
smooth stop for you the difference just

282
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,770
to keep in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> if your elevator has a</font>

283
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,600
tendon operation it might look like this

284
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,300
you might see an<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and down button and</font>

285
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,490
a bypass button or a non stop button

286
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,560
inside the cab the difference between

287
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">attendant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and independent because they</font>

288
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,119
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easily confused is that attendant</font>

289
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,560
will still service demand in the hallway

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,420
so if somebody's pushing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's</font>

291
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,459
pushing down in the hallway the elevator

292
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,370
will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and collect those calls</font>

293
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless the bypass button or the non stop</font>

294
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,240
button has been pressed or someone's

295
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,220
like a super<font color="#CCCCCC"> big shot right and they</font>

296
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,950
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> special priority mode exactly</font>

297
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,380
so a lot of the major manufacturers<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

298
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,880
added priority services so Otis in

299
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,100
particular has two types of priority

300
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,570
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones called express priority</font>

301
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,760
service the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called executive</font>

302
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,500
priority service in both<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases an</font>

303
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,420
authorized user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a special key</font>

304
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,400
they'll insert the key in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hallway</font>

305
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,890
and turn it that indicates to the

306
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">controller that somebody very important</font>

307
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,090
needs to be provided elevator service as

308
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,860
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible there are the</font>

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,480
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two modes in</font>

310
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,970
one it'll just simply pick the person up

311
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,550
and then continue on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its way the other</font>

312
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,990
will stop at that floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell everyone</font>

313
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,790
in the elevator over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice announce</font>

314
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,040
system to step out because it's needed

315
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,290
for another<font color="#CCCCCC"> person and then go non-stop</font>

316
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,969
wherever that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to go yeah</font>

317
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,280
it's pretty nice oh that nice having the

318
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,840
ultimate VIP service yeah so if you have

319
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,490
like a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority has anybody ever</font>

320
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,110
seen you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Express service like that</font>

321
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,550
or executive service have you ever seen

322
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like somebody bigger than you</font>

323
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,329

elevator a couple we got one hand we got

325
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,800
one hand there's there some people who

326
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,750
believe in you know a

327
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,729
super person calling the shots there's

328
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,760
something called sabbath mode if you've

329
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,230
ever heard of that yes I mean if we've

330
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,269
ever seen bill maher's film<font color="#CCCCCC"> religulous</font>

331
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,920
they talk about sabbath mode sabbath

332
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,779
mode just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's again it's a really</font>

333
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,610
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> style of programming in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

334
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,110
elevator it's too kind of it's like an

335
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like finding the loopholes</font>

336
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,290
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know the liturgy right the</font>

337
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,820
Old Testament does address elevator

338
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,969
usage apparently and this is the

339
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,500
solution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so if you're curious if</font>

340
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,050
you're not familiar with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

341
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,540
it's a special type of logic programming

342
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,579
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> created specifically to allow</font>

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,930
religious reasons they think they can't

345
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,829
press buttons or activate switches an

346
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,359
elevator operating in sabbath mode will

347
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,880
automatically without being asked take

348
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,000
its occupants to the very top floor of a

349
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,730
building usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and then it will</font>

350
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,370
proceed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to level and open the doors all</font>

351
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,500
the way down manually floor by floor by

352
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,140
floor allowing the occupants to step out

353
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,700
and never having actually interacted

354
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,100
with the switches or the buttons in any

355
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,600
fashion it's kind of you know it's like

356
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,950
hacking the you know it's like hacking

357
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">God right hey on super tall building</font>

358
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,950
sometimes Sabbath elevator will actually

359
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,660
skip stops so it'll stop maybe it only

360
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,029
the even floors or the odd floors just

361
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it can this can be a six or</font>

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,890
sufficiently tall but it's inch I just

364
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's neat because the elevator</font>

365

community made it up they created<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man right exactly it's</font>

367
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,770

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,329
not have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of a mode but</font>

370
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,089
you may understand and really wish that

371
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:35,099
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have seen load bypass mode why</font>

372
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,810
this is not enabled in more places as

373
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,670
beyond me and if you have a big building

374
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,079
maybe you want to consider talking to

375
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,969
your elevator text or if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

376
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,979
understand it hiring a better elevator

377
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,070
tech have you ever been in an elevator

378
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is clearly full and yet as let's</font>

379
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,339
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to get down to the</font>

380
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,079
lobby other people who have made<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hall</font>

381
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,820
calls it keeps stopping and trying to

382
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,380
collect those passengers and that you

383
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,329
just have to be that guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doors open</font>

384
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,100
you're like sorry it's full you go down

385
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:01,709
one floor and it stops again and you're

386
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,079
like sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's full the elevator knows</font>

387
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,579
how much weight is in it it can like it

388
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,930
should how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you ever been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

389
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,790
elevator that's overloaded and it got

390
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,300
angry and beeped at you the elevators

391
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,610
can't

392
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,410
they can be configured this way you can

393
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,720
have the logic in the controller say hey

394
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'm effing full I</font>

395
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,290
shouldn't slow down this process and

396
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,360
stop at every floor I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to</font>

397
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,060
the floor they can do load bypass

398
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,839
operation if it's turned on why it's not

399
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,189
is beyond me another type of really

400
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,470
useful thing again this is just

401
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,709
optimizing your facility if you have any

402
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,230
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your facility there's all</font>

403
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,699
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti nuisance modes that can be</font>

404
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,920
programmed in if your controller

405
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,899
supports it so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of someone just</font>

406
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,310
pressing all the buttons and like

407
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,600
hitting all the floors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and jacking it up</font>

408
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,949
it'll dump out those calls this is an

409
00:14:48,600 --> 00:15:01,079
elevator that has anti nuisance mode

410
00:14:49,950 --> 00:15:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we found in Hawaii I think so yeah</font>

411
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,519
there's all kind of optimizing you can

412
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,410
do maybe maybe you'll be in a building

413
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,209
that just has piqued service and it

414
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,069
tries to park the elevators and have

415
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,839
them wait either at the top or the

416
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,610
bottom at different times of day but you

417
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,589
can get way more into this you can do a

418
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:28,050
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optimizing yes question right</font>

419
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:29,430
here your question was if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> push a</font>

420
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about in the cab if</font>

421
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,930
you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one floor and it lights up</font>

422
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:38,430
another floor maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's in a Schindler</font>

423
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:40,170
cabin Oh probably broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I</font>

424
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,620
could be a wiring issue that does sound

425
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a wiring issue so there's a like I</font>

426
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,430
asked is how or when I first met him

427
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,529
what is his favorite special mode in an

428
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,599
elevator and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh yeah is a</font>

429
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:56,130
great one right riot mode perfect if

430
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,750
your building is subject to periods of

431
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,949
civil<font color="#E5E5E5"> unrest now obviously civil unrest</font>

432
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,690
is a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> common in the United</font>

433
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:04,109
States than in Canada but every once in

434
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:08,250
a while the Canucks will lose the cup so

435
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,260
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible the the way riot mode</font>

436
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,170
works is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the elevator will actually</font>

437
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,170
continue to serve intra building demand

438
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,029
so the ground floor will no longer be

439
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,560
serviced but all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> floors in the</font>

440
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,730
building will still be serviced the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

441
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that if somebody throws a brick</font>

442
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,760
through your window and

443
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,980
you know takes your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security guard</font>

444
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,390
captive that still it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not give them</font>

446
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,260
floor yeah if you have a real high

447
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,209
secure facility you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider finding</font>

448
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,819
out how this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be programmable for</font>

449
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:37,589
you you can consider locking down just

450
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,209
your lobby level or any ground access

451
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,589
level but keeping the rest of the

452
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:42,479
building humming letting people get

453
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:43,800
around and do their job while<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

454
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,630
policing up whatever problem is

455
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,859
happening down at the street and without

456
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,689
revealing specific buildings where I've

457
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,670
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's actually seems to be</font>

458
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,560
really common in museums like every

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Museum I've really ever been and has</font>

460
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,479
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to this so instead of</font>

461
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,790
civil unrest there's also there's also

462
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,070
seismic unrest so you can live in a

463
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,319
seismically stable region or you could

464
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,939
live in Southern California there are

465
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,069
essentially three different seismic

466
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,319
zones according to elevator code there

467
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,980
they range from most seismically stable

468
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,230
to Southern California there are usually

469
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,559
systems in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will detect if the</font>

470
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,780
building is vibrating but also the more

471
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,339
common method<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detecting that there is</font>

472
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,199
a major seismic event affecting the

473
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,540
elevator is what's called counterweight

474
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,000
displacement so you picture an elevator

475
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,960
that's on cables attached to the other

476
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,549
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cables will be a</font>

477
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,140
counterweight that should weigh about

478
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,090
one hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent of</font>

479
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,740
the weight of the cab plus its occupants

480
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,428
the problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> during an earthquake</font>

481
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive weight can actually detach</font>

482
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,750
from the guide rails that it's traveling

483
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,000
up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens you</font>

484
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,480
now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 4,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pound wrecking ball</font>

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,970
ball swinging around on a wire rope so

486
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,740
usually there's a ring on a string is

487
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,360
what they call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the string runs up and</font>

488
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,100
down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoist away and the ring is the</font>

489
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,600
contact so if the ring makes contact

490
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the string employment if</font>

491
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,899
something's moving around it sells the

492
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,699
elevator stopped as soon as possible

493
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,830
move in the opposite direction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

494
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,650
counterweight possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> even up in that</font>

495
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,240
case and let the<font color="#CCCCCC"> occupants out yeah so</font>

496
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,290
there's a lot of interesting modes light

497
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are automatically</font>

498
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,799
triggered now there are interesting

499
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,168
modes that can be manually triggered as

500
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,270
well medical facilities will have code

501
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,100
blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> service in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

502
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,870
of their elevators if you've ever seen

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">the little cold blue halo the little</font>

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,410
switch that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

506
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,090
code blue it's imagine the executive

507
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,440
service but even taken to a greater

508
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,580
extreme imagine an elevator that

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,009
was right at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lobby and kind of</font>

510
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,990
started to travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a doctor comes up</font>

511
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:43,059
with a patient BAM turns code blue on

512
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,620
the elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> will stop mid travel and</font>

513
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,480
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately platform back it will</font>

514
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the closest car immediately</font>

515
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,860
prioritize it and then give that doctor

516
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,629
complete and full control regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

517
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,250
what direction again yeah regardless a

00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,629
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them regardless a lot of time if</font>

519
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flip code blue in the hospital</font>

521
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,779
it I didn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passcode and it</font>

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,850
worked oh good yeah it was a job it was

523
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:08,440
a real job sure there's also code pink

524
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,730
not this code pink different one it's

525
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,610
also in hospitals you know what code

526
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,129
pink actually is code pink is baby theft

527
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,719
mode if the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby LoJack gets set</font>

528
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:18,219
off as you're leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

529
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,929

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,460
fascinating feel about baby theft

531
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:23,230
protection which by the way is very

532
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">uncommon I don't want to scare any</font>

fake fears baby theft is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncommon</font>

535
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,428
and almost all infants that are ever

536
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:32,350
taken are reunited with their families

ways including the elevators if it's

who doesn't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> there security recall</font>

551
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,419
can drive that elevator to a floor of

shut and the occupant can't do anything

557
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,840
at all it basically turns the elevator

into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a man trap so there's all kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

amazing security modes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

560
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:21,070
program depending on what you need in

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> facility just because by the way</font>

562
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,450
you happen to see a key switch that says

00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,649
key switches and they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

581
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,149
the same key so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got your</font>

00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,518
your inspections actually inspection

584
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,970
wouldn't be the same key that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

585
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,070
you th yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away the trade</font>

586
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,190
secrets now but this one this one on the

587
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,210
lower right here the security service I

588
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,369
looked at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like wow it looks</font>

589
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a very different key way and then I</font>

590
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:20,039
looked closer and i was like huh no it's

591
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:22,269
not different it's just beat to hell

592
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,649
what is going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i went to</font>

593
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the front desk because i was kind of</font>

594
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,379
talking with him every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time i left the</font>

595
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:28,330
building and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was like so i'm really</font>

596
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:29,980
curious man so your elevators are you

597
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,889
having like<font color="#E5E5E5"> security incidents every</font>

598
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,929
week should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i be staying at this hotel</font>

599
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,939
why is that key getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> used constantly</font>

600
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,409
and the guys like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no that's how the</font>

601
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,869
maids get down to the basement we just

602
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,399
needed to override blah so yeah just

603
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,720
because you see something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

604
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it means you don't</font>

605
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily know what it means in the</font>

606
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:48,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">elevator world and something a lot of</font>

607
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,369
people don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works that how</font>

608
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:52,869
it will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into is fire service because</font>

609
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:56,080
that's another big big security

610
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:58,840
implication so most people are aware

611
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,489
that elevators behave differently during

612
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,399
a fire than they do during automatic

613
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:04,659
operation most people have seen signs at

614
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,158
every elevator landing that say

615
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to the effect of don't use the</font>

616
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,249
elevator in the event of a fire you

617
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the lobby of</font>

618
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:11,859
most buildings there will be a key

619
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,809
switch like the one that's on the left

620
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,279
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows a firefighter who's entering</font>

621
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,590
the building to take control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

622
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,619
during a fire emergency the bottom line

623
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,999
is that if your building is on fire if

624
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,730
smoke or heat starts to appear around

625
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:27,549
the elevator landings where the elevator

626
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,139
opens up to any given floor the elevator

627
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:32,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">is tied into the fire alarm control</font>

628
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,330
panel and when an alarm condition occurs

629
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,149
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas around the elevator it will</font>

630
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,739
put it into what's called phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or</font>

631
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:40,689
recall it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the elevator out of</font>

632
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:42,549
automatic operation bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to a</font>

633
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:47,230
designated floor usually the lobby and

634
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:48,668
tell occupants to GTFO phase two is when

635
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">the firefighters finally get there if</font>

636
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:53,379
the building is sufficiently tall they

637
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,689
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk up 50 flights of</font>

stairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to a fire on floor number</font>

639
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,369
55 especially if the rest of the

640
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:02,200
building is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fire right now phase</font>

00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">two operation allows the firefighter</font>

642
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,120
to insert the key take control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

643
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,889
elevator and override the fact that it's

644
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,379
locked out of automatic operation they

645
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,970
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then operate it manually go to the</font>

646
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,100
floor of their choice operate the doors

647
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,350
manually and essentially do what they

648
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,600
need to do there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one key thing to take</font>

649
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,090
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this though the elevator code</font>

650
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,490
actually requires that firefighters

651
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:28,179
emergency operation overrides any ever

652
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,360
securities firefighters have access to

653
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,460
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> floor in your building by default</font>

654
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,229
by code which is your cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah your</font>

655
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,270
security guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say no there's no way</font>

656
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,620
they're getting up to 17 nobody could

657
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there without the badge and the</font>

658
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,899
biometric handprint and all that blah

659
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,389
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new and we have seen this in</font>

660
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,800
places where various vendors have

661
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,210
assured building owners that their

662
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,220
elevator was secured against such

663
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,770
operation we simply said well we have

664
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,520
the key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the firefighters have so</font>

665
00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes out the window yeah completely</font>

666
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,129
now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more there's one more thing yeah</font>

667
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,890
even firefighters do not have top-level

668
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,210
access to the elevators controls well

669
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:11,760
who could be more important in this

670
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:14,290
world than firefighters me yeah

671
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,870
inspection mode overrides fire service

672
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,340
even the idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fold the first is</font>

673
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,340
that if there is a guy working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

674
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">car top moving the car automatically</font>

675
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,540
bringing the car to a recall floor

676
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,580
automatically could put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in a</font>

677
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,409
potentially injurious situation because

678
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,550
that person is working the elevator

679
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,410
doesn't know what that person is doing

680
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,480
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car top so by moving it</font>

681
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,670
unexpectedly<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could cause issues the</font>

682
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,900
second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is if what if I'm</font>

683
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,730
working on the car top and the building

684
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,710
catches fire there's a little indicator

685
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,780
up there that says it should be on fire

686
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,130
recall but it's not moving I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

687
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,370
get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there as fast as possible</font>

688
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so yes being trained and avoiding</font>

689
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,550
injury that's that's that's the factor

690
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,040
there but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you getting into</font>

691
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:56,379
the hoistway nonin and a new there's a

692
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot you can do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hoistway and we're</font>

693
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">even going to show you some of it it is</font>

694
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,260
not a safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to be if you don't have</font>

695
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,820
the training there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of advanced</font>

696
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,100
controls in there that you can do a lot

697
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,110
of fun things with you won't know how

698
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,219
they work because legal has told us we

699
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,840
can't tell you however let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn about</font>

700
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">some other things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be</font>

701
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,149
able to see on a daily basis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

702
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,009
even implement if you want there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

703
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,439
of vendors that try to offer you means

704
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,629
to secure your elevators because again

705
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,820
if this is a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will take people</font>

706
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:27,168
anywhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your building roughly a lot</font>

707
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,309
of individuals to say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

708
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:30,440
people just to have control this

709
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,970
elevator I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restrict how they can</font>

710
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">use it let's look at some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

711
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,470
common ways that happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font>

712
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,139
taking away the buttons right the most

713
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,179
common method for securing elevators in

714
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,918
low security facilities is to include

715
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,840
what's called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutout that's what</font>

716
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,820
you're seeing on the left that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

717
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,619
key switch that tells the elevator

718
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,840
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> this button should or should not</font>

719
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:52,549
be registering calls when that key

720
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,889
switch is flipped it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either</font>

721
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,559
allow or disallow the use of these Hall

722
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,748
buttons there is an analogous version of

723
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,360
this in which there are no buttons in

724
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:04,549
which the key actually indicates what

725
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,110
direction you want to go the benefit of

726
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,759
the former being that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn</font>

727
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,860
it on and let people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do their business</font>

728
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,230
and then come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and lock it out</font>

729
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">when no one should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be there in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

730
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,619
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the key yeah some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

731
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">have seen systems where you need a Hulk</font>

732
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,529
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> keycard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually make the</font>

733
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,658
elevator go where you want to go that's

734
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,159
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> common situation so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

735
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,499
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a button it's just a</font>

736
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,450
lamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the light is on because I</font>

737
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:30,110
used my key card that elevator is going

738
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,019
to service my demand cutouts in the cab

739
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,189
are also very common right absolutely

740
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:36,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a fundamental difference though</font>

741
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,379
between a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall call cutout and a car</font>

742
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:40,940
call cutout<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall call cutouts don't</font>

743
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,709
actually affect firefighters operation

744
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,940
because firefighters have their own key

745
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,119
they can essentially register their

746
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,309
demand using that key cab call cutouts

747
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,840
cannot disable the button the reason

748
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,450
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the firefighter that's</font>

749
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,070
servicing you during a fire needs to get

750
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that floor they don't have time to</font>

751
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,639
ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what key they need to get to</font>

752
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,559
that floor yeah a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people think</font>

753
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:02,449
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a serial circuit and</font>

754
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,460
that key switch is breaking or enabling

755
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,499
that circuit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the case it is</font>

756
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,539
a whole separate relay going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

757
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,549
controller saying this condition is set

758
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:12,980
this condition is not set if you throw

759
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,360
it into special modes does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

760
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,070
what those key switches are doing those

761
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,658
buttons still absolutely work now it's

762
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,330
worth pointing out actually on that last

763
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,519
slide these key switches are like

764
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,649
factory default so whoever installed

765
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,539
this car station bought whatever key

766
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,668
switches their elevator vendor had sold

767
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:30,710
them and it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either doverton</font>

768
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,989
from looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide you</font>

769
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,940
notice somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through a lot more</font>

770
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:39,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">trouble can anyone identify that kind of</font>

771
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,929
lock it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see no not ugly that</font>

772
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:43,369
is a medico lock that is a higher grade

773
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:45,799
lock to the ones you've seen the other

774
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:48,289
key switches so far so you might wonder

775
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:51,070
you know wool what is on that floor I

776
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:54,710
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something little bit special</font>

777
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,879
so again there are alternatives that

778
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,019
even if you have a badge system you

779
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,449
might be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to integrate your badge</font>

780
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:01,549
system a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times it's done through</font>

781
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,830
dry contacts the badge system is binary

782
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,629
it works or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't your badge din or</font>

783
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,820
you're not there are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated</font>

784
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:10,369
versions and implementations of that but

785
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">most people just go for what's cheap and</font>

786
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:14,959
they go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dry contacts the badge</font>

787
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,389
reader is pretty dumb in that case now

788
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,859
the only tried and true real elevator

789
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,539
security that I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen was</font>

790
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:22,309
something he showed me and Howard you

791
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,809
know Howard show he's like hey this is a

792
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,820
way to do some physical security in an

793
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:26,989
elevator I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just fell in love with</font>

794
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,399
this instant<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like what is that</font>

795
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:29,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">some cuz he showed me this first I'm</font>

796
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">like is that some kind of weird you know</font>

797
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hall call cut out that's a big plate of</font>

798
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:37,999
metal that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one heck of a key switch</font>

799
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:39,619
right no they just put a prison door in

800
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:42,109
front of the elevator yeah physically

801
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:44,269
securing the elevator area is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

802
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">only absolute tried-and-true method of</font>

803
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:49,820
preventing people from using elevator<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

804
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:52,159
unauthorized way just to be clear this

805
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is not permissible by code this</font>

806
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,309
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a variance that was granted</font>

807
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,710
and I took this photo because it was

808
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,389
notable that they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get such</font>

809
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,440
a variance and it caused an incident

810
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:02,029
it's a little bit out of the scope of

811
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk ask later if you're interested</font>

812
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,929
what happen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but this was truly</font>

813
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,429
secure about controlling the elevator

814
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,499
yeah it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor</font>

815
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless you're barricading the elevator</font>

816
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,320
which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do in front of</font>

817
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,600
it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a vestibule around each</font>

818
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,100
landing unless you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that please</font>

819
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,769
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of your elevators like</font>

820
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,959
another set of stairs they are just like

821
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:22,789
an open stairway because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who know</font>

822
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,950
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing can get that elevator</font>

823
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:27,049
to go anywhere they want in the building

824
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,749
so we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security would</font>

825
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:33,470
you like to see us take a giant dump on

826
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:34,879
it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right remember there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hall</font>

827
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">call button kind of situation where</font>

828
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,699
you're not supposed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

829
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:40,749
register your demand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that car what</font>

830
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,749
happens in this video here

831
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,760
wait what well what let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that again</font>

832
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,710
so how did somebody just subvert that

833
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,668
with a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper well if you've</font>

834
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,440
done any other type of physical

835
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,240
penetration where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't rip a door</font>

836
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,610
sensor and make it unlock it's not that

837
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,740
different this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happened to</font>

838
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,299
be able because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car was at the floor</font>

839
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,250
where they were standing they tripped

840
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:13,080
the safety edge they tripped the safety

841
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,730
edge the IR beam break and they caused

842
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,289
the elevator doors to bounce right open

843
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it thought its doors we're</font>

844
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:19,620
hitting something potentially hitting

845
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,610
something now that's a really low tech

846
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,279
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing we just threw that in</font>

847
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,928
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funny but honestly flipping</font>

848
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,399
the elevator as we said earlier flipping

849
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,500
the elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> into other modes of</font>

850
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,000
operation by means of key switches some

851
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,130
of which are hidden some of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

852
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,320
behind locked panels you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get those</font>

853
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,029
keys as well some of which do things you

854
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,529
might not understand don't screw around

855
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:39,840
with that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font>

856
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:41,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but I love card reader</font>

857
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">on/off is literally like a function in</font>

858
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,179
this elevator like oh we have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

859
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a badge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get upstairs no you</font>

860
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:50,039
don't off independent service as you see

861
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,529
independent services there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

862
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,240
do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing for you this sometimes</font>

863

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always labeled with perfect</font>

864
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,090
halos sometimes they are sometimes

865
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,490
they're even labeled with what key you

866
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,840

867
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,220
this or innovation fixtures just too

868
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,590
hard to remember what key goes to which

869
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,630
lock yeah let's write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down exactly</font>

870
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ordered off ebay later because a lot of</font>

871
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,200
elevator folk don't really keep track it

872
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,880
they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> they show up to do the job and</font>

873
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this key or they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

874
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,769
the building owner where's the key for

875
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">this elevator sometimes if you're really</font>

876
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this though and this gentleman is</font>

877
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:22,889
and you spent your maybe most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

878
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,010
life working in the field and really

879
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,809
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you start documenting</font>

880
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,179
every key you find you start documenting

881
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,340
all the key switches you start maybe

882
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,049
compiling a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've been</font>

883
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,689
growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and growing your whole life and</font>

884
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:38,100
then you become the guy who has the

885
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,899
biggest collection of elevator keys

886
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,928
pretty much anyone in this universe has

887

888
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:48,620
fact these aren't even your keys right

00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:51,510
not anymore these are your keys now and

890
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,979
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keeps growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

891
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean he knows which everyone</font>

892
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,429
these does he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a job and</font>

893
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,530
just identify the fixtures and say oh

894
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:00,960
yeah that's clearly this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this key</font>

895
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,280
one second I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it on me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not</font>

896
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a lock and say</font>

897
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,750
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's this key sometimes that can</font>

898
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,299
happen but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the key</font>

899
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,370
switch and say well maybe this is Otis

900
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,799
well that narrows it down to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

901
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:21,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">Keys tops you have a question right</font>

902
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:22,889
there sir so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was so you can</font>

903
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">just buy the key to your elevator off</font>

904
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,309
eBay let us go a couple more slides get

905
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,720
into we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some we'll get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

906
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,250
that kind of works but maybe isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

907
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,020
best idea but what you want to

908
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,910
understand from this slide is that there

909
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,500
are brands of elevator and then there

910
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,780
are brands of fixture they are

911
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,280
aftermarket providers of products and

912
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own keys and key</font>

913
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,330
switches so even if you think you're

914
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,919
like oh I have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Otis Elevator you</font>

915
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,510
know you know job and it must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very</font>

916
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,220
secure because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Otis guy told me it</font>

917
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,410
was secure you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even have Otis</font>

918
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,580
fixtures in that cab correct you

919
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,580
probably will because Otis likes their

920
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,139
own stuff they do yeah but every you

921
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's all different brands you</font>

922
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">can identify them quickly and use the</font>

923
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,980
right key and boom you want to talk

924
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,679
through any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these at all sure again</font>

925
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,419
there are a lot of overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

926
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,770
different fixtures that elevator

927
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,360
manufacturers were installed that will

928
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,520

company innovation is really popular

931
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,160
when somebody modernizes an older

932
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,209

1014
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,820
elevator keys before from some suppliers

1015
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,810
I've never been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that guy to</font>

1018
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,950
this stuff and people will sometimes ask

1019
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,140
us they'll say well what about really

1020
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,848
futuristic systems I've seen buildings

1021
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,080
where you know you just tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1022
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:15,119
you want to go it's not like you're

1023
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,470
using buttons has anyone ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1024
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,780
it's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a destination dispatch</font>

1025
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,649
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the industry wants to</font>

1026
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,150
push people to them the public is

1027
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">distant because the public feels like</font>

1028
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,270
they're not in control of the cab but

1029
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">for efficiency and performance it's</font>

1030
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,020
great the problem is if you're a pen

1031
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,430
tester I mean what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

1032
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,319
with this thing if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to a</font>

1033
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,960
floor that's not lit up it's not telling

1034
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">me I can go there well what does every</font>

1035
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,700
elevator have to support in its mode of

1036
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,399
operation it has to support fire service

1037
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,250
how is a firefighter going to use their

1038
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,410
keys on a touchpad system they're not

1039
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,809
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use their fire key to</font>

1040
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,819
unlock the hidden locked panel which has

1041
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:54,099
manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> put and push buttons for all the</font>

1042
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,839
floors right there almost every

1043
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:58,569
destination dispatch system will have a

1044
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,160
simple access panel just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that which</font>

1045
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,599
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told right that even if it's</font>

1046
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> automatic mode you can just register</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hall calls or floor calls you can just</font>

1048
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,339
register floor calls from there there

1049
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,789
was one job<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had definitely seen that</font>

1050
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:11,558
myself yeah so there's all kind of again

1051
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:13,750
it's just keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind there's hidden</font>

1052
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:17,020
features of your elevators that you may

1053
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:19,539
not realize keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an</font>

1054
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry where you think the vendors in</font>

1055
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:23,289
the infosec world will spin a yarn that

1056
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,359
they were told by somebody and<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah</font>

1057
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:27,579
our stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> super secure the elevator</font>

1058
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,890
industry is way behind the times on

1059
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,420
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will assure you that</font>

1060
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,788
what you want they can do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1061
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,770
absolutely secure this was a casino

1062
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:37,150
right this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a casino the third</font>

1063
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,220
floor had some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-of-house</font>

1064
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,839
operations they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want people</font>

1065
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,459
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the third</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> floor this was</font>

1066
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a service elevator also so it's</font>

1067
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,730
worth pointing out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was not</font>

1068
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,930
intended for your regular guests but

1069
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,160
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't want every staff</font>

1070
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,169
member to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access that</font>

1071
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular area so they installed this</font>

1072
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,440
code violation aside the fact that a

1073
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,990
firefighter can't push that button

1074
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,390
without having the key it's also a

1075
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,038
tubular lock yeah and you at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1076
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,930
like hey man what's up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

1077
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,430
crazy lock in your elevator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

1078
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,618
the guy tell you he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1079
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,970
big deal I said well it's you know first

1080
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:09,220
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it's done wrong and second of all</font>

1081
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,230
if you're protecting your assets in that

1082
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,118
area you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> need something a</font>

1083
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">little better than that and the guy said</font>

1084
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,579
he says what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about it's</font>

1085
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:21,369
unpickable it's a tubular lock yeah the

1086
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:23,079
industry is reusing just keys and key

1087
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,260
switches that they have been given<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1088
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,819
some supply house over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over</font>

1089
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,380
Howard texted me a photo one day he's

1095
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,950
key I'm like I'm at subway yeah like

1096
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,050
these are just industry these are just

1097
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,089
industry supply channels someone will

1098
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,460
assure you that your key is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and</font>

1099
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,140
no one has it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know where these</font>

1100
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,880
key switches are coming from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1101
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,009
don't know how easy it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to identify</font>

1102
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,990
them and find the right key there's a

1103
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,210
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cross-pollination yeah you also</font>

1104
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,069
have stuff like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

1105
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,750
standard practice for one of the biggest

1106
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,490
names and controller configuration so

1107
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,480
they say oh we have remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> act we're</font>

1108
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,819
going to talk to you all about remote

1109
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,710
access in a bit you can remote in to our

1110
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">system so to set everything up correctly</font>

1111
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,650
we sent you this little linksys router

1112
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,150
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1113
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,890
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network just go ahead and</font>

1114
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,840
set the password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MCE</font>

1115
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,150
support while you're doing that set the

1116
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,980
admin password<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mcpc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support just set</font>

1117
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,750
it all to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one password so we can</font>

1118
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,310
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in and there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never be a</font>

1119
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,260
problem for you if you do that it's not

1120
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,990
like the PDF is published online right

1121
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,130
oh that's where we found it I don't know

1122
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,899
have you been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing the sound at all</font>

1123
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,280
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing clips out there yes or</font>

1124
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,750
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we've got some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1125
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,190
funny clips for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> too this one does</font>

1126
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,050
not have sound this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just showing you</font>

1127
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,490
by the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1128
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,280
the type of system that someone could

1129
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into if somehow they remote it in to</font>

1130
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,050
your network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wizz was installed</font>

1131
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:53,450
in 2014 keep in mind so if your IT

1132
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,190
people here my understanding is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

1133
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,109
XP is not really a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install</font>

1134
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,370
in 2014 no you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extended support</font>

1135
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">path that's right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's totally</font>

1136
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,750
great i'm sure they paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

1137
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what controllers are moving</font>

1138
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,390
towards the idea of an actual windows

1139
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,370
interface actual control software that

1140
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,049
allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact directly with</font>

1141
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,810
your elevator controller and do

1142
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,400
amazingly funky things this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

1143
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company themselves has said</font>

1144
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,330
well we can set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a remote connection</font>

1145
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,160
we can you know VNC into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font>

1146
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,810
and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1147
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,819
management all remotely if you have any

1148
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take care of you</font>

1149
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,500
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work just just fine the</font>

1150
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,270
next you know clip does have some sound

1151
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,440
which I hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hear because when</font>

1152
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,030
they're instructing people on how it

1153
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,970
works this is this is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> great stuff</font>

1154
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:43,119
here

1155
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:52,730
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to log on as manager n/a n/a</font>

1156
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:54,380
GE car and hit enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1157
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,310
I think we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick one of these</font>

1158
00:40:54,380 --> 00:41:02,260
keys here one enabled one okay here we

1159
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">go it's fine we'll go to</font>

1160
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,799
so he's setting certain floor lockouts

1161
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:16,089
through the software instead of doing it

1162
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,440
with key switch operation they're just

1163
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:20,200
setting it through the software package

1164
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,329
imagine how trivial it is just to get in

1165
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,879
and unset it what you're seeing there by

1166
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:26,710
the way that is a car panel in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1167
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,480
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can interact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

1168
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,240
elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if you were standing in the</font>

1169
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,670
car remotely through this windows box

1170
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,669
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea yes question</font>

1171
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,109
right the question was is that just a

1172
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,640
management interface or is that running

1173
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:44,319
on the controller no it's a management

1174
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,029
interface it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking to the</font>

1175
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,060
controller sometimes in cereal and

1176
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,109
sometimes direct over IP so I've got

1177
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,060
some friends doing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network</font>

1178
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:53,589
forensics on that I heard you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1179
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,599
sigh and relief and I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point</font>

1180
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:58,210
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can set things like the</font>

1181
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">brake tension so you know it's not that</font>

1182
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:02,020
reassuring that the control is you know

1183
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,760
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the elevator</font>

1184
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,349
controller it's just a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1185
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,240
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration it's not that</font>

1186
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">much of a difference practically yeah so</font>

1187
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,589
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff in this room</font>

1188
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're like oh my god but this is not</font>

1189
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,400
an industry that thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way this is</font>

1190
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:17,770
an industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is run by code and</font>

1191
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,290
default and standard policy this is an

1192
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:23,319
industry that said there's too many fire

1193
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,690
keys we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set one specific</font>

1194
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:27,460
fire key and it will be called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FE ok</font>

1195
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,500
one and it will be the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

1196
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,020
problems of too many keys and we will

1197
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,329
restrict it will say right in the code

1198
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,619
because that'll stop people that no one

1199
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:37,900
else should have this it should only be

1200
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,790
for authorized personnel so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

1201
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,920
sure that you knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly how this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fe</font>

1202
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok one works they publish the direct</font>

1203
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,880
bidding of the key in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code because</font>

1204
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:50,560
that makes all kind of sense but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1205
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,930
just how this industry is this is an

1206
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,500
industry that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have any thoughts</font>

1207
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,149
on security in any real sense and as

1208
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,730
Howard likes to say it's all naked on

1209
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the inside right right the fundamental</font>

1210
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is that if that car station is not</font>

1211
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,800
secured properly even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's T</font>

1212
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,599
switches even if there's a badge system

1213
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,609
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter because a lot of times</font>

1214
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,800
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dry contacts getting access to</font>

1215
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:15,390
the wiring is just the same as getting a

1216
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,460
copy of the

1217
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,308
in this case you're seeing the backside

1218
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,289
of a car<font color="#E5E5E5"> station in an elevator and all</font>

1219
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:23,819
the security stuff all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firefighters</font>

1220
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,609
operation everything with the key switch

1221
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:28,650
just as secured with contacts so a pair

1222
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:35,759
of alligator clips will be just as good

1223
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:39,000
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> any key absolutely look at this this</font>

1224
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:44,130
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> suite just opens up it's insane</font>

1225
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,190
there's not secured at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can you</font>

1226
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,869
guess what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of building we know</font>

1227
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,170
where does he always hang else casino

1228
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:53,880
that was a casino as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know yeah so the</font>

1229
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,039
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like just getting behind the</font>

1230
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,019
swing panel absolutely is something that

1231
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,089
can happen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that maybe</font>

1232
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:02,339
we've seen people do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would not</font>

1233
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:03,630
know we've seen the stories about it

1234
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,130
right it was a video of that guy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1235
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,130
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who it is so can't be called</font>

1236
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,900
to testify but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in cases where</font>

1237
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,359
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear as a job that's in scope and</font>

1238
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,279
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around a building</font>

1239
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,529
what do most pen testers do if they want

1240
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:19,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">to exploit this stuff they get the keys</font>

1241
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:21,690
they absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the keys as we said</font>

1242
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:24,240
there are nonsense key sets online if

1243
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,819
you know us personally you might be

1244
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the key sets that we have our</font>

1245
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:30,630
way better organized and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1246
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,980
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can check them out later if you</font>

1247
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,019
want to you know see exactly how

1248
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,640
properties are supposed to look they

1249
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:37,379
should have stamps from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manufacturer</font>

1250
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,328
saying what key they are they shouldn't

1251
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,130
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were run on a duplicator</font>

1252
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's wheel hadn't been refreshed in two</font>

1253
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,630
years and was run by a monkey on acid

1254
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,538
nice tight usable keys will get you

1255
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,220
through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things yes these are</font>

1256
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:52,049
mostly independent service keys because

1257
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,308
even my best<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends I will not give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1258
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:55,559
the fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys unless you've had a</font>

1259
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">training program if you have the fire</font>

1260
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,299
keys though you want to see a fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font>

1261
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,009
story all right we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some nodding this</font>

1262
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:03,839
is some good footage you're about to see

1263
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:05,549
just if this hasn't you know clicked in

1264
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,440
your mind exactly how directly and

1265
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,660
quickly this can work there was a

1266
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,130
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this building had a secured</font>

1267
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,529
lobby area they had a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a guard</font>

1268
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,210
in a check-in station but the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1269
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:17,880
the building did have elevator access

1270
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elevators were able to take</font>

1271
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,460
people down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their cars so the parking</font>

1272
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,779
deck was out back now normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said</font>

1273
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,490
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one could come into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1274
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:29,490
building and use those elevators because

1275
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,169
a the doors<font color="#E5E5E5"> locked out back and be the</font>

1276
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,910
elevator doesn't go anywhere without a

1277
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,920
badge you can't drive this elevator up

1278
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,839
so we said all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what if</font>

1279
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,610
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in that back door maybe</font>

1280
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,560
someone could find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to bypass the</font>

1281
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,840
lock if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take control of that</font>

1282
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,940
elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe put it in a fire service</font>

1283
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,190
or special mode and then do drive it up

1284
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,080
what happens well you could exit

1285
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,790
somewhere else in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building and then</font>

1286
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,220
because of the culture of security they

1287
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,259
had or culture of non security people

1288
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,910
presumed that anyone in the building

1289
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,290
must have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized they must have</font>

1290
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,640
come in through the front door they must

1291
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:02,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">have seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guard they must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1292
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:07,950
valid badge this is how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took us</font>

1293
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:14,640
to exploit this elevator so the back

1294
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:18,779
door<font color="#E5E5E5"> was locked not locked very well now</font>

1295
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,700
we both have elevator keys we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

1296
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:30,150
call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elevator but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's not</font>

1297
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:32,339
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go anywhere and then now that</font>

1298
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,040
registers an up call that elevator is

1299
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,960
operating outside of security spec and

1300
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,160
when we pulled the footage later then

1301
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
they said you know let's see what you

1302

1303
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,050
we must be on camera and they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1304
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,250
we would have noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing that and</font>

1305
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,630
we watch the footage as it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1306
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,859
look very<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspicious he's like well</font>

1307
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,540
other than you coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the way you</font>

1308

1309
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten seconds I don't think we would have</font>

1310
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,529
noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all and there you go now</font>

1311
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,180
I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there would be no more</font>

1312
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,660
disclaimers so this isn't a disclaimer

1313
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,129
so much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is as a cautionary tale</font>

1314
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,750
that simple act of throwing the key

1315
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,000
switches in the sequence that we did as

1316
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,100
quickly as we did and removing them as

1317
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,260
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we did confuse the elevator</font>

1318
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:12,330
controller yet get a very bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> way yeah</font>

1319
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,130
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend way longer than 10</font>

1320
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,080
seconds trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reset it so now</font>

1321
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,550
instead of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving the building we</font>

1322
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,130
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to go find the motor room</font>

figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the heck we did yeah and</font>

1324
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,330
and address it without causing any

1325
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,529
further delay pretty much yeah I mean it

1326
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,359
was out of service for several minutes

1327

taking the pins out very carefully once

1413
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,930
you disassemble it here's our pinning

direction measure the heights measure

1417
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:43,519
the position look it up an insta code

1418
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,710
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get the biddings pretty</font>

easily even<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high security locks if</font>

1420
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,509
you have access to the lock and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it apart you can completely get the</font>

biddings reassemble it put it back

1423
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:56,839
together and say oh ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bam Bam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bam it's</font>

1424
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,038
all reassembled it's fine we could even

1425
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:59,479
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if we were jerks we could just</font>

return one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these boxes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say no</font>

1427
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:03,769
that's all right it did not meet our

1428
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:05,440
consumer needs there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

cam it's a slightly more advanced one it

1434
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,190
is still completely possible to decode a

1435
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:21,019
little bit more advanced on the cuts we

1453

the problem is the lock we're not saying

<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to go get an</font>

1458
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,580
they so this is a really nice lockbox

1459
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,220
and we use these for our

1460
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,860
our system key control and key

1461
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,259
management is not ironclad there are

1462
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,910
people who can get these keys and if

1463
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,280
they get them they can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with them your security should</font>

1465
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,360
never begin and end with the idea that

1466
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,960
no one would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever have the key to this I</font>

1467
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:33,830
can install it and walk away one other

1468
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,300
word we said beyond fire service there's

1469
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,720
hoistway access there's inspection

1470
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:41,240
service this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stupid dangerous</font>

1471
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,240
if you don't know what you're doing but

1472
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to include it as an example to show you</font>

1473
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,319
that's why we've done it so you can see

1474
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:50,690
from the safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your chairs if</font>

1475
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,180
someone gets access to that hoistway

1476
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:55,070
it's game over for your security

1477
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,230
absolutely you're going to see on those

1478
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,270
two security cameras the top one is the

1479
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:01,760
floor we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom one</font>

1480
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:03,920
is the floor where we are the camera in

1481
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,010
the big screen is us carrying a camera

1482
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:11,090
doing something my mom was pissed to see

1483
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:14,840
me doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is us seizing control of a</font>

1484
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:16,070
car top if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this is a buddy of</font>

1485
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,630
mine from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevator industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so</font>

1486
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,600
so he knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's doing if you have</font>

1487
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:23,990
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that car top you can drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1488
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,750
car absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> unequivocally anywhere</font>

1489
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,580
you effing want in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that building and if</font>

1490
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to another floor and you're</font>

1491
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,270
inside the hoistway what kind of

1492
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:37,330
security do you think exists on those

1493
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:37,330
hoistway doors none nut

1494
00:53:45,960 --> 00:54:03,930
okay so i'm not going up to

1495
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:24,659
three now some jurisdictions will

1496
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:26,369
actually let you put you know varying

1497
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:28,739
types of locks on your hoist<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lloyd doors</font>

1498
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:30,899
but inevitably they always require you

1499
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:32,849
to provide it such<font color="#CCCCCC"> that firefighters</font>

1500
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:34,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have their own key are going to be</font>

1501
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,239
able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that key to open your</font>

1502
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:38,159
hoistway door lock completely defeating

1503
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,019
the purpose and many of these locks that

1504
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist ask us later how they're</font>

1505
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:43,738
constructed how they operate they will

1506
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:46,079
fail in hilarious<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may not</font>

1507
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,089
realize so yeah if someone gets into

1508
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,399
that hoistway it is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

1509
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:53,699
over also if someone gets into the motor

1510
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:56,368
room absolutely absolutely game over

1511
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:58,499
from a security perspective Howard has

1512
00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:00,089
this really great analogy that has to do

1513
00:54:58,499 --> 00:55:02,038
with different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of access and I</font>

1514
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:03,929
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense sure so</font>

1515
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,519
from the from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom up you give</font>

1516
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:07,199
your users keys that let them get to the

1517
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,939
floor they're supposed to you maybe give

1518
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,309
your custodial staff independent service

1519
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:13,828
keys you keep fire service keys in a key

1520
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,479
box for emergency personnel you probably

1521
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:17,789
keep an emergency hoistway door key

1522
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:19,529
somewhere in your building as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but</font>

1523
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the very top level there's that</font>

1524
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:24,179
machine room access which I've kind of

1525
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:26,699
liken to hypervisor access you've seen

1526
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:28,919
those controls are the idea being that a

1527
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:30,869
person in the motor room who has access

1528
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:33,209
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controller cabinet has access to</font>

1529
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:35,130
the hoistway wiring can do whatever they

1530
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:37,709
want they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could manipulate the universe</font>

1531
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoist the controller sees so as</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the brain of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the elevator you</font>

00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:45,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a phantom limit at this point</font>

00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you can do what's called jump ring</font>

1536
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:48,719
out all the safeties you can actually

1537
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:50,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the interlocks of how the</font>

1538
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,789
elevator will perform and not perform

1539
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,558
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like him do on tests</font>

1540
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:57,569
on actual tests like you're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1541
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,999
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accident</font>

1542
00:55:57,569 --> 00:56:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is not an accident this is all on</font>

1543
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:05,968
purpose so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a five year full load</font>

1544
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,859
test the elevator is<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaded to capacity</font>

1545
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:09,959
it's actually loaded over capacity and

1546
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:12,380
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be crashed into the bottom</font>

00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:12,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hoistway</font>

1548
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:21,900

1551
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,140
out the safeties and forcing it to go in

1552
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:29,069
a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not predicted so you</font>

1553
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,170
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed there's also a little</font>

piston in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the frame that's the buffer</font>

1555
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,280
it's meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that hit and yes</font>

1556
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:38,460
bring you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as reasonably of a safe</font>

00:56:44,310 --> 00:57:05,430
controller cabinet they are full load

1562
00:56:46,350 --> 00:57:07,020
full mains current yeah don't screw

1563
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,299
around if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

or<font color="#CCCCCC"> she is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing can do a hell of a lot</font>

1566
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,279
in your elevator environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1567
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,930
guy knew what he was doing that's

1568
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually another elevator personnel</font>

1569
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,990
we're right near the end we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost about</font>

1570
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">five minutes at the beginning but we're</font>

1571
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,049
gonna pick up the pace to get you

1572
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,759
through the end here really quickly we

1573
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,110
have a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> section we can talk to you</font>

1574
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,000
about about elevator phones we're not

1575
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:29,160
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into it just understand</font>

1576
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,770
that your emergency phone in an elevator

1577
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,299
has an actual phone line running all the

1578
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,460
way through down on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveler cable</font>

1579
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,560
it's a real proper phone line if you can

1580
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:39,240
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of that phone line I'm sure</font>

1581
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,650
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that some</font>

1582
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,910
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world in this community</font>

1583
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,940
could do to that phone line and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1584
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:47,370
some fun if however you actually learn

1585
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,660
the number of that phone line maybe it's

1586
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:51,420
printed right on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the door</font>

1587
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,220
for some damn reason you can call the

1588
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,830
emergency phone and it will normally

1589
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,750
pick up automatically silently after one

1590
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,580
ring now if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like an internet</font>

1591
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,560
troll you can call people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like I'm</font>

into an elevator and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

1594
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,300
they're nuts but there have been

1595
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">incidents where people have called the</font>

1596
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,400
elevator phone and not said anything and

1597
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">just listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's going on in</font>

1598
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,970
there people treat elevators as this

1599
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,129
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> private space where you can have</font>

1600
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:19,399
a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably should be</font>

00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,900
aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it may not be so private a</font>

00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,460
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things again if you're a lot</font>

1603
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,990
of a lot of big business folks a lot of

1604
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,640
commanding people in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

authority there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1606
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,549
some warnings about violations want to

1607
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,720
give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of guidance that</font>

1608
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,660
will help you stay out of legal hot

1609
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,450
water has anyone seen the PBS nova

1610
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,950
documentary that this slide is from the

1611
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,140
guy trapped in an elevator for like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40</font>

1612
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:42,689
some hours this gentleman was trapped in

1613
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:46,078
an elevator for approximately 48 hours

1614
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:48,000
right there was no one to come to help

1615
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,220
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the alarm wasn't heard and</font>

1616
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,420
the phone wasn't working coincidentally

1617
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,490
those are the two most common violations

1618
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,079
that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find alarm bell not</font>

1619
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,339
working phone not working now what's

1620
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,660
interesting about both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those is</font>

1621
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,920
that's something that you as a building

1622
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,440
owner can actually test on a periodic

1623
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,269
basis safely yeah so I would encourage

1624
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a building owner or if</font>

1625
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:05,819
you're a property manager or you're at

1626
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:08,399
all involved in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision making with</font>

1627
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:10,170
this to make sure that monthly tests are

1628
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,880
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> performed in this regard so if</font>

1629
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,710
somebody was to be entrapped that at

1630
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,089
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say we did everything we</font>

1631
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:17,460
possibly could to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

1632
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:19,529
safety systems worked yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1633
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,410
test your phone you know just press it

1634
00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:24,420
when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> picks up ask them where you</font>

1635
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:26,368
are right you say where am i right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1636
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,440
and they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to tell which</font>

1637
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:29,819
car you're in if the phone didn't

1638
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,259
automatically tell the perc because

1639
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:32,940
usually it's an automatic system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

1640
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:34,559
dial someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll say this is an</font>

1641
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,299
emergency call coming from elevator<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank</font>

1644
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:41,279
dial 911 so you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check that</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop the elevator and trap someone</font>

1660
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,240
reach the stop switch which was

1661
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:12,779
apparently thrown during the course of

1662
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,879
this yeah but in general you're building

1663
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:16,440
if you don't know how the hoist ways and

1664
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,359
other access spaces are secured and

1665
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,309
we've seen them secured really badly if

1666
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:23,130
people are getting around to these

1667
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,900
spaces either for nefarious purposes or

1668
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,730
just goofy purposes because they like to

1669
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,289
explore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how many urban</font>

1679
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,640
minimized if this yo-yo did this
