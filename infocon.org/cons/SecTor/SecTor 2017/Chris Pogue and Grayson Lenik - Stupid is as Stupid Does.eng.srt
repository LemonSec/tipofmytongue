hopefully this should be kind of fun

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,670
they called it the fundamentals track

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,140
for a reason so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully this will be</font>

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
how the cybercrime underground is

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,710
evolving so hopefully this should be

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,550
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit of fun this is me</font>

17
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:48,949
and investigations I have some technical

00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:48,949
certifications i'm a member of several

electronic crime task forces as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:03,059
a handful of the societies and

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,789
membership driven things for cyber crime

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,009
investigators<font color="#CCCCCC"> i speak regularly at a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of these conferences and i do some</font>

instructing as well for for law

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,829
enforcement so we're going to talk a

27
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,809
little bit about what electronic crime

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,449
is talk a little bit about law

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,950
enforcement and their role talk a little

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,140
bit about the criminal underground and

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,229
how the how criminals are getting caught

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,909
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the end results and some of</font>

33
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,590
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone away for this</font>

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,750
stuff in the last few years so just in

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,039
case anybody doesn't know what kind of

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,880
electronic crime is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really out there</font>

37
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,780
we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it pretty</font>

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,390
quickly here so I've broken it down into

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,530
four main categories that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see pretty</font>

40
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,469
frequently and there are others there

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,670
are other types of electronic crimes

42
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,548
like defacements and things like that

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">but this is the four big ones that I</font>

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,450
like to talk about so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one we</font>

45
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,280
have is is the theft of personally

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,869
identifiable information right and a lot

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times these go hand in hand with some</font>

48
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,310
of the other types but when your

49
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:04,979
personal information your social

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,929
security number and your driver's

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,280
license number<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

52
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:10,080
those kinds of things when those get

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,230
lost they turn into a couple of

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,730
different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> crimes most notably</font>

55
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,750
is identity theft where people will

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,820
actually assume your identity and open

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,270
bounce in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your name and go spend what</font>

58
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,370
should be your money not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be confused</font>

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,410
with credit card theft which we'll talk

60
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">about here in depth in a minute and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

61
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare fraud this is a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one in</font>

62
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the United States is sort of up and</font>

63
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,019
coming and I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys see</font>

64
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,380
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it here as well we've actually</font>

65
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,050
seen cases where personally identifiable

66
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,030
information has been stolen<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people</font>

67
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,220
will set up fake<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor's offices and</font>

68
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,370
start making<font color="#E5E5E5"> Medicare claims and</font>

69
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,560
Medicaid claims and by the time the

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,239
administration figures out that there's

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually fraud going on this fake</font>

72
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,489
doctor's office has long since closed

73
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,170
down and moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> away okay and they're</font>

74
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,310
perpetrating there's millions and

75
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,070
millions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions of dollars worth</font>

76
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,900
fake claims and stealing money that way

77
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,320
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another way that the PII is</font>

78
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,410
being used and then course the big one

79
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everybody's familiar with the news</font>

80
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:18,980
is full of his credit card theft right

81
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,320
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> two recent ones are Kmart okay</font>

82
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:27,290
and dairy queen which is a big fast food

83
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:30,019
chain in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States Dairy Queen</font>

84
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,959
was 395 stores over the summer this

85
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,820
breach went on for about six months my

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,459
dairy queen in tiny little Helena

87
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,200

88
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,880
card is probably actually lost during

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,548
this breach credit card theft is

90
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,470
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most prevalent electronic</font>

91
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:50,810
crime and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about why</font>

92
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,859
here over the next few minutes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

93
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:57,530
insanely prevalent the underground is so

94
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,299
well developed that it's kind of

95
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,820
surprising to a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll</font>

96
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,530
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that here in a minute and</font>

97
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,890
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course ecommerce breaches as</font>

98
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,840
long as well as the point of sale<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

99
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,940
people are still storing massive

100
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,070
databases full of personal information

101
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,799
and credit card data even<font color="#E5E5E5"> after all</font>

102
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,680
these years and all the breaches and all

103
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,630
of the time that's gone by and all the

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,550
security professionals appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage</font>

105
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,909
preaching at people about<font color="#CCCCCC"> not storing</font>

106
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,479
data that's worth something ecommerce is

107
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,610
still huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay banking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trojans an ACH</font>

108
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,969
fraud we started long long time

109
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Zeus bot and then moved on to</font>

110
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:39,889
some of the newer variants<font color="#CCCCCC"> like cried</font>

111
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,109
execrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> X some of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are are</font>

112
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,150
so good at infiltrating your machine

113
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,250
they steal your<font color="#E5E5E5"> keystrokes your</font>

114
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,198
certificates they can allow an attacker

115
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,479
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of proxy through your machine</font>

116
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,520
and transfer money around can I've seen

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,719
lots and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of businesses and several</font>

118
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,938
government entities that I've actually

119
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:57,319
worked cases where they've had a half

120
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,780
million dollars or a million and a half

121
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,680
dollars transferred over a weekend to

122
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,250
multiple different bank accounts

123
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,800
overseas because somebody literally

124
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,779
clicked on a pop-up box and got there

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,090
the accountants machine infected where

126
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,479
the ACH transfers come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

127
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,090
is bad news<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course ransomware</font>

128
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">right we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had BitLocker and</font>

129
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">cryptolocker right which Microsoft got a</font>

130
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,319
hold of the whole cryptolocker network

131
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,000
and managed to to give everybody free

132
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,819
keys to get their data back which is

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,930
good stuff not too long ago but I

134
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,639
thought we'd touch on that a little bit

135
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because ransomware is becoming more and</font>

136
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">more popular there's already a</font>

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,889
replacement out there for cryptolocker

138
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:40,219
that we're seeing and it's very very

139
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,569
effective people the best way to get

140
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">around this is to just go ahead and pay</font>

141
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,279
the ransom which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunate because</font>

142
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,770
you're in turn your funding them but

143
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,710
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is getting their data back</font>

144
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,240
unless you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> good backups so</font>

145
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,758
restore your backups keep good backups

146
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about law enforcement</font>

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,330
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Secret Service</font>

148
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,520
electronic crime task forces the task

149
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,430
forces are regional and generally tied

Carter's I was saying earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

323
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is an organized</font>

324
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,400
criminal enterprise and I'm when I say

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,490
it's an organized criminal enterprise

326
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,640
there are truly kingpins out there that

327
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,470
run the dump sites and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

328
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,540
actually doing any of the hacking but

329
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,670
they have hordes of people that are

330
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,089
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them cards that are being stolen</font>

331
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">from websites and merchants and</font>

332
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,430
everything else anywhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

333
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,680
would obtain credit card data whether

334
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,780
it's from breaking into cars or breaking

335
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,630
into websites these guys will buy those

336
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,610
dumps and turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and resell them so</font>

337
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,320
they build these websites you go out

338
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:08,330
there you can search so if you have

339
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,030
plastic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a TD Bank of Canada and you</font>

340
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,520
want to buy specifically card numbers

341
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,430
that up that belong to TD<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank you can</font>

342
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,640
do it on the carding forms<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they've</font>

343
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,979
enlisted out by bins and by locations

344
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,130
and by countries and by card type

345
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Platinum's black cards gold cards</font>

346
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,540
sapphires whatever you want they're all

347
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,850
available to you okay as far as the

348
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,530
infrastructure goes you start with the

349
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,140
malware authors and the dump site owners

350
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,500
which work together very very closely we

351
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,990
see very very large attacks being pulled

352
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">off by some of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that own the</font>

353
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,220
larger websites because they need

354
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,020
massive amounts of card data to keep

355
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,240
their sites running so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they work very</font>

356
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,449
closely with the malware authors we see

357
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,640
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of custom malware being used for</font>

358
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific breaches stuff that's been</font>

359
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,170
tailored to people like target and home

360
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:05,330
depot and dairy queen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kmart okay and</font>

361
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,469
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a josh is going to talk</font>

362
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,180
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff a little bit later</font>

363
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,580
today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evolution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of point-of-sale</font>

364
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,930
malware so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend you you go</font>

365
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,480
and catch his talk if you've got time

366
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> afternoon and then we stepped down</font>

367
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,350
into more of the middle men that are

368
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,030
part of the industry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middlemen are</font>

369
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:26,060
some of the hackers and and Carters that

370
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:29,689
are the feet on the ground right some of

371
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,280
these guys take leadership roles we see

372
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,510
some of the hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have teams of</font>

373
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,689
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> and four other hackers</font>

374
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,510
working for them and they start breaking

375
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,520
into machines large doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling off</font>

376
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,100
large-scale attacks going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after specific</font>

377
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">entities and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carters themselves</font>

378
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,670
which are creating duplicate accounts

379
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,829
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> below them they have an army of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are just money mules and</font>

382
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,140
they're they're handing them a fake ID

383
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,390
and they're handing them a stack of

384
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,939
cards and they're saying go buy

385
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,050
high-value goods<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-dollar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goods that</font>

386
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,350
we can turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on craigslist</font>

387
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,810
ebay whatever and turn them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into quick</font>

malware authors people that can organize

398
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,320
larger groups of hackers and cashiers

399
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,939
they work very closely with malware

400
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,240
authors and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a couple of</font>

examples here bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> B was probably the</font>

brings up the question of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

414
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,190
karting and financial attacks are

415
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,980
state-sponsored and I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate to</font>

416
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,600
bring mandiant and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt and all that</font>

417
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,839
stuff into this but they've done a

418
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,189
pretty good job of calling out what what

419
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,290
you would consider a state-sponsored

420
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,630
attack where we have governments and

421
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,610
militaries that are organized and

422
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,200
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after our secrets they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going after our communications they're</font>

424
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,090
going after SCADA and controls that's a

425
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,700
state-sponsored attack right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

426
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,860
state unit or a military unit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

specifically designed to pull off those

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks</font>

this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> state condoned so there</font>

432
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,590
aren't necessarily military units or

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
anything like that or commercial units

434
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,309
that are designed to go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

435
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,299
financial infrastructure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

436
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,059
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because there's so much</font>

437
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,700
money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made the attacks are</font>

438
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,720
certainly state condoned and that's why

439
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,980
you see all these forums in Russia and

440
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,950
places like that because there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

441
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,360
either no cyber crime laws or they're

442
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">not willing to enforce them against</font>

443
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,840
their own people that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

444
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,470
wait for these guys to leave the country

445
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,939
before any of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> get arrested or</font>

446
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,409
sometimes they're working from here or

447
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,600
from Canada are<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font>

448
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:32,000
so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's it's kind of scary</font>

449
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i don't think that there's a</font>

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,889
Putin at the top here as a mystery<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

451
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,720
but there could be and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that change</font>

452
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,949
happens I really think that they could

453
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably take down North America's</font>

454
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,409
financial industry in a matter of days

455
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,529
or weeks so it's kind of scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

456
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,389
about them switching tactics so I almost

457
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:53,149
don't want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> us pull the billions</font>

458
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:55,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of dollars out of this it's almost worth</font>

459
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,360
it to let them keep stealing money just

460
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,639
so that they don't destroy

461
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,379
infrastructure now something to think

462
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:05,269
about here's solez Neff Roman<font color="#E5E5E5"> Valera</font>

463
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:08,029
vich solez Nev he goes by track to

464
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,559

466
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,059
Russian parliament he was arrested

467
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:16,100

weeks ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Maldives and</font>

469
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,199
immediately the Russian press got ahold

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,360
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and said he was kidnapped and</font>

saying he was kidnapped<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the CIA</font>

473

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,919
own computer yeah it's kind of crazy I

529
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,630
mean you see some of these that are you

532
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,590
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it depends on how much actual</font>

533
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,500
loss they can tag on some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

534
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,668
and some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they know that they're</font>

535
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,010
I mean they're into this stuff

536
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,640
waist-deep but they can only get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on</font>

guys were the ones that were actually

548
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,480
deeply involved or heavily involved just

549
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,129
a two or three man ring where they're

local groups and local gangs that

553
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,240
organized hackers and cashiers and

554
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,670
they're frequently moderators on the

555
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,830
forums they will do a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,390
millions they're making hundreds of

559
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,399
thousands instead they employ teams that

560
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,870
will go out and hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> merchants and they</font>

561
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
keep the carding forms loaded up with

562
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,800
fresh dumps okay so they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> organize</font>

565
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,860

566
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,600
and sell the the card numbers to one of

567
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,179
the forums<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then turn around and buy</font>

568
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,060
other dumps back from the forums and

569
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do that just to kind of kind of</font>

570
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,919
cover up their tracks right you don't

Charles Tony Williamson otherwise known

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> guerilla black that's his rap name he</font>

603
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,080
also had the the nickname black dollar

604
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,450
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carting forms so he was an</font>

605
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,210
amateur rapper he had a fairly

606
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,179
successful kind of successful rap album

607
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,220
and then was actually kind of thrown<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

608
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:12,500
of the rap community it's kind of fun if

609
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,500
you want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up his story it's on</font>

610
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the b.e.t website they started</font>

611
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,510
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> him out as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know as a fake</font>

612
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,340
and he was stealing rhymes from other

613
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,960
rappers and so they kind of bounced him

614
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,590
out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hip-hop community so he</font>

615
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,530
turned to karting the one that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

616
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,490
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> on was actually purchasing 27,000</font>

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,930
they'll send them out to start cashing

648
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,540
out when they've broken into some kind

649
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:48,060
of a bank and they take control of some

650
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,649
of the the banking infrastructure and I

651
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,159
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally pulled off some of these</font>

ATM cash outs that inside of a span of

653
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,350
24 hours they'll hit every ATM in a

654
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,379
metropolitan area or they'll hit large

655
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,060
groups across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

656
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,670

Amsterdam and from the US and<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada in</font>

658

Japan they have these massive global

659
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,370
cash out operations where they will pull

660
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,770
millions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions in dollars of</font>

661

international currencies and all of the

662
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,610
teams get their cut and then they they

663
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,920
send some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money on to the boss</font>

664
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,250
who takes his cut on up the chain it's

665
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,910
like an episode of The Sopranos so um

666
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,650
but that's unusual it's rare to see that

667
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,520
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organization most of the time</font>

668
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:39,420
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are local and fairly sloppy a</font>

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,010
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times they're they're not as</font>

670
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,600

671
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,640
get caught there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of money in</font>

get pulled over right and have a bag

857
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,220
pointed at a jump server that was

858
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,430
located<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the united states</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

859
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,140
mistake number one mistake number two

860
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,850
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this guy was drunk half</font>

861
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,740
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was hacking because he was</font>

862
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,910
always forgetting stuff so he would

863
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,558
install a keylogger

864
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,990
and get it running and they need ftp

865
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,660
back out to one of his malware

866
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,910
repositories and pick up more stuff so

867
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,640
you'd key log himself and give me his

868
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,500
username his IP address and everything

869
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,750
else about where he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was hiding all his</font>

870
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,270
malware so we got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice samples off</font>

871
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,829
of those sites those were<font color="#CCCCCC"> good um that</font>

872
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see I've actually seen that happen</font>

873
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:53,000
more than once to three times so

874
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,828
obviously that information winds up in

875
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hands of law enforcement and then</font>

back on the streets probably within

998
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:18,900
another five or six years not too bad

999
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:22,080

1001
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,549
he'll can make it honestly I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1002
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,720
doubt<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll make it out of there alive</font>

1003
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,040
maybe they'll I don't know I don't know

1004
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,330
how things really go in Turkey but I

1005
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,700
understand it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a pleasant place to</font>

1006
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,160
go to prison but but he's going he's

1007
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,500
gone I'm guerilla black got nine years

1008
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,560
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his case actually just he was just</font>

1009
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,330
sentenced last October actually right

1010
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,509
after sector last year he was sentenced

1011
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:48,090
and he got nine years for<font color="#E5E5E5"> his role as as</font>

1012
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:51,990
a low-level kingpin in the Seattle area

1013
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:53,490
so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone shrewton the guy with 1.1</font>

1014
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:57,799
million cards that peed himself in

1015
00:41:53,490 --> 00:42:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Romania 12 years 12 years in the US and</font>

1016
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,450
sharable his junkie partner got seven

1017
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:07,680
years the reason he got half as much

1018
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:08,970
time is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he rolled he once he got</font>

1019
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,770
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rehab</font>

1020
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,959
he gave them everything all his

1021
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,180
passwords all his encryption keys and

1022
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,410
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I understand they actually</font>

1023
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:22,710
used his IDs to lure shrewton into

1024
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,990
traveling so that stuff happens that's

1025
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:28,590
that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff works okay but</font>

1026
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:30,899
some final thoughts here um electronic

1027
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">crimes not really yet considered</font>

1028
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,400
state-sponsored but it's almost

1029
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,839
definitely state can don't so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1030
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,330
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be very very careful and</font>

1031
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,560
watch where this goes very carefully

1032
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,690
because if it does become

1033
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,859
state-sponsored we're going to go from

1034
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,560
oh look at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money they're</font>

1035
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,848
stealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too oh crap we have no</font>

1036
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,109
financial infrastructure they're going

1037
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,820
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut it down as a</font>

1038
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:53,730
precursor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other kind of attack</font>

1039
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,530
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's very dangerous and it's</font>

1040
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,090
funny to watch what's what you know what

1041
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,700
criminals do and how they get caught in

1042
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,560
some of the dumb things but we need to

1043
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,660
be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful and very vigilant</font>

1044
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,040
about this because if they decide to

1045
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,810
change tactics it's going to get very

1046
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,720
very ugly for all of us okay if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1047
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:15,750
system administrator or an infosec

1048
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,419
person protect what you have and more

1049
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,720
importantly prepare yourself and your

00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and your teams for quick response Ryan</font>

1051
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,209
yesterday put it very very eloquently

1052
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,460
and said that the the perimeter security

1053
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,410
is is it's kind of a thing of the past

1054
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,450
it's it's a it's a it's a dying art

1055
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,970
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to breach your perimeter</font>

1056
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,770
what are you going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do once</font>

1057
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,560
they do breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> your parameter is</font>

1058
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,230
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important so train like</font>

1059
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,810
you fight fight like you train if you're

1060
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,390
not having real world goal-based

1061
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:50,670
penetration tests instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of saying okay</font>

1062
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:55,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want you to attack my two servers</font>

somebody come in and attack you like a

real attacker would is a penetration

1067
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,650
test and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more importantly than that</font>

1068
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,450
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> is can you identify when they do</font>

1069
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,210
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell when somebody breaches your</font>

1070
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,529
perimeter do you know what it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1071
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:16,080
that's what i mean by train like you

1072
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,490
fight and fight like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you train and don't</font>

1073
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,310
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage law enforcement if you</font>

away unless everybody starts reporting

1082
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:38,989
and when you've got good<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to report</font>

1083
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,529
really really good things happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:45,440
and chin up right this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

1088
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:55,368
people steadily get better and<font color="#CCCCCC"> better so</font>

1089
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:57,259
we can win the fight you just have to

1090
00:44:55,369 --> 00:45:03,019
keep changing tactics the same way that

1091
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:05,900
they do ok any questions anybody else

1092
