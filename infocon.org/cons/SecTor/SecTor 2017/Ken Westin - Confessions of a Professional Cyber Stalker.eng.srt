1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,690
hi there my name is Ken Weston I going

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:13,600
to be talking today about cyber stalking

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,930
I actually was able to do this legally

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,369
so if you came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stock your ex-girlfriend things like</font>

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,530
that this probably isn't the best talk

7
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:25,509
for you so currently my name is Ken

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:28,270
Weston<font color="#CCCCCC"> I founded a company called</font>

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,570
gadgettrak a while back was a start-up

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,820
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of through some</font>

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,460
research that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was interested in that I</font>

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of stumbled into this industry and</font>

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,489
I'll kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have that</font>

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,760
evolved and how it ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up creating</font>

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,199
multiple products and how they then also

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,629
started working with law enforcement to

17
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:49,089
uncover a wide range of different crimes

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,718
we would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stone devices would</font>

19
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:54,760
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of function basically as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan</font>

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,440
into some of these criminal networks so

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,260
we'd be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify a lot of</font>

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,818
fencing operations we would find drugs

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,428
we would find all sorts of other crimes

24
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:05,950
that were committed even helped recover

25
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,450
a stolen vehicle at one point and I'll

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,650
kind of talk through some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually walk you through some actual</font>

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,840
cases as well so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed theft</font>

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,970
recovery tools for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of devices i</font>

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,280
started with USB moved into laptop

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,170
mobile and through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found that</font>

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also ways of harvesting</font>

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,970
information through social media by

34
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,529
extracting exif data from images for

35
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,660
example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to walk through</font>

36
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and show you some</font>

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,619
of those tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked very closely</font>

38
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,869
with law enforcement on a number of

39
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,370
investigations it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind of</font>

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,920
the highlight of the of the gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

41
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,690
actually whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer that</font>

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a laptop stolen i would work on that</font>

43
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,860
case and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked directly with law</font>

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,660
enforcement and through that I was

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,120
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn a lot about you</font>

46
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,140
know how law enforcement functions what

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,790
they're able to do in some of the

48
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,100
challenges with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovering a</font>

49
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">stolen device sometimes people have</font>

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,130
their phone or laptop stolen they

51
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,310
contact law enforcement it doesn't seem

52
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,630
like you're doing anything and it's it's

53
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,790
kind of difficult for them to do when

54
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,158
they have thousands of devices but I

55
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,319
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of sort of social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering</font>

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,519
the police into<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention to some</font>

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,369
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cases and I'll walk through that</font>

58
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:15,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so I put a lot of bad people in</font>

59
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,069
jail probably roughly several several

60
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,810
dozen a lot of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

61
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,298
you think you'd only get one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person we</font>

62
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,519
would end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> resting six to seven people</font>

63
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:26,920
in each case and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these guys</font>

64
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,329
were pretty bad dudes a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

65
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,059
records already<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had warrants out</font>

66
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:33,519
for their arrest so police<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to work</font>

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,180
with me whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a recovery they</font>

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,859
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to pay attention</font>

69
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,319
because they knew they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

70
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:40,150
some other bad guys I'm currently a

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,280
senior security analyst a tripwire so

72
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,819
I'm actually now working on you know

73
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding different types of criminals and</font>

74
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,439
helping enterprises secure their

75
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:54,250
infrastructure I have a real passion for

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:56,168
for enabling security I love just

77
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,310
working with customers as well i'm

78
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,319
attending identifying patterns

79
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,199
especially when it comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks and</font>

80
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you can actually correlate</font>

81
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,180
intelligence within an environment to

82
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:09,280
tell protected so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to</font>

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,769
call my wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shame these are some</font>

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">photos of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual cases so you'll see</font>

85
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,750
that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the faces are blurred out</font>

86
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,219
that is to protect the guilty those are

87
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,010
photos that were actually captured by

88
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,810
stolen laptops the software would

89
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,189
actually gather location from Wi-Fi

90
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,560
networks it would then use the web

91
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:29,439
camera that's built into the devices to

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,060
capture a photo at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it was I was</font>

93
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,470
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first people actually to tie</font>

94
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,299
those two together to actually integrate

95
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,840
both the web camera as well as getting a

96
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:41,500
location from Wi-Fi networks so that's

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,129
the that's it for this life so and as

98
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,810
you can imagine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not everyone</font>

99
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,340
was a fan of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff I'm doing</font>

100
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,650
a lot of this because they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

101
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,090
understand the intentions when you're

102
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,909
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this type of technology you</font>

103
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,590
know privacy is a big concern and that's

104
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,409
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bake into</font>

105
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,879
the products was gathered just enough

106
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,129
information for theft recovery purposes

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,840
but not enough that it would become a

108
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,310
liability for me to secure if someone

109
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,019
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack into our servers for</font>

110
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,810
example would they be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to access</font>

111
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's web camera things like that</font>

112
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,129
we also moved into actually backing up

113
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,919
contact data in photos<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was very</font>

114
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,560
very paranoid about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,029
it's not a matter of if but when so if

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone did compromise a server for</font>

117
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,570
example I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to compromise</font>

118
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,710
the data so we actually built in

119
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,630
mechanisms in there where you can

120
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a privacy key that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

121
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,750
enter on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

122
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,640
encrypt the information before

123
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,430
even hits the cloud so the nice thing

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,140
there is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do get hacked or if law</font>

125
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,320
enforcement actually requested photos

126
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,210
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer we could then sure here</font>

127
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go mr. police officer here's a big</font>

128
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,270
encrypted blob you're going to have to

129
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,340
go to the customer to get the privacy

130
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,080
key because it's encrypted so there was

131
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,190
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that I was just</font>

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">very paranoid dealing with the</font>

133
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology to to ensure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font>

134
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">did protect people's privacy so how this</font>

135
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,630
got started was I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

136
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,490
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> his security company at that point</font>

137
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,230
most of my security was mostly focused

138
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,840
on web server so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically a</font>

139
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,630
system administrator so I managed you

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,369
know linux servers but we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

141
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,680
product that was focused on end point so

142
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,610
if someone plugged in a flash drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
would actually block them from

144
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,780
installing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trojan or stealing data off</font>

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network so i became very very</font>

146
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,070
interested in these sort of USB based

147
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,049
Trojans because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a lazy</font>

148
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,580
hacker and it's like it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

149
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,530
easier if you're actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

150
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,060
infiltrate an organization and steal or

151
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,940
compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network from the inside</font>

152
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,160
we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to even with industrial</font>

153
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,480
control systems like Stuxnet and things

154
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,640
like that where that was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,250
point of attack was actually from a

156
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,500
flash drive so I built a website called

157
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,940
a USB hacks com and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually started</font>

158
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,860
putting some of these exploit tools out

159
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,500
there that I was finding I'm also helped

160
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,730
build some of them and as you can

161
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,630
imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time</font>

162
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got contacted by the FBI what the hell</font>

163
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing but the idea there was you</font>

164
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,620
know I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

165
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,330
more about raising<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness is not</font>

166
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,770
providing these tools for criminals and

167
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,450
actually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put these tools up but</font>

168
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">also helped antivirus vendors get</font>

169
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,800
signatures for them as well and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

170
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,409
talked about tools and techniques and so

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I actually developed a pretty</font>

172
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,480
pretty big community from this but then

173
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,310
just because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest I</font>

174
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,220
had from both sides of law enforcement I

175
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,170
did decide to shut it down at one point

176
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,880
but I was working on my master's degree

177
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,890
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take this technology</font>

179
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,360
and actually do some good with it you

180
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,640
know what if I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of take</font>

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,410
this Trojan virus and we turned it into

182
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,520
a happy virus thanks Bob so you know the

183
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that if</font>

184
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,250
a USB flash<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive is stolen and connect</font>

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,599
to a computer you're able to hijack that

186
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,919
and send information out and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

187
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email that I actually</font>

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,508
got sent so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually fairly simple</font>

189
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,758
it grabs my<font color="#CCCCCC"> P address it also grabs</font>

190
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,050
internal network address but more

191
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,430
importantly it gets the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

192
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,400
and the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use of this logged</font>

193
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,780
in this simple right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,429
have to gather any more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information than</font>

195
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,469
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to open up a back</font>

196
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,940
door into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system this is enough</font>

197
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,919
information for law enforcement to

198
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,259
follow up on that case work with the

199
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">carrier's to identify the subscriber if</font>

200
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,880
they need to and what's interesting is

201
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,258
that you know when I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and I</font>

202
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,229
launched it I ought just offered it for

203
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:30,610
free I put it out there the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

204
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:32,380
nope mr. Lew Marie the the website ended

205
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,110
up getting docked at death we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had about</font>

206
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">20,000 people register the server</font>

207
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,180
crashed horribly I was not prepared for

208
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we got that ramped up and then I</font>

209
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,169
actually offered a pro version what's

210
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,490
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is that I found a lot</font>

211
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,590
of other devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would work</font>

212
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with basically it was a crowdsource</font>

213
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,469
testing so it worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with not just flash</font>

214
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,780
drives but also external hard drives it

215
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,940
work with digital cameras I was even

216
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,099
approached by a company that makes very

217
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,139
high in thermal imaging cameras and I

218
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,669
work with them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually develop a</font>

219
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,979
customized agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they found it</font>

220
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,340
at work with those devices as well and

221
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,990
even the the first iPods as well it was

222
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,750
working with so that was really

223
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code is it's fairly</font>

224
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,409
simple I've actually put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on a</font>

225
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:21,460
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> here if you want to download</font>

226
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,990
that and play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly</font>

227
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,370
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that you review the code</font>

228
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,469
and look at the server that is talking

229
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to I've said this before but people are</font>

230
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,130
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code and I'm getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pings</font>

231
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,529
on one of my servers and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

232
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,779
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system so just be</font>

233
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,240
very cautious when you're utilizing the

234
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,279
code and a lot of this just took

235
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,320
advantage basically of vulnerabilities

236
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,070
within windows XP with the autorun

237
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,589
capability and even in Windows 2000

238
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,940
there was some similar functionality so

239
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,520
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a particularly you know</font>

240
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,610
complex or you know sophisticated the

241
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,240
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code but it was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked and</font>

242
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,200
not only what I utilize the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

243
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ottoman capability</font>

244
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,130
to auto execute the binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> would also</font>

245
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,990
rely on social engineering as well I

246
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,300
would make the file look like a password

247
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,830
file for the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the thermal imaging</font>

248
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,569
camera I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make it look</font>

249
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a thermal image of a cat which I'll</font>

250
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,180
show you in a bit but yeah it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,830
interesting so there was some issues

252
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,660
here when I started actually deploying

253
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,490
this tool is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

254
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,660
relies on IP address and there's a lot

255
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of problems with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

256
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,860
increasingly so for forensics it

257
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,710
requires a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work by law</font>

258
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,210
enforcement and any law enforcement in

259
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,950
the room not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

260
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,190
sometimes law enforcement don't like to

261
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,750
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paperwork and sometimes</font>

262
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,030
that'll actually have an impact on the

263
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">recovery of your device it's also not</font>

264
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,030
identity so it actually doesn't put the

265
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,100
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directly in front of the</font>

266
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,290
computer you can always say it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

267
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,250
someone else was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using my computer you</font>

268
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,860
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starbucks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or something</font>

269
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,390
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so probable cause was</font>

270
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,950
really it's Annie it's a challenge when

271
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,480
you're dealing with IP address for any

272
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,240
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crime not just recovering stolen</font>

273
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,070
devices it's also not always accurate so

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,650
someone's using a proxy again there are

275
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,270
starbucks something like that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

276
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,579
necessarily you know it's not the

277
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,920
smoking gun that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also in</font>

278
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,880
general just takes a really long time

279
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,800
some of these cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're dealing</font>

280
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">with like recovering a stolen laptop you</font>

281
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,040
know time is of the essence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of</font>

282
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">these cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually take like two</font>

283
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,939
weeks to several months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

284
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,330
recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> just off IP address alone so</font>

285
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,180
it's not particularly a useful piece of

286
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,830
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had the first iPad</font>

287
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,050
recovery as far as I know it's the first

288
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,750
ipod recovery ever using tracking

289
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,930
technology so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm still waiting for my</font>

290
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:50,020
check from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple but you know this was</font>

291
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:51,550
actually jun<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 2013 is that the user</font>

292
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">name was one of the most useful pieces</font>

293
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,990
of information this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kelapa cos</font>

294
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,459
family that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have just happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

295
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,470
the name the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer</font>

296
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,660
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique name there was only</font>

297
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,290
one kid in the school that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> that name</font>

298
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,640
so so you can imagine who had the ipod

299
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,230
but it was interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you know</font>

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,699
it's the first sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of recovery like</font>

301
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,370
this using the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology in</font>

302
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,030
this piece of evidence and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

303
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,240
approached by a

304
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,160
company to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of a customized</font>

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,750
agent that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be installed</font>

306
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,850
on these very high-end<font color="#E5E5E5"> thermal imaging</font>

307
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,970
cameras these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices cost anywhere from</font>

308
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,470
3,000 to 300,000 dollars so they wanted

309
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for tough recovery purposes but also</font>

310
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,030
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these devices are actually</font>

311
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,470
controlled export controlled they did

312
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,060
they were having some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

313
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,730
end up in facilities that they shouldn't

314
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,829
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other sort</font>

315
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of side effects of what they wanted to</font>

316
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,510
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track so for example if one</font>

317
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,540
of these devices ends up in Iran for

318
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,000
example then you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trace</font>

319
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,319
that back to the reseller and then you

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,880
know cancel their license of course

321
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,380
because they basically committed a crime

322
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,050
and so I built this customized agent and

323
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:02,230
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

324
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">used a a little bit of flash memory a</font>

325
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,340
flash card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know if a thief</font>

326
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,750
steals it he could just put a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in</font>

327
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,400
right just get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the old one and</font>

328
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,720
the agents gone so we made a very

329
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,220
persistent we actually wrote it into the

330
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,280
firmware would it would actually write

331
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,460
rewrite the agent on to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file</font>

332
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto the memory card so even if someone</font>

333
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a new one in you're still going to</font>

334
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some persistence there and then i</font>

335
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:28,690
disguised it as this cat photo so and

336
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,790
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

337
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,940
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually found some old</font>

338
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,949
code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind of rehashed you know we</font>

339
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,450
focused mostly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows but people</font>

340
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,470
always say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know max you know</font>

341
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,050
they're not vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this type of</font>

342
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,450
thing and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was working on a</font>

343
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:48,430
USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan for max and what I found was</font>

344
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,740
it was really good to use applescript

345
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,709
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because it's</font>

346
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,300
trusted by the operating system what's

347
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice about Max too is that there</font>

348
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are certain applications that you know</font>

349
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,210
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be on that system like</font>

350
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,250
iTunes for example and there's also

351
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,260
number of other apps that also have

352
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,120
interfaces directly with<font color="#E5E5E5"> applescript so</font>

353
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,830
it's a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> language if you're</font>

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,640
writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a any sort of malware for max</font>

355
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:15,040
that you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that so</font>

356
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,750
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one trip that i did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with OSX</font>

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,010
with a homo glyphs so basically it's

358
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,250
just a character<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like another</font>

359
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,930
character sorry that's really small but

360
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,740
basically there's a protection and an

361
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">OSX where if you try to disguise a file</font>

362
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,830
as something other than a dot app like

363
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,599
if I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a dot mp3 that'll</font>

364
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,580
automatically throw a dot app at the end

365
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,440
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will then you know give</font>

366
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,290
away my my Trojan because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

367
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,700
disguise this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an mp3 file however if</font>

368
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,709
I put what's called an<font color="#E5E5E5"> O gannett</font>

369
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,540
character in there it's a little Turkish

370
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,609
character it's a unicode character that

371
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,300
looks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to a pyramid sorry a</font>

372
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,529
period then actually tricks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it apple</font>

373
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,660
doesn't throw the dot app on the end of

374
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:59,860
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can disguise the file as you</font>

375
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,660
know Justin Beaver mp3 and then I go

376
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,880
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can also modify the</font>

377
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,500
the icon so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make sure that</font>

378
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the mp3 icon that's going to use</font>

379
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">by Apple so it's another just nice way</font>

380
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,680
to just disguise it so here's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

381
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,570
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code it's really simple</font>

382
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,430
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting system information</font>

383
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,080
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple script there's an object</font>

384
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually available that you can</font>

385
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,850
actually quickly grab that information

386
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,010
and then one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do is you</font>

387
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually open up a web browser and</font>

388
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,689
pass data through that way there's other

389
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,479
ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can transmit data but i just</font>

390
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,980
used itunes i was actually able to

391
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,110
encode the data into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a query string and</font>

392
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">then basically make a call out through</font>

393
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,360
itunes and actually if you download this

394
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:47,770
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on USB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacks com you can</font>

395
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,390
download it and it'll it'll actually get

396
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,130
gather information send it off to a

397
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,560
server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it'll actually start</font>

398
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,760
streaming an mp3 from the web server as

399
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">well so while you're gathering</font>

400
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,790
information people are listening to

401
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,000
music as they expect when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they click on</font>

402
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,860
a dot mp3 file right but you know

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,390
luckily with some of the new protections

404
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,610
with a gatekeeper things like that

405
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,260
actually blocks this capability it'll

406
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,770
actually you know give you an alert that

407
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,180
says this isn't a trusted application if

408
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,709
you put this on a flash drive it's not

409
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,899
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you the internet warning</font>

410
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,670
that hey you download this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from the</font>

411
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,870
internet if it's on a flash drive and

412
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,939
you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone and they run it</font>

413
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,760
and they have gatekeeper disable this

414
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,140
will function perfectly fine so I've

415
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,029
actually found a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people actually</font>

416
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">disable gatekeeper just because it's a</font>

417
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,620
nuisance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and it's something you</font>

418
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,329
may want to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your environments</font>

419
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,910
as well because uh some of your

420
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,279
employees might be doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

421
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,420
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a long time ago but USB I</font>

422
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,430
still an attack vector

423
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,709
we see it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much regularly</font>

424
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,790
in the news the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuxnet you know it was</font>

425
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:50,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">initially delivered via USB you also saw</font>

426
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">USB malware that actually hit the</font>

427
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">International Space Station and you know</font>

428
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,829
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys remember how I got there they</font>

429
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,060
had a game on a flash drive and they

430
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,550
brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in to happen to be infected</font>

431
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,138
so it wasn't anywhere on the network or

432
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,180
anything like that but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

433
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:07,180
people with flash drives are very very

434
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,829
dangerous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in 2012 there was a</font>

435
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,050
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> where there were actually two us</font>

436
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,388
power plants that were infiltrated when

437
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,819
an employee brought in an infected USB

438
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,420
stick into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the environment and then at</font>

439
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,510
black hat there was another a whole new

440
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,250
USB exploit that was shown and they

441
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,439
actually scattered a bunch of flash

442
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,360
drives in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel people picked him up</font>

443
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,399
and they plug him into their computer

444
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,139
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> information was gathered the next</font>

445
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,480
day there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other flash drives on the</font>

446
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,560
out there and it was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> copies of</font>

447
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,699
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information they were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

448
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,170
gather so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still still an issue</font>

449
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,569
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a we talked about</font>

450
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know IP address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just one</font>

451
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,740
piece of information but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

452
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,120
it's not just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one piece of</font>

453
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">information you have to actually gather</font>

454
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,220
a lot of data and start connecting dots

455
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,800
this is what I call it's a crazy wall

456
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,730
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen like CSI when you</font>

457
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,260
know they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track a murder</font>

458
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know they have all the different</font>

459
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,339
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have them like a red</font>

460
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,669
string attached to it what's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

461
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:08,049
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually something that a lot of</font>

462
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,600
law enforcement actually utilized to

463
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:12,490
sort of keep track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of evidence and</font>

464
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,319
that's kind of how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think to this stuff</font>

465
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,020
is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier using tools now like</font>

466
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,359
multi go they have case file or multi go

467
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,819
itself those are really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools for</font>

468
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,889
for gathering evidence in making those

469
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,109
connections so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highly recommend</font>

470
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at those but this was back in</font>

471
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,610
the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we even had that stuff so</font>

472
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,090
for example one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the flash drives we</font>

473
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,399
actually be covered someone stole it it

474
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,649
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a professor at a university</font>

475
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,080
he had a lot of sensitive information on

476
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,250
there i'm also a thesis right so he

477
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,389
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back he didn't have it backed</font>

478
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:48,640
up and so he activated tracking and then

479
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,520
we were getting connections from an AT&T

480
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,840
subscriber that's not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful yeah</font>

481
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again if we had go through law</font>

482
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,600
enforcement

483
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,040
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font>

484
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gather that information from</font>

485
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,428
them and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

486
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,880
care but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we started getting</font>

487
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,670
additional pains from a computer lab at

488
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,950
university<font color="#E5E5E5"> of north texas now this got a</font>

489
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,110
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting from here we're</font>

490
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,600
actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with campus</font>

491
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,909
security and IT the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is we had</font>

492
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,199
a timestamp of when that connection

493
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,260
occurred we had the internal network

494
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,880
address we also found that to get into

495
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that computer lab required you to swipe</font>

496
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,020
your student ID card<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the problem is</font>

497
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,270
is that the user names on the computer

498
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,429
wall guess so you know it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

499
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,960
guest<font color="#CCCCCC"> account no you didn't log in with</font>

500
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,110
your student ID or anything like that so

501
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was we knew basically who was in</font>

502
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,409
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room at the time but we couldn't</font>

503
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,290
quite identify you know specifically who

504
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,480
was who had the flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive but we also</font>

505
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,120
found that the computer lab actually had

506
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,340
gotten robbed about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year before and so</font>

507
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,530
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually installed some security</font>

508
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,360
cameras so security cameras also have

509
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,910
logs so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nice is we're actually</font>

510
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,370
able to correlate logs from you know the

511
00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">system from our agent were able to get</font>

512
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">it from the the access card we're also</font>

513
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,990
getting to get footage of who was

514
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually in the room from the camera so</font>

515
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,130
that's a smoking gun we were able to

516
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify who that was and work with</font>

517
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:16,030
campus security to basically stand

518
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,170
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his class and when he came</font>

519
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,280
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're able to get it back from him</font>

520
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:23,110
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really nice so I mean the</font>

521
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,490
devices themselves we also looked at you

522
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,409
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just for flash drives but I</font>

523
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,179
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how can we</font>

524
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,040
also track more expensive devices that

525
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:34,870
people will care about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laptop so</font>

526
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,570
laptops themselves are they're awesome

527
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,340
when it comes to surveillance because of

528
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,820
all the different sensors they actually

529
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,559
have from the web camera to the the

530
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,260
microphone there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of capability</font>

531
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,720
here we can grab screen captures we can

532
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,210
keyloggers things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a lot</font>

533
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of information and we I also looked at</font>

534
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,520
how we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get location</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

535
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,170
Wi-Fi networks so at the time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

536
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,389
around when the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone came out it</font>

537
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,760
didn't have gps it was using Wi-Fi

538
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,410
location so I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting</font>

539
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,149
wouldn't that be useful for tracking

540
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,169
stolen devices

541
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,330
I worked with the company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

542
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,089
had developed that technology to embed

543
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:16,449
that into this software and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font>

544
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:17,918
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful because law enforcement if</font>

545
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,029
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have an IP address again it's</font>

546
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,669
difficult to place that person behind

547
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,989
the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> they also it takes you know</font>

548
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,969
anywhere from two weeks of several

549
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:26,950
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> to locate it but if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

550
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a general location within 20 meters</font>

551
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,940
and you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a photo of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

552
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took it that allows law enforcement</font>

553
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,889
to work very quickly to recover that

554
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,779
device you can also monitor activity

555
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:39,189
that's happening on the system you know

556
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,529
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't want to go too far down</font>

557
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,999
that hole I didn't want to do any sort

558
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:45,129
of screen grabs I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

559
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:47,080
back door in the system I actually found

560
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,998
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other competitors at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

561
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,559
did have that capability they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> deaf</font>

562
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,710
recovery teams where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

563
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,330
the ability to do it use a back door to

564
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,429
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the system install keyloggers</font>

565
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,228
install other<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

566
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:04,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a little scary especially when</font>

567
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:06,879
you're dealing with the enterprise so

568
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:09,580
it's giving example how this works if a

569
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:12,279
laptop gets stolen you activate tracking

570
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,158
and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it'll gather a</font>

571
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,440
photo of the person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took it as well</font>

572
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,729
as network information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other data at</font>

573
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,379
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was a little concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

574
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:22,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to run my own server so i was</font>

575
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,428
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just integrate with Flickr that</font>

576
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,349
was nice because then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font>

577
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,419
worry about any photos in me watching

578
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:29,529
their web camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes directly to</font>

579
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:31,419
their Flickr account that they

580
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,429
authenticated so again it's about

581
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:37,960
balancing the privacy implications of

582
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:40,749
this so the location service I used was

583
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,999
skyhook wireless you know now geo

584
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:44,979
locations basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's commoditized</font>

585
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's embedded and pretty much all the</font>

586
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:48,639
operating systems and all the devices

587
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,969
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there get some water</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

588
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,968
second

589
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,400
so it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> native in OS X Windows</font>

590
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,410
Android or iOS you can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> use google</font>

591
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">maps their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API if you want to write</font>

592
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,040
scripts like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python things like that</font>

593
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,860
where you can actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for free</font>

594
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,000
as well so if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> experimental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

595
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,229
some of these tools i definitely

596
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,020
recommend taking a look at the google

597
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,550
maps api starts kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of long here i'll</font>

598
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,240
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides are available so</font>

599
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,129
you guys can can play with this so the

600
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,290
first actual laptop recovery i had was

601
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,780
actually wasn't a laptop it was an imac

602
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,450
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stolen out of someone's</font>

603
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,670
apartment in brooklyn and so he

604
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,200
activated tracking and we started

605
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,320
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> these interesting photos and</font>

606
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,120
location and law enforcement were really

607
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,379
difficult to deal with they had dealt

608
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,989
with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these tools before</font>

609
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,490
that only got IP address again you know

610
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,780
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really frustrated because it</font>

611
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,300
takes forever he has to follow the

612
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,129
paperwork and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he he didn't quite</font>

613
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,690
understand the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi</font>

614
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,410
positioning within you know it's 20

615
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,720
meters and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said look just print</font>

616
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,370
out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo of the guy go to this</font>

617
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,250
location and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start asking questions</font>

618
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,260
and he's like well yeah don't tell me

619
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,380
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do my job all right you're a cop</font>

620
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,790
and and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> he did he goes</font>

621
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,860
there and they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was</font>

622
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,649
actually the owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a tattoo parlor</font>

623
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,879
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> office in the back and if</font>

624
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the photo you'll see there's</font>

625
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,050
a lot of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool stuff in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

626
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,990
background there's a nice big screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV</font>

627
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this tiny office there's mixers</font>

628
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,320
keyboards all sorts of musical equipment

629
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,669
when law enforcement actually went in

630
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,139
there they actually found three laptops

631
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,510
that were from<font color="#E5E5E5"> different cases as well</font>

632
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,590
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> reported stolen so on this one</font>

633
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we had a four hundred</font>

634
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,050
percent recovery rate but and that was

635
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,840
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting is that you know this</font>

636
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:44,990
sort of provided a trojan into some of

637
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,699
these fencing operations as well then we

638
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,679
had another case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

639
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,170
was the portland schools where I'm from

640
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,150
in Portland Oregon these schools kept

641
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,679
getting hit repeatedly by laptop thieves

642
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,510
they would go in they would steal all

643
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,309
the bunch of computers and I swear a

644
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,809
week later when<font color="#CCCCCC"> their get replaced they</font>

645
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,000
would come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it again very</font>

646
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,320
brazen and you know they're really

647
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,330
frustrated so I work with the school

648
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,950
district I said hey I got an idea let's

649
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,540
install my software on some bait

650
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,010
tops don't lock them up into the

651
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">cupboard I guarantee these guys are</font>

652
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,970
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be back and sure enough they</font>

653
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,010
were we started getting locations from

654
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,200
Vancouver Washington which is just just

655
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,810
across the river from Portland and we

656
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,080
started getting a bunch of photos and

657
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:27,590
then law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> got involved they</font>

658
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,540
went over to this location and they went

659
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,980
and they knocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the door and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

660
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,379
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that the cop knew the guy</font>

661
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,960
who was at the door I mean he's like he

662
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,200
didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this you know it's a the</font>

663
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,750
guy that does my roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know so he</font>

664
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,190
said your technology doesn't work I got

665
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,990
pissed off so I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there myself</font>

666
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually started looking at the</font>

667
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,740
Wi-Fi networks to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

668
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,360
information was correct and so this

669
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,250
building it's again it's within 20

670
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,770
meters it just happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the duplex</font>

671
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:59,810
and so on the other side was really

672
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:01,850
interesting was there was a car and

673
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,710
there was this big Russian pride sticker

674
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,240
on the back of it and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Wi-Fi</font>

675
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,680
networks that we were connecting through

676
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,020
it was Russia that's what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

677
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,550
actually named and then a girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts</font>

678
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes out starts washing the car and</font>

679
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,480
then a guy comes out and it's basically

680
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's this guy right here he comes out</font>

681
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,910
and he looks over at me and I my across

682
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,139
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> street from him and I look like I'm</font>

683
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like looking for directions on my</font>

684
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,860
laptop really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick and then I called</font>

685
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the police and they they actually came</font>

686
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,669
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they started working the case</font>

687
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,649
some more come to find out this was an

688
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,090
organized group there were about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six or</font>

689
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,300
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> different guys that were involved</font>

690
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,070
they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> were had warrants out for</font>

691
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,080
their arrest they recovered the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen</font>

692
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,939
laptop what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting with</font>

693
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,230
this too is that the police never told

694
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,330
them that it was tracking technology

695
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,740
that turned him in they got them to

696
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that they turned each other in</font>

697
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,730
and so they basically ratted on each

698
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,030
other and that's how we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

699
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:56,290
like six or<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was great</font>

700
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:59,810
so then we had another interesting case

701
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:02,570
tracking Victor we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop that was</font>

702
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">stolen and for like two weeks I wasn't</font>

703
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,050
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> any connections I was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

704
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they reformatted the hard drive</font>

705
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,450
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that wiped the</font>

706
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,830
software we're not going to get it back

707
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,770
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started getting these</font>

708
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:15,620
connections and it was in Missouri of

709
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:17,870
all places and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting tons</font>

710
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,370
of photos with this guy in all sorts of

711
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,899
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at one point there</font>

712
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,629
was even a hotel he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in with some</font>

713
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,610
on the background something was going on

714
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:29,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there was he was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very busy guy it</font>

715
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,919
was all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then nice</font>

716
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,170
thing too is that he actually changed

717
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username on his computer to his full</font>

718
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,580
name so that was really helpful I was a

719
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,810
really nice thing for him to do so then

720
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,280
I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we actually</font>

721
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">found a lot more information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

722
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,379
guy we found his myspace profile found

723
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he was really into Scion he's</font>

724
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these cars he loves his cars</font>

725
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,790
so I found that all of his aliases on

726
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,170
these various forums where he's posting

727
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,580
photos of his car which was nice because

728
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,660
then we also had his<font color="#E5E5E5"> license plate</font>

729
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">number yeah it was great he was also a</font>

730
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,830
big power seller on ebay where<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

731
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,790
actually selling car parts so you can

732
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,730
kind of get an idea what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

733
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,170
business he was in and then a really

734
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice guy he ended up selling the laptop</font>

735
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:15,500
to his friend Omar who also he also sold

736
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,990
him a bike that was stolen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he got his</font>

737
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,020
buddies involved in the case as well so

738
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,980
what happened here was his father was

739
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,200
the one that actually gave him the

740
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,640
laptop we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is the sort</font>

741
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,410
of Russian organized crime groups

742
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,360
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Portland and they would</font>

743
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,340
take stolen property put it in a white

744
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,659
van and then they would drive it down to

745
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,399
Missouri and then they would exchange

746
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,200
stolen property because where's the

747
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,600
first place you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look when</font>

748
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,910
your laptop is stolen craigslist right

749
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,469
so this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of helped them get around</font>

750
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,100
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that I mean they just exchanged</font>

751
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of this these stolen goods and yeah</font>

752
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,949
we ended up stopping that pretty quickly

753
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,320
you know other crimes we ended up

754
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,410
solving<font color="#E5E5E5"> too there was a very violent</font>

755
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,679
carjacking him in Brazil two guys were

756
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,540
actually in a car and they were actually

757
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,600
held up at gunpoint told to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

758
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,370
the vehicle the driver<font color="#E5E5E5"> got out they took</font>

759
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the butt of the gun and knock the guy</font>

760
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,610
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat the crap out of them but one of</font>

761
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,610
our customers had his laptop in the back

762
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,800
and started getting pings very shortly

763
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:23,240
thereafter and then we're able to to

764
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:26,120
identify who actually has a laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

765
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,520
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested the two folks that beat</font>

766
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the crap out of the driver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so sometimes</font>

767
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,889
it's not just laptop theft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

768
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,699
crimes that we solve so after laptops I

769
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,130
wanted to

770
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,140
move into mobile which was a little bit

771
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,760
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking at like</font>

772
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,380
geolocation that's easier because it's

773
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,629
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically part of the operating</font>

774
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,770
system so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make API calls you</font>

775
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to do any sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of custom code</font>

776
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,470
development but the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is a much</font>

777
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">more problematic on the carrier side the</font>

778
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,300
IP address changes frequently it's

779
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,370
really difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

780
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,840
person and then photo and contact you

781
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,330
know those privacy challenges with that

782
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,649
so again I was really concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

783
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:08,030
having access to customers information I

784
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,130
figured if I had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hacker could</font>

785
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,480
get into the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again we made</font>

786
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually encrypt the</font>

787
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,990
information on the device before it

788
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,550
actually gets sent to the cloud and this

789
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,680
was all before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fap anang that</font>

790
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,330
happened so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

791
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">know maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was seen in the future I</font>

792
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:26,810
don't know but for this sniffing I she

793
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little video of this one of these</font>

794
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,889
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of sprint stores</font>

795
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually started buying our software and</font>

796
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,500
installing all their demo units because

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having a problem with them</font>

808
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,310
they're very confident that tracking

here and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto their demo phones will</font>

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,840
lead to an arrest this is a

cell phones from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sprint store at</font>

washington square mall on Saturday

moments after surveillance video caught

the theft on tape employees initiated

find the GPS location of the individuals

to to monitor any activity that happens

825
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,140
in the phone that activity turned out to

826
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,120
be pictures someone took shortly after

827
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,890
the phones were stolen tigard police

828
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,750
admit it's a brave new world when

829
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,670
pictures taken on cell phones can be

830

told to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> back pictures once they're</font>

stolen

832
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,270
has not only piqued the interest of our

833
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:56,189
investigators but in essence appears at

834
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,170
this point could be very credible

835
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,490
information for us to follow up on the

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,960
told us off camera a man she called

849
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,909
Peter had sent this photo to her

850
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Saturday evening but says she knew</font>

851
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,290
nothing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phones hi my name's</font>

852
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,330
Abby tracked the second cell phone

853
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,389
signal to this duplex about eight blocks

854
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:42,750
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have an a samsung epic</font>

855
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone into this location thanks for here</font>

856
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,180
yesterday looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're back live</font>

857
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,220
an outside the washington square mall

858
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,370
where we've just obtained within the

859
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,740
hour those DMV records on that temporary

860
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,600
permit<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiger police say they hope the</font>

861
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,450
men in the pictures will contact them

862
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,360
soon so they can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> how their faces</font>

863
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,920
ended up on a stolen cell phone back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

864
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:11,520
you Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eddie teach out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Contra</font>

865
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:13,770
so I was a we had several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of recoveries</font>

866
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,590
that were like that as well and this one

867
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">too when they got these guys were here</font>

868
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,100
six of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is where we</font>

869
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,840
actually went and also in<font color="#E5E5E5"> recover a</font>

870
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,189
stolen vehicle there were actually

871
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,879
warrants out for one of these guys

872
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">already and yeah just kind of an</font>

873
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,630
interesting case so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

874
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,710
interesting to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

875
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,030
amount of information you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get from</font>

876
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,740
images you know there's the images

877
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,170
themselves when we look at surveillance

878
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,280
cameras and with we were actually

879
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:43,620
tracking these devices so the gps<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

880
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,710
location was not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it was</font>

881
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,300
way off for some reason however the

882
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,940
location<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was actually embedded in</font>

883
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,430
the images that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were sent it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

884
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,780
data those were accurate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

885
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great too because it also had a</font>

886
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">timestamp embedded in the photo as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

887
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:02,790
so was able to give us both

888
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:05,190
time in place and so I became<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

889
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:07,170
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the exif data I actually</font>

890
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,760
built a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool called exif scan</font>

891
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,610
where you can actually upload photos and

892
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,010
it'll tell you if there's a serial

893
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:18,449
number embedded into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> image or if</font>

894
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:19,950
there's GPS coordinates and yeah so also

895
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting too is that</font>

896
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trip permit so</font>

897
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:28,830
that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it too easy so if</font>

898
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,720
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at exif data to you know we're</font>

899
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,280
looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we encrypt data images</font>

900
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,800
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I became</font>

901
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interested in the metadata so</font>

902
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,200
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information actually</font>

903
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets embedded in images video and audio</font>

904
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,860
the cell phone cameras will embed GPS

905
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,500
coordinates a lot of times that's by

906
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,169
default there's also a time stamp which

907
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really good for for forensics and I</font>

908
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,830
also found that you know and high-end

909
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,810
digital cameras they will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> embed</font>

910
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,480
the make model and serial number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

911
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:59,250
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> that took the photo into that and</font>

912
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,480
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like what if there was a way</font>

913
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually search for that</font>

914
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,240
information there was sort of a quasi

915
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:10,080
way to do it through flickr but it

916
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't particularly user-friendly so i</font>

917
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,340
built out a tool that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go</font>

918
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,650
out and mine some of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information so</font>

919
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,120
i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here's a list of some of</font>

920
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,918
the core brands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll actually embed</font>

921
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,560
the serial number so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more of the</font>

922
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-end digital cameras so the idea was</font>

923
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,350
that oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could get ahead of</font>

924
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,790
myself yeah so the idea here is that if

925
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,739
you had a search engine where you could

926
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,449
actually search for a serial number

927
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,060
wouldn't it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if your camera was</font>

928
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,409
stolen you know there's a finite image

929
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,239
that's posted on flickr three months

930
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,690
later then you can get your camera back

931
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,489
so just more of a proof of concept so

932
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,639
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a reporter that contacted me</font>

933
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:53,009
when someone had some nude photos leaked

934
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,500
everyone was claiming that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone</font>

935
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,800
was hacked right however the exif data

936
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,080
actually showed that the multiple phones

937
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,500
over the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of several years so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

938
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,480
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking it but he owes research okay</font>

939
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,190
so what this revealed was at the point

940
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,930
of compromise was actually email it

941
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,820
wasn't the phone wasn't hacked itself

942
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,140
and the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did it was actually</font>

943
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,390
chris chaney he

944
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,589
it was able to guess the passwords and

945
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:22,828
now he's serving 10 years in jail so

946
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:24,839
when I started this idea of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exif</font>

947
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">data mining I was actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helping</font>

948
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,759
another startup they basically had a

949
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:32,669
legal botnet sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a study at</font>

950
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,500
home type of thing where organizations

951
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,940
or people could actually give up the

952
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,539
computers idle time to have it due

953
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,160
process jobs right and so I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

954
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,920
to basically several hundred computers

955
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,629
in multiple places where I could

956
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,240
actually deploy an agent that would go

957
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,339
out and scan like all of Flickr for

958
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,839
example and actually extract that

959
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:55,288
information and then create a big

960
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">database and it was nice because if you</font>

961
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,569
did this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like a couple of</font>

962
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:59,670
computers it would take years there were

963
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:02,490
billions of images we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

964
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire olive flicker at that time</font>

965
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it took about about three weeks or</font>

966
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:12,029
so so I also found those other websites

967
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,400
500 pics panoramio<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to also</font>

968
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:15,990
get it the data from twitpic as well as

969
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,130
Twitter although<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter at the time</font>

970
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,319
when you upload an image you would

971
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,529
actually remove all the exif data the

972
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,660
icon image like for your profile photo

973
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:26,880
it would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the exif data at</font>

974
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,109
that time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

975
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,329
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to have these tiny</font>

976
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:32,400
little images but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to extract</font>

977
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:34,440
all this data from that so that was kind

978
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,029
of an interesting case so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it</font>

979
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks was you know we would basically</font>

980
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:40,680
mine all this image we loaded into a

981
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:42,210
database and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do a search</font>

982
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,980
for your serial number and then it'll

983
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,140
show you the results of the images that

984
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">we found online that were were taken</font>

985
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,400
with that camera I put it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there just</font>

986
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">as something free I was just kind of</font>

987
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,440
curious if this would work and it did

988
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:57,119
this guy John Heller he had a camera

989
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,250
stolen he was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on assignment for</font>

990
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,630
Getty Images about seven thousand

991
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,240
dollars worth of camera equipment was

992
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,730
gone he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned around and his bag</font>

993
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,519
was was swiped it was at the egyptian

994
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">theater he did a search he was able to</font>

995
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that there was some images that were</font>

996
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,480
uploaded to flickr he was able to map

997
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:17,579
that to a facebook profile of another

998
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,319
professional photographer and that

999
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,230
professional photographer actually had

1000
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,609
photos of his his gear and we were able

1001
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see that hey there's his camera right</font>

1002
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,549
there so the LAPD was involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1003
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,680
case

1004
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point and so what happened</font>

1005
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,210
was the guy robbed the camera he then

1006
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,400
sold it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on craigslist pretty shortly</font>

1007
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,520
thereafter was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who bought it from</font>

1008
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,050
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> on craigslist sold it on ebay and</font>

1009
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,300
then the guy that actually had it you

1010
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,480
know were basically you know two people

1011
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,760
deep here and then they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1012
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,860
that camera back that guy actually the

1013
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,570
LAPD<font color="#CCCCCC"> were kind of jerks to him he had to</font>

1014
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get a lawyer to explain what</font>

1015
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,880
happened but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to to get it</font>

1016
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">back so they went to the ebay seller</font>

1017
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,930
they went to the craigslist buyer they

1018
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,700
went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the apartment of where this</font>

1019
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,589
guy bought it on craigslist this is a

1020
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,819
year later they go in and there's all

1021
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,680
kinds of stolen property in the

1022
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,360
apartment much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other cameras and</font>

1023
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,980
things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1024
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because you know at the time</font>

1025
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,670
that technology didn't really exist or

1026
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,610
really wasn't a way to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that piece</font>

1027
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of evidence but just unveiling this</font>

1028
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,360
little tiny piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information we're</font>

1029
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to actually solve crimes and retro</font>

1030
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,640
actively go back and identify where the

1031
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,129
camera was so you know with that there's

1032
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:34,799
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i had that were</font>

1033
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:36,930
similar that we had another case where a

1034
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,170
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> was selling a camera on craigslist</font>

1035
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:43,350
as you just start<font color="#CCCCCC"> calling a theft list</font>

1036
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:45,840
her crime list but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was selling he was</font>

1037
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,790
going to move and he he had this guy

1038
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,930
come out and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was gonna buy it brought</font>

1039
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">him out to his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> garage to show him the</font>

1040
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,049
camera the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pops him right in</font>

1041
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,600
the face knocks him down to the ground

1042
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and runs off with the camera and then</font>

1043
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the tool he was able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1044
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,210
find a bunch of images that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

1045
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,920
actually uploaded and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1046
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,210
started gathering some other information

1047
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,520
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy we started actually</font>

1048
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,970
scanning you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other photo</font>

1049
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,740
websites he was a professional DJ and a

1050
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,970
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> photographer what's</font>

1051
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,470
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that he would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

1052
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,359
these high-end cameras that he had

1053
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,919
almost every few months so there was

1054
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,860
actually probably 20 different cameras

1055
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,530
that he was actually using so he's

1056
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:25,980
either very successful or those cameras

1057
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,420
might be stolen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he also uploaded</font>

1058
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,400
a lot of photos that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were rather</font>

1059
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:33,240
incriminating he'd like to take pictures

1060
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of his weed the unlicensed firearm</font>

1061
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,229
showing how how hardcore II is has also

1062
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,660
taken a picture of

1063
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,090
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> girlfriend smoking weed driving down</font>

1064
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,129
the highway and what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice too</font>

1065
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,450
is that he was nice enough to take a

1066
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:51,040
photo of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a speedometer again was GPS we</font>

1067
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,500
had GPS coordinates and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp on</font>

1068
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this as well where he's going over 100</font>

1069
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,310
miles an hour smoking weed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1070
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:02,589
freeway so law enforcement really like

1071
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:04,600
this information this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the the</font>

1072
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">active tool was all I was reached out to</font>

1073
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,319
buy the buy ice they want to actually

1074
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,590
use this for their child exploitation

1075
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigation unit this is a really cool</font>

1076
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,990
group they do some really interesting

1077
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,600
things where they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

1078
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,890
identify like if there's a these guys

1079
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing things in</font>

1080
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,100
forums and they post photos they try to

1081
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,900
get the kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> back before anything bad</font>

1082
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,600
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1083
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,930
they wanted to use this tool the idea

1084
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,170
was that you know if if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe perv is you</font>

1085
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:34,000
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using want this camera for you know</font>

1086
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,250
taking photos of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> family</font>

1087
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,320
Disneyland things like that they'd be

1088
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:42,520
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify who that specifically</font>

1089
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:44,290
was so you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of led me to like</font>

1090
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,730
really research and stuff and I there's

1091
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,200
this guy named Edmund Lockhart and

1092
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,180
there's this thing called the cars

1093
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,129
exchange principle he's sort of the

1094
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,259
grandfather of forensic science and many

1095
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,780
respects<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time he was dealing more</font>

1096
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,640
with physical crimes where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

1097
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,200
that every contact leaves a trace so

1098
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,490
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the criminal he leaves</font>

1099
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and he takes something with</font>

1100
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,540
him it whenever a crime is<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed</font>

1101
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,700
this is sort of a precursor<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

1102
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,020
things like DNA and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1103
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,279
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this carries over</font>

1104
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,410
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital world as well</font>

1105
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,390
increasingly so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a matter of</font>

1106
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,069
you know identifying technologies to

1107
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:18,819
gather that evidence or knowing where to

1108
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:21,100
look and having access to that data so

1109
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,500
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at things like a social</font>

1110
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,700
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> number an IP address we have</font>

1111
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,650
all these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of information</font>

1112
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,259
that you know by themselves they don't

1113
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify a person sometimes but</font>

1114
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,109
if we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all these</font>

1115
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,700
different pieces of data and then we

1116
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:35,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlate them we're able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1117
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,930
create a very rich profile of an

1118
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,819
individual and then we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1119
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,440
like the internet of things like all the

1120
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,390
data that's actually being generated as

1121
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,550
a result of that it's actually gonna

1122
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:48,850
make forensics a very interesting in the

1123
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:51,190
future you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Smart Watch or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1124
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,058
know all your smart devices can actually

1125
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically be</font>

1126
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,839
a snitch on you if you're committing

1127
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:57,849
crimes but that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also be</font>

1128
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,349
used against you so I used a lot of

1129
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,029
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools in this data to track</font>

1130
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:03,609
criminals but criminals can use this to

1131
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:05,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">track you and I look at things the</font>

1132
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:07,299
interaction of things and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1133
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:09,699
classify the data in a few different

1134
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:12,459
different ways first there's data that's

1135
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:14,769
created by us and that's information

1136
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:16,299
that we're aware of things like contacts

1137
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:17,649
you know we send our emails these are

1138
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:20,199
things were conscious of we know we're

1139
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:22,329
generating this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have we feel</font>

1140
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,150
like we have some control over it then

1141
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:26,920
there's data that's created for us so

1142
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:30,219
everything from news feeds a lot of

1143
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,569
other data it's basically information

1144
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:33,099
that's stored somewhere we may not have

1145
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:35,380
control of that we may not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1146
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,869
delete that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and then there's</font>

1147
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,249
data created about us so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when we</font>

1148
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,559
start getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the over</font>

1149
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:43,419
invasive marketing efforts right we

1150
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,499
always hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data all the</font>

1151
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,779
information that's actually being

1152
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:49,448
collected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and analyzed and then there's</font>

1153
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:51,099
what I call boogie data so this is data

1154
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:52,839
that you know at the time it may not

1155
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,819
seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's incriminating or can I</font>

1156
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:56,589
can't identify anybody but within the

1157
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:58,329
right context or you know further<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

1158
00:42:56,589 --> 00:43:00,759
the road it could so I would even

1159
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:03,939
classify things like breach data like

1160
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:05,679
Ashley Madison right so those people

1161
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:07,178
believe that they their privacy was

1162
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,339
being protected they had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1163
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:11,529
information could be hacked or we be

1164
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:13,119
available out there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's information</font>

1165
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:15,339
that you know it's some point down the

1166
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,499
down the road we can come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1167
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:19,989
can haunt us and I actually started

1168
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:22,598
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company in Portland where</font>

1169
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:24,219
we built a mobile application that will

1170
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,140
actually identify mobile application

1171
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:29,109
what mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps are doing on your phone</font>

1172
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,879
so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this app</font>

1173
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,949
has certain permissions but what

1174
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,529
information is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gathering we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1175
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:36,910
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times like a simple screen saver</font>

1176
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,429
app will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be gathering location</font>

1177
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:42,428
information we also found that a bunch

1178
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information like imsi and imei which</font>

1179
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:45,429
are unique identifiers for your phone

1180
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,069
we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being gathered and sent</font>

1181
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:50,109
to a server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and so we did a</font>

1182
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:51,308
report on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well but you can</font>

1183
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually download this app it's free</font>

1184
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:54,849
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to sort of see</font>

1185
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:57,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> secret lives of the apps that you're</font>

1186
00:43:54,849 --> 00:44:00,029
on your phone right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only for</font>

1187
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:00,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android but</font>

1188
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:08,499

1189
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:10,209

1190
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:14,158
so if anybody has any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1191
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:14,158

1195
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:38,078

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reports that are there where</font>

1197
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">we actually found these libraries for</font>

1198
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,259
advertising networks and things like

1199
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:46,359
that that's what's actually gathering

1200
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:48,130
all this imei data and sending it as

1201
