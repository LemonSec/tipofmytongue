1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,440
well welcome everybody my name is Jim

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,440
Penrose and the EVP of cyber

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,730
intelligence at dark trace apologize for

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260
a slight delay getting started we were

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,820
just working through the projector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,800
getting everything set up right had a

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,210
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> power bump here so it's like</font>

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,980
gremlins are everywhere you know every

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I do a demo or presentation they</font>

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,420
follow me<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,710
that's what happened today so what I'm

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,920
concept that there's no such thing as a

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,900
coincidence at our<font color="#E5E5E5"> world cyber</font>

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence and I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,010
how you know I see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and how we</font>

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">can discover new cyber threats using you</font>

18
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,769
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept of making cyber</font>

19
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:41,440
intelligence of discipline instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:44,710
just a data feed so a little bit about

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,879
me I spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 14 months working at</font>

22
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,010
dark trace as the VP of cyber

23
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,928
intelligence what I do for dark trace is

24
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,789
assess the cyber threats that we that we

25
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">see coming inbound to our customers</font>

26
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,649
North America so across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pitch will</font>

27
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,299
see different you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,370
techniques or tactics being used by

29
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:01,989
adversaries like malbert izing or other

30
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,669
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unique you know social</font>

31
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,740
engineering attacks and we'll see that

32
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,380
affecting credit unions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada all</font>

33
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,789
the way through you know law<font color="#CCCCCC"> firms in</font>

34
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,560
Los Angeles and it's kind of interesting

35
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,150
how you'll see it kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sweep across</font>

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,270
North America and appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

37
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,100
ways but regardless of the of the actual

38
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,770
details and you know the domain names

39
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the malicious you know attributes</font>

40
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,649
that are used a lot of times it's the

41
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,600
same tactic being applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> in different</font>

42
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,730
places but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a slightly slightly</font>

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,860
different sort of you know indicator

44
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised so I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

45
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that those challenges as we go through</font>

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,410
the talk today<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent 17</font>

47
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,570
years working at the National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security</font>

48
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,369
Agency working on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the variants of</font>

49
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,789
computer network operations so you know

50
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,740
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had cyber as a buzzword we</font>

51
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,360
had CNO computer network operation so

52
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,759
worked on the computer network defense

53
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,240
defending and it says internal networks

54
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,760
but also looking outwardly at foreign

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,259
cyber threats and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you know</font>

56
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,430
the nature of those threats and turning

57
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,600
that into you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intelligence</font>

58
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,580
products that we would share with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,289
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know CIA and all the other</font>

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">agencies in the US the DoD that would</font>

61
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,310
take action on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font>

62
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,800
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FBI running investigations</font>

63
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,929
into those intrusions you know it was

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">really useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not just spend time on</font>

65
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,469
the defensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> side but also on the more</font>

66
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,019
aggressive offensive side doing

67
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,769
espionage because what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it helps</font>

68
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,630
you appreciate

69
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,860
different approaches you can take to get

70
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,990
into a network and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

71
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,730
context you're able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

72
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,410
inform your decisions when it comes to

73
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,480
how to defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself and where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

74
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,030
concentrate your efforts in time to

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,310
protect your network and like most

76
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,930
people after a September 11th I stepped

77
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,780
into a counterterrorism role and used

78
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,880
cyber operations as a technique to go

79
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,190
after terrorist targets and figure out

80
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,530
their plans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> intentions and uncover</font>

81
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,300
conspiracies in product in progress

82
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,410
finally the last thing I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on was</font>

83
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,360
this office called the operational

84
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovery center and the goal of that</font>

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,880
office was to figure out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unknown</font>

86
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,100
unknowns<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might imagine Edward</font>

87
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Snowden leaked a lot of information</font>

88
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,040
sensitive information about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,859
national<font color="#CCCCCC"> security agency operates and</font>

90
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,600
there was a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recoup a lot of lost</font>

91
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,310
sources and methods and and you know

92
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,230
cyber threat targets that were out there

93
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,570
operating who we lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> sight of when</font>

94
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,429
those revelations<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened so so that</font>

95
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,840
was the goal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

96
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,670
particular office I was working in was

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
to try to find those unknown unknowns

98
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,170
and get new leads and figure out where

99
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,940
to go next so for me you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

100
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,980
formative experience thinking of this as

101
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,260
a cyber intelligence professional here

102
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,480
in the private sector now this happened

103
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,410
to me when I was you know working in the

104
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,510
office of sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and support information</font>

105
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,530
ops at NSA and I'm what getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to</font>

106
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,239
leave for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and I'm walking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

107
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hall and I walked past the</font>

108
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,380
conference room and what do I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

109
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,120
there I see on CNN this breaking news

110
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,579
that there's this black out sweeping

111
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,860
across the Northeast including Toronto

112
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,330
as well and it really you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

113
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,590
struck me might you know my heart sank

114
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,720
when I saw it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I thought to</font>

115
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">myself oh man did just less than two</font>

116
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,590
years after September 11 did we miss

117
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,150
another big indication somewhere in the

118
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,290
intelligence community maybe there's

119
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,970
going to be a cyber attack or something

120
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,410
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn the lights out now you</font>

121
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,270
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a cyber attack</font>

122
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,220
right it was simply just power lines

123
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,560
knock down a cascading blackout occurred

124
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,090
right but it's emblematic of the thing

125
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,620
that you never want to happen to you as

126
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,330
an intelligence professional right you

127
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,490
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see things show up on the</font>

128
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,890
news once it gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news it's no</font>

129
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer intelligence right it's news and</font>

130
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,729
that means something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad had to happen</font>

131
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,099
the conspiracy that was hatched had to

132
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,570
go all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way through and be run you</font>

133
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,400
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a cyber attack or a</font>

134
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack that's that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fail</font>

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">state an epic fail right if you're in</font>

136
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,700
the intelligence business and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

137
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,620
times you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when cyber we spend a lot</font>

138
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time</font>

139
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,530
optimizing how we respond right to

140
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,510
incidents and how we clean up and and

141
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,130
how good we are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those scenarios but</font>

142
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,570
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end that's not intelligence right</font>

143
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,060
that's that's a response action that's

144
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,250
news and and and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know</font>

145
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information is like a day late and</font>

146
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,340
a dollar short right so if we're going

147
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop a competency of discovering</font>

148
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,049
unknowns and novel threats and and and

149
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
the unknown unknown cyber threats we

150
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,830
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep you know polishing our</font>

151
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,510
current process it's not going to work

152
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,010
right we're really in the business right

153
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,020
now of watching the news right and

154
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,880
watching a news in an OP Center you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

155
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,219
that was that was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because if</font>

156
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,290
it showed up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation center we</font>

157
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,000
saw that there was a crisis we knew that

158
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,490
we had missed something serious and we

159
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,410
hadn't done our job right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the nice</font>

160
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,730
thing about Twitter is I used to have a

161
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,500
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here that wasn't it wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

162
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,850
real picture of the outage you know you

163
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,190
can see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still some light in</font>

164
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,470
the Northeast here after<font color="#E5E5E5"> they after the</font>

165
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,150
outage happen and somebody had tweeted

166
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,260
to me last week when i briefed a picture

167
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,820
that showed it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

168
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,170
black he's like you know that's like

169
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,520
photoshopped right that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

170
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,890
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look it up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> snopes</font>

171
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,390
and it's like oh so the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

172
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter is you know you get that</font>

173
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback within minutes of your briefing</font>

174
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,609
usually so if anybody has a anything

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,230
they'd like to help to improve my

176
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,460
briefing please please tweet me after

177
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,120
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead and put it right</font>

178
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,280
on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what I'm going to talk</font>

179
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,420
about now is this this concept of cyber

180
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,239
threat intelligence integration because

181
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,130
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think many many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

182
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,560
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a cyber intelligence data feed</font>

183
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,870
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the way they're going</font>

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,630
to receive indications and warning of

185
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,910
new and novel threats but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

186
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge that assumption and an</font>

187
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,930
assertion that that's what you get from

188
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,880
a cyber intelligence data feed what I'd

189
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,680
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a thesis instead is</font>

190
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,360
that you need to have your people

191
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,740
thinking in the mindset of an

192
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,480
intelligence professional when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

193
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,630
to doing cyber threat intelligence and

194
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,460
using a different approach to figure out

195
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,020
what an adversary is likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

196
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,060
how they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute a targeted</font>

197
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,349
attack against your enterprise you know

198
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,520
the way an apt would think are<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

199
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,950
sophisticated cyber criminal so what's

200
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gartner's definition of cyber threat</font>

201
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,539
intelligence it's this gobbledygook you

202
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,940
know half a half a paragraph definition

203
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,110
my definition simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> its information</font>

204
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,740
used to determine where and how you've

205
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">been poned</font>

206
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,289
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much all it is right and</font>

207
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,080
that's what you're getting out of most

208
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,340
cyber threat intelligence beads today

209
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,380
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the typical cyber threat</font>

210
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,349
intelligence feed the IP addresses that

211
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,969
hackers are using to do their<font color="#CCCCCC"> dirty work</font>

212
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:57,069
domain names at<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs that they use to</font>

213
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,870
execute their social engineering or

214
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,120
their attacks or you know commanding

215
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,550
control infrastructure etc email

216
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,080
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the same and then of</font>

217
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the signatures of malware that</font>

218
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,199
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using whether the our signatures</font>

219
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,318
or hashes or you name it any of those

220
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,699
various tactics or approaches to figure

221
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,819
out if a piece of malware was already

222
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,860
known as bad now<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a process</font>

223
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,300
perspective right we we're really good

224
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,099
at cross-referencing this information

225
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,780
right we have a lot of security events

226
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,490
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> our big pile of security events</font>

227
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,989
we cross-reference it versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> and threat</font>

228
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,870
intelligence and now we've got a pile of

229
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,250
bad right mostly right we know it's bad

230
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,620
there's probably some false positives in

231
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,940
there but but we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> no right now</font>

232
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,650
we've successfully identified and we

233
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,750
kind of like give ourselves a pat on the

234
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,039
back yes I found some bad stuff and we

235
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,169
should do you know response and

236
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,789
remediation but there's this other

237
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,520
problem right you get the false negative

238
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,830
here if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cross-reference that</font>

239
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">results in a hit right congratulations</font>

240
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,758
you may be patient zero now right you're

241
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the victim of a targeted attack somebody</font>

242
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,080
loves you right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting</font>

243
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,000
personal attention as an individual as a

244
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,949
company as someone who's a part of the

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,050
critical infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

246
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,849
expect this right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like</font>

247
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,560
how a little old me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I just run a</font>

248
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,630
I just run a telco I mean who cares

249
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">about telcos everybody cares about</font>

250
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,419
telcos of you know what do you think

251
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,400
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think espionage actors go</font>

252
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,900
after all day long and why they need

253
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,729
information on who calls who when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

254
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,539
where and how right so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you're</font>

255
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle of that</font>

256
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,229
Malstrom same thing with power companies

257
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,930
or anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does that kind of work</font>

258
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,880
of providing public utilities there's

259
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,159
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a never-ending source of</font>

260
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,530
attacks coming your way from

261
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,940
sophisticated actors<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you</font>

262
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,860
know the basic bag of tricks but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

263
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,599
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> emphasize here that a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

267

know the attacker wants to hide those

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,088
identities and obfuscate those

269
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,430

enable you know

those unknown pieces of infrastructure

275
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,649
to enable their social engineering and

276
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
then once they've gained initial point

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,020
Rome typically is not built in a day in

292
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,040
these big data breaches you know you

293
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,449
don't you don't get hacked in the

294
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,399
morning and by the afternoon lose lose

295
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,080
your entire lunch it usually takes a

296
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,339
little while to for the attacker to

297
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,630
position themselves and then once they

298
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,399
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right perch they're going to</font>

299
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,200
put in remote access tools and something

300
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,380
for persistent access so that they can

301
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,940
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the same place again and in</font>

302
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,649
some cases they can escalate their

303
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,380
privileges they may even control your

304
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:49,500
entire network like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

305
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Saudi Aramco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in even 2012 they had</font>

306
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,690
a 20,000 of their machines wiped out on

307
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,920
one day by a network attack so that's

308
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,050
what happens right when you lose control

309
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your administrative platforms inside</font>

310
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,770
your network and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage can</font>

311
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,330
ensue if you you have an attacker that

312
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't care about those ramifications</font>

313
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,310
or doing it on purpose so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

314
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit now specifically about</font>

315
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,279
the cyber threat intelligence data feeds

316
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,529
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are using them as a</font>

317
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,150
yardstick to measure badness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

318
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,740
know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speed of those updates are</font>

319
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,569
critical because if you are going to use

320
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it operationally they need to get to you</font>

321
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,290
in a timely fashion but then you get

322
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">into this kind of situation where if bad</font>

323
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,860
reputation is ascribed to an IP address

324
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">or domain name or whatever then the</font>

325
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,760
question is well how long does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

326
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:32,459
the bad reputation I heard of a company

327
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some automation put in and they</font>

328
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using one of these threat</font>

329
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,990
intelligence feeds and and found out

330
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter addresses had been</font>

331
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,620
used by hackers right they were tweeting

332
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,209
out some<font color="#E5E5E5"> situ into Twitter and just</font>

333
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,860
reading it from Twitter for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command</font>

334
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> control so obviously that means</font>

335
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,430
Twitter is used as infrastructure where

336
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,689
hackers so block Twitter right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

337
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">the logical conclusion right so they</font>

338
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,850
added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cyber threat intelligence</font>

339
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,770
feed and they start blocking Twitter

340
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,180
well the marketing department and sales

341
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> every de starts going bananas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

342
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,599
company kick<font color="#CCCCCC"> about jobs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter went</font>

343
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,310
away right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there how that why</font>

344
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,260
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter gone away and they eventually</font>

345
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,000
hunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down to the security department</font>

346
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,960
who had the you know automagic blocker

347
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,980
turned on for things

348
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,350
we're coming in that cyber threat

349
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,550
intelligence feed right so man i love

350
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,230
automation as much as the next guy but

351
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,329
this is a quality question right in

352
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of what happens right if you turn</font>

353
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and the bad reputation pervades</font>

354
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,720
you know your process and then you start

355
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,910
interrupting mission in terms of what

356
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve so you know</font>

357
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question you sort of end up with is</font>

358
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,339
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better right I mean</font>

359
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,079
everybody is out there I think at least

360
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">in America and the US government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

361
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,280
this overall assertion that you know the

362
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,780
lack of sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know is the primary</font>

363
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,670
issue right if we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had more</font>

364
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,459
sharing on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different fronts of</font>

365
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,280
this threat intelligence we'd be we'd be

366
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,720
better off but um you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> often you</font>

367
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,550
know remind groups that you know the

368
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,200
bigger the tent right for sharing

369
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,729
arrangements the more likely you are to

370
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,230
have the adversary literally sitting in

371
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,480
the tent there with you listening to the

372
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,070
conversation and you know these are

373
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,260
smart adversaries right they realize

374
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they they look into the you know</font>

375
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,980
into the stream and they see themselves

376
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,720
well I've probably been found out there

377
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,220
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I shouldn't use that same IP</font>

378
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
address you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like it's just</font>

379
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,780
basic common sense but<font color="#CCCCCC"> to assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

380
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,430
can vet people out in those scenarios

381
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,720
may not be really really appropriate so

382
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,099
you left with this kind of like need

383
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,600
more cowbell situation right it's just

384
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,010
like that saturday night live skit right

385
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,020
banging the cowbell harder didn't make

386
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,460
the music any better<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's why it</font>

387
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,079
was a funny skit and same thing with

388
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,880
threat intelligence right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

389
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,230
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of more sharing it's not just a</font>

390
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more feeds and more data</font>

391
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,050
and more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tent right you</font>

392
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,760
actually have to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem as</font>

393
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,069
an intelligence professional and realize

394
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,080
right that the paradigm we're employing

395
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just isn't getting you there from here</font>

396
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,160
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discovering novel cyber</font>

397
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,260
threats and figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know those</font>

398
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,120
targeted attacks in the nascent<font color="#E5E5E5"> stages</font>

399
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,380
right before it's in the news right

400
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence</font>

401
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,250
work is getting inside the conspiracy

402
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,620
and breaking it up you know when I

403
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,620
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in counterterrorism the best work</font>

404
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,060
we did were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to line news stories in AFP</font>

405
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,830
about some guy that was arrested in an

406
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,810
apartment in Belgium right was a great

407
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,370
counter terrorism win to you it was

408
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,890
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it was a blip on the radar</font>

409
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,270
that's good intelligence work right when

410
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,890
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to report to the c-suite</font>

411
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,880
of the board you had a massive data

412
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,290
breach and you're cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and</font>

413
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">here here's our great response plan</font>

414
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,339
right you don't want to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

415
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,030
smoking crater right you just want to

416
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get ahead of it so again right talk</font>

417
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,470
about those cyber threat intelligence

418
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,730
feeds so if somebody has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know go</font>

419
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,350
through a cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting</font>

420
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,209
act and doing an investigation in

response and getting to the bottom of it

422
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,829
and it takes two hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight days</font>

423
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,389
or some other number I mean I somebody

424
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,189
from verizon told me this from from the

425

2015 report I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't actually found</font>

people more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than six months of</font>

433
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,459
processing and all that and while you're

434
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,380
while you're waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the update to</font>

435
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,359
come in with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new IPs and domain</font>

436
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,470
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are bad and adversaries</font>

437
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,029
having their way with you right

438
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,079
strategically right this isn't this

439
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,540
isn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the place</font>

440
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,099
where you're avoiding strategic surprise

441
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,290
and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the third party</font>

442
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,699
tells you you know the payment card

443
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,589
processor saying hey I'm seeing a

444
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,849
concentration of a fraud coming from

445
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,029
your company did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that and you</font>

446
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,410
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well me no no no there was a</font>

447
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,209
concentration for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from me and</font>

448
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,069
then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you dig into it you find</font>

449
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">out Oh indeed I did have you know</font>

450
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened in my point of</font>

451
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,860
sale systems or databases or whatever so

452
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,990
what's the coin of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the realm for hackers</font>

453
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,600
intelligence services and thieves well

454
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,339
personally identifiable information they

455
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,649
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get that stuff because of course</font>

456
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,050
that's how you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know can do identity</font>

457
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,670
theft and fraud left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right pH</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes</font>

458
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,189
even a more valuable version of the same

459
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,229
same kind of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> financial info</font>

460
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,699
email creds social social media

461
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,800
credentials and I'll stop there for a

462
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,870
moment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about what happened with</font>

463
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,410
the US Central Command so us CENTCOM is

464
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,720
the one is the military unit or command

465
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,670
that's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for operating against</font>

466
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,139
Isis in the Middle East<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well</font>

467
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's good and they have a Twitter</font>

468
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,100
account that they use right to tweet out

469
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">their public affairs information well</font>

470
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,089
somehow Twitter you know that their

471
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,339
account was compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Isis started</font>

472
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,050
logging in at CENTCOM and posting out

473
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,279
tweets you know it's like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

474
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,839
like beating yourself with your own hand

475
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
right you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wow man this is</font>

476
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,130
terrible right where we lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of</font>

477
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,410
our own message and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were</font>

478
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,209
saying you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> must have just been</font>

479
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody guess the guys you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

480
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,449
handle or did the password reset and you

481
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,430
know what walked through the process I

482
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,959
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so have you guys ever tried</font>

483
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,939
like resetting your password on Twitter

484
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,890
you have to like submit a DNA sample to

485
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,410
do that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's craziness right so</font>

486
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,790
clearly you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody got pwned its</font>

487
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,110
income right somewhere along the way

488
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who had the creds</font>

489
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,649
and they were presumably probably pwned

490
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,470
through social social engineering

491
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,970
operations using social media right why

492
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,459
because that's their job right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they read</font>

493
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff they have to it's the human</font>

494
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,579
frailty of the business right and

495
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,529
whatever business you're in people are

496
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:48,269
going to get pwned so you know it's not

497
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,410
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of training right oh you</font>

498
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,029
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training</font>

499
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,560
program to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that final five percent</font>

500
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,750
of the the dead Enders who keep clicking

501
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,029
on spam and you know going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

502
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,140
watering holes and getting hacked you're

503
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,339
not going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

504
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a billion dollars a day and you</font>

505
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't get the last five percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

506
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,100
so just throw that strategy out and

507
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,890
pursue another strategy that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

508
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,510
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the leg up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this space and</font>

509
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,310
then phone numbers so all this

510
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,829
information is kind of dual-use stuff

511
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual-use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that you can monetize this</font>

512
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,279
and do a fraud activity right and that's

513
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,649
and you see a lot of that right that

514
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,990
happens on routinely the other use is

515
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's grist for the mill of espionage</font>

516
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,660
this is how intelligence operators

517
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,219
figure out who who the targets are who

518
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,439
they ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and craft those</font>

519
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,180
operations to gain access to tailor them

520
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,760
specifically to the targets they're

521
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,640
going after so even though it may not

522
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into something that's monetized you</font>

523
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,300
know from from any of these different

524
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacks that happens it may be very well</font>

525
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,680
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a very specific specific</font>

526
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,769
targeted attack against a key person to

527
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,819
gain access to a network so now i'm

528
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,160
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some case study</font>

529
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,839
examples so you had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation with</font>

530
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">turbotax and at first when it happened</font>

531
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,230
it was like tax season in<font color="#E5E5E5"> america and</font>

532
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,449
everybody thought that turbo tax was

533
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,220
hacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh god right that's terrible well</font>

534
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,109
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean maybe there were a few</font>

535
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,400
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> TurboTax</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts where people are</font>

536
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,049
masquerading into him and trying to

537
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">change you know the bank account info</font>

538
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:11,790
where the refund went but that was the

539
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,089
very minimal sort of amount of that was

540
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,139
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was really happening is</font>

541
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,359
information was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

542
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,490
essentially just use TurboTax as a

543
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,369
vessel p I i was being filed into

544
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,980
turbotax and submitted to you know the

545
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,319
different state you know IRS agencies

546
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,210
right the tax agencies to get refunds

547
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,700
and have accredited to debit cards or

548
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,080
what have you now that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

549
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,870
that was really hard to detect because

550
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,918
it wasn't really hacking per se right a

551
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,809
lot of the people didn't even

552
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,700
necessarily file their taxes online

553
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,010
before right I mean what if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had</font>

554
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,110
the information but no one had ever

555
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,030
held themselves of online filing this is

556
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,649
the first time right so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they do</font>

557
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,270
well you have to pick this you know

558
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">security question right you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

559
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know two-factor authentication</font>

560
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,920
thing and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get a text messager</font>

561
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,240
dude if it's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you just put</font>

562
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,580
in your own number right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this is</font>

563
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">not rocket science right so so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

564
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,179
what was happening right is it is they

565
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,209
were able to monetize you know a

566
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,310
substantial amount of that PII because

567
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,960
it was it was essentially on governed on

568
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">governed territory and they had the</font>

569
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,740
targets the people who were the target

570
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,480
the citizens who they were filing the

571
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,770
tax returns on behalf of had never

572
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,160
availed themselves at the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

573
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,920
first place so where does all that PII

574
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,510
come from well you probably all remember

575
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,060
the anthem breach of a major US

576
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare provider and if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

577
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of data that was breached and</font>

578
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,870
anthem what do you find names Social

579
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,610
Security numbers date of birth addresses

580
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,949
phone numbers email addresses income

581
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,899
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wager to guess the number</font>

582
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,510
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> children you have is in there you</font>

583
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,090
know that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information looks</font>

584
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:48,060
suspiciously similar to what's required

585
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fill out your taxes in America okay</font>

586
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,100
so there you go right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

587
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hop skip and a jump from this kind</font>

588
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,840
of pilfered PII to the monetized fraud

589
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,629
activity that was happening and the

590
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">stealing of data by a turbo tax as the</font>

591
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,060
vessel to achieve that it to achieve

592
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,040
that end so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this as</font>

593
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,110
the as the attacker right you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

594
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,820
to you just have to string together it's

595
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,820
kind of like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX utilities right</font>

596
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,080
you know you can you know run run LS and

597
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,669
pipe it to grab you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

598
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,199
right you know but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just like</font>

599
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,820
the hackers doing here is like they they

600
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,290
hacked anthem and then they piped it

601
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,389
over to turbotax<font color="#CCCCCC"> and monetize it and</font>

602
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,620
turn it into cash right that's really

603
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">what was happening it wasn't super</font>

604
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,179
complicated now let's turn back now to

605
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,580
this concept of threat intelligence and

606
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,110
how you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know at</font>

607
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,939
least the current paradigm to make

608
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,709
progress and detected pneus and then how

609
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,930
you could employ other paradigms so

610
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,750
here's the thing you know that was

611
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,790
spearfishing with the we'11 point calm

612
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,190
domain what's the significance of that

613
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,170
well well point was a company that

614
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,610
merged with anthem and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

615
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,770
changed the name anthem is the bigger

616
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,530
bigger company but they used to have a

617
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,750
domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> wellpoint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> com which was core to</font>

618
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the business functions of the medical</font>

619
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,690
company

620
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,520
so the attacker went ahead and purchased

621
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,170
a barian at that domain name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of</font>

622
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,420
course used it in social engineering

623
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,550
operations so you're left with that you

624
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">know overriding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question of well did</font>

625
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,080
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this domain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name was</font>

626
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,550
malicious at the time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when they</font>

627
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,840
were getting hacked right was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

628
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,770
the cyber threat intelligence feed and

629
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,050
could they have cross-reference that

630
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,330
successfully in their security logs to

631
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,100
concluded they were under threat no

632
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now there's people that</font>

633
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,889
will say well there's some some company

634
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,900
new out there but they had redacted it

635
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,400
in some other report what is that like

636
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,870
partial credit dude it doesn't help

637
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I don't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

638
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,469
knew somewhere else you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

639
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,720
fact is if you're there a security guy

640
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,370
responsible for protecting that part of

641
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,230
the network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have a strategy</font>

642
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,669
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on serendipity to</font>

643
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,900
get the job done right you have to you

644
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,460
have to do it yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to</font>

645
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,050
have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own discipline to figure out</font>

646
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,040
what's what's real and not real and

647
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,800
normal and not normal in your

648
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,370
environment and then you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

649
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the debruce be apt malware family</font>

650
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,750
was used<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know then there's been</font>

651
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,130
analysis done on those pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware</font>

652
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,560
and there's the you know yarra

653
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,090
signatures forum that's good all right

654
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,399
where those yard signatures available

655
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,429
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were pwned initially you know</font>

656
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,320
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anthem no we're not available right</font>

657
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the whole point right it's you're</font>

658
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,399
watching the news right you know if I'm

659
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,250
if I'm watching CNN and I say uh look

660
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,420
somebody's driving a chrysler town<font color="#CCCCCC"> &</font>

661
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,330
country down the street looks just like

662
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,010
mine right like that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a method to</font>

663
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,510
protect my car from being stolen right

664
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,520
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know my car was stolen and</font>

665
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the similar similarity of if you</font>

666
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,950
go through and just employee the stuff

667
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,780
you're not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leading indicator</font>

668
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,780
it's definitely a trailing indicator of

669
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:36,750
exploitation okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what the</font>

670
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:40,020
diagram looks like you have this mapping

671
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,110
between you know like HR solutions and

672
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,670
the VPN address and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to the real</font>

673
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">wellpoint domains that were used by the</font>

674
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,290
company for business so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it</font>

675
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,610
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a sort of a one-and-done</font>

676
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,110
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering endeavor right they</font>

677
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,449
actually went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took time to</font>

678
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to map critical systems</font>

679
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,240
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual systems that were used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

680
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">mission and then of course how would</font>

681
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,360
they you know architect the social

682
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,580
engineering op to grab creds and get in

683
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,389
behind the behind the the perimeter

684
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,629
defenses so one of my colleagues at a

685
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,990
dark trace had made this statement

686
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,190
back as it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in late 2014 and he's</font>

687
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like look you know the hackers have been</font>

688
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice people and he was saying</font>

689
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that about JP Morgan there was acts</font>

690
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,670
pretty good access inside JP Morgan<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

691
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,740
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do anything to speak</font>

692
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be a we're waiting to see</font>

693
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,040
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a fraud happened but but</font>

694
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,930
they could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more damage</font>

695
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,730
from to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial system if they had</font>

696
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">just been destructive and they didn't do</font>

697
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,270
that but we sort of thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

698
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,920
other shoes going to drop somewhere

699
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,379
someday around here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course</font>

700
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,910
in short succession afterward we did see

701
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,520
a more aggressive approach taken with

702
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,860
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony and this is the last screened</font>

703
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,150
a lot of Sony employees saw before they

704
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,360
ended up having their master boot record

705
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,760
deleted you know it was attributed to

706
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,110
the North Koreans by the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

707
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see you know but based on</font>

708
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that terrible art it must be the North</font>

709
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,780
Koreans I mean jeez look at that awful

710
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but but but the more but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

711
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story here is it's it's kind of like</font>

712
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,090
an example of real cyber terrorism if

713
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,130
you think about it right they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

714
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,500
cyber operation and attempted to

715
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,540
intimidate real world people and change

716
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">their real-world behavior right that's</font>

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition of political terrorism</font>

718
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and cyber terrorism because of using a</font>

719
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,120
cyber tactic so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an in my mind</font>

720
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,649
sort of the first real example of a

721
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,689
cyber terrorism attack with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose</font>

722
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,160
of influencing you know behavior and of

723
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the US government did</font>

724
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,760
recognize it as a something certainly

725
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,199
offensive but didn't necessarily but

726
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,440
left it in kind of an ambiguous state

727
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,510
with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of their response one of</font>

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that was said by the FBI in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the aftermath the Sony attack was oh</font>

730
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,640
this incident appears have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">conducted using techniques that went</font>

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
undetected by industry standard

733
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,430
antivirus I said to myself man I could

734
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,990
have like appeared on every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

735
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,170
to breach like as far back as the eye

736
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,460
can see and years right like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

737
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,080
there it's on the present you know

738
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
getting those getting those signature

739
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,929
updates and things like that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

740
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,100
going to be in a position that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

741
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a leading indicator in these</font>

742
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,629
scenarios and then the last you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

743
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,510
what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about here in</font>

744
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,100
terms of a recent case study is the the

745
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,540
OPM data breach I want you're looking at

746
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,399
on the left is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the letter I received</font>

747
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,050
right you know because i had a clearance

748
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,900
for for the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here it is</font>

749
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,830
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> James</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Penrose telling me that hey you</font>

750
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know all your information was</font>

751
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,860
compromised in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> major data breach and</font>

752
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,870
blah blah blah hey you want credit

753
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,740
security monitoring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help right</font>

754
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,520
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your family not really a lot</font>

755
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,720
of stuff was calm

756
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,430
my stand I'll get into that in a minute

757
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is</font>

758
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,930
the trust between OPM right the office

759
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,850
responsible for holding the clearance

760
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,190
data and the adjudication information

761
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,750
what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean well yeah they come to</font>

762
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,000
my neighbors and say you know Jim yeah

763
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,170
Jim he's okay you know he drinks a

764
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,370
little bit you know some time he gets

765
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,690
belligerent but most the time he's nice

766
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,459
you know that they write all that down

767
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,230
right and they and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they stick it into my</font>

768
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,420
file and they do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all electronically</font>

769
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,710
right and maybe you know OPM doesn't

770
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,330
have enough investigators to do all that

771
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">right because there's an awful lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

772
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">people with clearances in America so</font>

773
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,930
what do they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> subcontracted out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

774
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,189
the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire a contractor and for</font>

775
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,870
the contractor to enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same</font>

776
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,280
information what do they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now</font>

777
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,139
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have VPN credentials they</font>

778
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,200
got have access to the portal you can be

779
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,270
able to file that stuff right so the

780
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,740
attacker says you know the walls kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

781
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">high over there at OPM and they're kind</font>

782
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,140
of like wise to the fact that they're a

783
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,240
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they held all the</font>

784
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,770
security clearances why don't we go pop

785
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">key point government solutions instead</font>

786
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,820
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off in</font>

787
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,590
Colorado or someplace far away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

788
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,389
mean who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know little me</font>

789
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,939
in Colorado I'm just a subcontractor for

790
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,340
the OPM right so they get compromised

791
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,930
and and credentials are stolen right

792
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,870
from those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that work and</font>

793
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,760
the attacker rides back into OPM systems

794
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,929
of course surveys you know what do I

795
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,690
have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with these credentials</font>

796
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,640
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually you know goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

797
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,500
that process<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had on the basic bag of</font>

798
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,750
tricks slide you know figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

799
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,740
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to by enumeration</font>

800
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,810
exploiting some other machines and then

801
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,000
laying down back doors and making a

802
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:56,750
sustained path to exfiltrate data out of

803
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,250
the network and you'll hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

804
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,450
man<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just used encryption</font>

805
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,090
and encryption encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

806
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,860
have been the key yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> masquerade</font>

807
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,169
operations right remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> when someone</font>

808
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,669
uses valid credentials right the mission

809
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,350
system decrypts the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows it to</font>

810
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,690
them right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have</font>

811
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">authorization to see it so so you know</font>

812
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,720
don't when you think of in terms of

813
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,209
encryption you really have to think of

814
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole you know sort of cryptography</font>

815
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,290
and security argument about you know

816
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,580
authenticity and non-repudiation and all

817
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,440
the other stuff not just confidentiality

818
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,260
right showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody a blob of</font>

819
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,210
ciphertext<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great you know but but</font>

820
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,020
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the size of</font>

821
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,340
the game right if they've got

822
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,590
credentials that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

823
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,939
and

824
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,418
going up in the portal and give them

825
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,250
full access so and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

826
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with these Chinese believed to</font>

827
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,720
be Chinese state-sponsored attackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

828
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,639
you know it it causes a huge threat

829
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">right this is a threat that's far</font>

830
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,200
reaching beyond cyber right now think of

831
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,120
this in real terms right they know you

832
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">know every every foreign associate I've</font>

833
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,418
ever had<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd had to report all that they</font>

834
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,470
know all my email accounts and

835
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,390
everything else because I had to report

836
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,429
that now too they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my</font>

837
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,220
fingerprints right down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that level of</font>

838
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">information you know 32 up to 32 million</font>

839
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,720
people in America who have top security

840
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,429
clearances she's just imagine trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

841
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,289
cross a border right if you were on a

842
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,570
sensitive mission right with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

843
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:14,610
of data being compromised right you

844
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,830
gonna issue new fingers or fingerprints

845
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,209
get your 3d printer going i mean i don't

846
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,658
know maybe maybe it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but</font>

847
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,860
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an awful lot of</font>

848
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,970
ridiculousness right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

849
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,029
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your business and cyber</font>

850
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,320
right and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to to see</font>

851
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:31,260
these kinds of intrusions you're not

852
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,059
going to take a you know 122 page form

853
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,320
you know 32<font color="#E5E5E5"> million of those plus</font>

854
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,720
fingerprints you're not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

855
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,250
you know low and<font color="#CCCCCC"> slow that data out of</font>

856
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,630
the network right you know as people

857
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,450
like to say well what if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was low and</font>

858
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,740
slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it would have taken you 150</font>

859
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,899
years to get all that data out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it was</font>

860
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,940
low and slow right this is terabytes of

861
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,830
data sucked out it obviously happened

862
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">more quickly should have been noticed by</font>

863
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:56,760
someone somewhere but wasn't okay and

864
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:59,969
then I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a little detour</font>

865
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,860
now into dragonfly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> energetic bear so</font>

866
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,809
I talked a lot about the enterprise the

867
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,129
corporate IT<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise IT environment</font>

868
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,990
now what I'm going to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch</font>

869
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,020
contexts and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about industrial</font>

870
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,399
control systems so what I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

871
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here with the industrial control</font>

872
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,360
systems is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the approach that was</font>

873
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:18,570
taken presumably by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russians in this</font>

874
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,309
case to to compromise you know energy

875
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and to gain you know sustained</font>

876
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:25,200
access moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they realized</font>

877
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,850
again that you know the enclaves that

878
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,159
are set up to protect industrial control

879
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,689
systems networks skater networks from

880
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,010
the enterprise IT network are usually

881
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,809
pretty substantial right there's an

882
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,250
attempted air gapping still and where

883
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:36,779
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have air gaps right what you</font>

884
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,789
have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> enclave controllers that are</font>

885
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do one way transfers and blah</font>

886
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:42,059
blah blah there's a huge you know

887
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,610
discipline around that right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

888
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,049
trying to Matt

889
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,279
but so they realized you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

890
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of hard to hack your way in from</font>

891
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the outside in those scenarios so they</font>

892
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,389
got smart and what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they said</font>

893
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">well let's go after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those industrial</font>

894
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:54,840
control system companies because the

895
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,029
companies you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they have to provide</font>

896
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,340
updates to their different systems that

897
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:01,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">they use right so what they did is they</font>

898
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,970
went ahead and and and popped the

899
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and posted on the company's</font>

900
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,749
web sites you know the updates right

901
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,110
that would be up download and brought in

902
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:11,730
and then you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this rat</font>

903
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,678
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Havok's there was just a</font>

904
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,850
string<font color="#CCCCCC"> Havoc's in the code that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was you</font>

905
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see to reverse engineering of the</font>

906
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,899
rat that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called headaches and</font>

907
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:20,609
and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kept modifying that</font>

908
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:23,070
to their purposes and so they could do

909
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:26,009
their their enumeration and possibly run

910
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,178
code inside so i could dragonfly of dumb

911
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:29,700
federal throw that out there is a

912
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:31,830
concept in a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then is there</font>

913
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,859
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else like it out there right</font>

914
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,908
now undetected just underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> the radar</font>

915
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,918
maybe it's persisting out there and it's

916
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:40,080
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay out there for a while okay</font>

917
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,789
so what did it look like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

918
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,499
world this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it looked like you</font>

919
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,149
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the these are the websites</font>

920
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:47,460
from the real ICS providers and it's

921
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:49,559
like these download links had not only

922
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the real software to update the ICS</font>

923
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,178
system but also had the malware attached

924
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,639
to it that was the malicious malicious

925
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,190
software that would give the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Havoc's you</font>

926
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:00,479
know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run inside the network and</font>

927
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,789
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do its enumeration things</font>

928
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,399
like that so they obviously went to a

929
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:07,230
lot of trouble right to hack these ICS

930
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,840
companies to get this level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

931
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web server and to to attach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

932
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,459
malware to those update binaries now

933
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,690
again keep them<font color="#CCCCCC"> back here at could they</font>

934
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,549
have done better than this right you

935
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,720
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a hey let's just</font>

936
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,279
jam these two things together throw it

937
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,289
up on the website run up the flagpole

938
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:24,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody salutes were set right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

939
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,509
was kind of like the I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

940
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if this tactic works</font>

941
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:32,070
what could they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan to</font>

942
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,408
have extrusion well the havoc<font color="#E5E5E5"> stro Djem</font>

943
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,639
was able to you know scan once it got on

944
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,619
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look for these protocols</font>

945
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:40,289
that are unique to SCADA and industrial

946
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:42,359
control systems rslinx and Modbus and

947
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,879
siemens plc and sip and a bunch of other

948
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,809
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this allows them to detect</font>

949
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:50,519
the presence of those actual big big

950
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,590
industrial pieces of equipment whether

951
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,119
they be generators turbines you name it

952
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,550
all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we use to keep the</font>

953
00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:00,240
lights<font color="#CCCCCC"> on or run a steel mill or you</font>

954
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:02,100
make cars all that stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is run</font>

955
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,600
by these different protocols so when

956
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,889
it's out there scanning and enumerated

957
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,290
it's going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify those</font>

958
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,460
different pieces of equipment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

959
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,500
out there on the network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can talk</font>

960
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,880
to and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last part</font>

961
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,470
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I think the most you</font>

962
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,150
know sinister part is this bottom has

963
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,920
the ability to run programs and scripts

964
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,680
on the attackers command arbitrary

965
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,880
programs and scripts so when I work for

966
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Department of Defense we always had</font>

967
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,760
this or pithy little saying you know

968
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,730
computer network attack is a click away

969
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,530
or CNA is a click away right why is that

970
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,660
why do we use to say that well this is

971
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,180
exactly why once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have malware and</font>

972
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,710
you're out there in a network if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

973
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,840
run arbitrary code you can be

974
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,300
destructive right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally just a</font>

975
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,429
matter of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> task that's given</font>

976
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,409
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> command and control and this is</font>

977
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,150
this is exactly the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you don't</font>

978
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to let this kind of an adversary</font>

979
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,690
persist in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network because you know</font>

980
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,850
on that rainy day when they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

981
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,570
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this is the tactic that</font>

982
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:56,879
would be employed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so how did they</font>

983
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,740
do command and control with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Havoc's well</font>

984
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,300
they went and they didn't just you know

985
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,310
go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to godaddy and buy some brand new</font>

986
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,200
domain for the occasion they went out

987
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,310
and used sites that already had bill

988
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,290
purposes and already had their own

989
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,790
history this particular website was a

990
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,909
real website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this from the Wayback</font>

991
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:13,320
Machine from when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Havoc's was using it</font>

992
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,490
for operational command and control so

993
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,020
if you went there and asked it you know

994
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,730
for a web page it will give you the real

995
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,170
web page and you could do whatever the

996
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,680
person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs that site wanted to do</font>

997
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,910
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell drugs but if you send it</font>

998
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,380
certain you<font color="#CCCCCC"> our eyes and different</font>

999
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,970
strings well guess what it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1000
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,680
you back have<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command control instead</font>

1001
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,870
remarried it would give instructions and

1002
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,760
task out the Trojan to do different

1003
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,169
stuff right so you could see that's a

1004
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,510
pretty you know advanced tactic of

1005
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,370
leaving it sort of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this state where</font>

1006
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,870
the real users and the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of</font>

1007
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the website is intact and it still has</font>

1008
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,860
credibility but then it's also being

1009
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,140
abused in that way maliciously so it's

1010
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as easy to say you know thumbs up or</font>

1011
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,200
thumbs down on whether it's good or bad

1012
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,570
it's sometimes it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray state</font>

1013
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,660
in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really tell</font>

1014
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:57,750
and then Trend Micro finds in the wild

1015
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,920
with this updated version of have<font color="#E5E5E5"> X now</font>

1016
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,990
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-signed</font>

1018
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,390
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here is they jammed in IBM</font>

1019
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,590
as the issuer here they'll just like

1020
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,240
type that in and you know hopefully

1021
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,419
people will just go in at it and say

1022
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,400
okay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is real but you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1023
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,510
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're you don't you</font>

1024
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,100
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1025
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,750
right because it doesn't really pass the

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sniff test from a from a certificate</font>

1027

validation look at the strategy the

1028
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,020
adversaries employing right remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1029
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,330
question could<font color="#E5E5E5"> they be there right now</font>

1030
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,340
could they<font color="#E5E5E5"> be under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the under the radar</font>

1031
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:31,679
well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer has to be</font>

1032
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,209
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know tactics wise</font>

1033
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that they've went after the</font>

1034
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that they're</font>

1035
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,780
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign certificates in a certain</font>

1036
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,190
way right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be surreptitious is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1037
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,389
reasonable to assume that they've

1038
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,820
endeavored to get the signing

1039
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,770
certificates to those ICS companies we

1040
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,600
know they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get inside right I've</font>

1041
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,950
already shown you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right so they</font>

1042
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,280
have the signing certificate and their

1043
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,780
proper and they're able to to sign

1044
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,760
software maybe they can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1045
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,910
have a two-stage loader or something put

1046
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,920
into a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> software update man that is</font>

1047
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,510
hard to ferret out now because they're

1048
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be even lower and slower and</font>

1049
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:09,000
further under the radar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font>

1050
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,800
you know having technology technologists

1051
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,690
and operators walk in these updates on

1052

purpose across<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enclave boundaries and</font>

1053
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,470
things like that it only makes it worse

1054
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,750
when it when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the</font>

1055
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">approach the attackers taking at the</font>

1056
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,800
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you can see a command and</font>

1057
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:25,500
control post format right this is plain

1058
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,940
text HTTP great right easy to signature

1059
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,040
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably write signature right</font>

1060
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,080
now for that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only problem is just</font>

1061
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,000
one little flip of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know HTTPS</font>

1062
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,920
bit there and now they're going SSL<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1063
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,050
you're in an SSL inspection regime issue

1064
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,400
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to deal with that so it's</font>

1065
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,890
easy for them to just make some

1066
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,920
improvements and really fly under the

1067
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,210
radar<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now let us take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1068
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,500
of a step back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about a lot of</font>

1069
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">case studies I think you sort of get the</font>

1070
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,820
point of why the current paradigm is

1071
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,800
having you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues in terms of</font>

1072
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,810
detecting these threats before we have a

1073
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,160
crisis<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our hands so what I'm going to</font>

1074
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,080
do now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about little higher level</font>

1075
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,700
so the cybercriminal right look time is

1076
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,290
on their side they're completely brazen

1077
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,790
in tenacious they don't care right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1078
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,009
you catch a cybercriminal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint</font>

1079
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,300
AV do they get all glum and embarrassed

1080
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go away and slink away because</font>

1081
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they feel stupid they don't care</font>

1082
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try again right try try</font>

1083
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,490
again they're completely tenacious<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1084
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,080
that in that way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1085
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,540
everybody's looking to just exploit

1086
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,100
human weakness and frailty that's that's

1087
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,020
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> humans</font>

1088
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the problem you can't train your way</font>

1089
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,060
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the situation</font>

1090
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,650
right the humans are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

1091
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,360
try to get their job done and while they

1092
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,500
endeavor to do that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

1093
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,600
up getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves hacked and give a</font>

1094
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,170
beachhead to the adversary and at the

1095
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,640
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you know a lot of times those</font>

1096
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,800
credentials that gets stolen authorized

1097
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,569
access right blend up looking like an

1098
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,700
insider threat in those scenarios and

1099
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,680
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an insider</font>

1100
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,910
program on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of security it's got</font>

1101
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,919
to be integrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you have to think</font>

1102
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the in the insider program in the</font>

1103
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,680
same way you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your security</font>

1104
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">cyber security efforts cyber</font>

1105
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,279
intelligence efforts because a lot of

1106
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,540
times those insiders just like a key

1107
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,980
point government solutions right when

1108
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,450
those big masquerades were happening and

1109
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,060
they were sucking data out you know with

1110
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,560
authorized credentials yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looked</font>

1111
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,610
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an insider right abusing privilege</font>

1112
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,470
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day it was an</font>

1113
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,260
outsider you know who's who had set up a

1114
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:10,290
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> path of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X filtration now</font>

1115
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,480
finally what does makes an apt advanced

1116
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,790
look apts have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money big</font>

1117
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,290
resources they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

1118
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,720
laboratory look at what the best

1119
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,520
practices are bringing those pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1120
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,259
equipment and test them right why do

1121
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,030
they do that right well they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1122
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,010
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right and see if they can</font>

1123
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,050
maneuver around your IPS right oh great

1124
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,000
I've used my tactics and now the IPS is

1125
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,500
no longer going off right then they come

1126
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,120
inside and say oh I got caught by

1127
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,590
endpoint AV well let me just rework or

1128
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,330
this or obfuscated polymorphic malware

1129
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,550
or whatever right now I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1130
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,140
endpoint AV right so now they realized

1131
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,310
oh well if I use these different tactics

1132
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,960
right I can mover to the right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font>

1133
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,549
and and now I'm clear and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1134
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trip off what would be the best</font>

1135
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,330
practices security stack when it come in

1136
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,710
and then they also you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give a</font>

1137
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,940
nod<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to their experts that they</font>

1138
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,590
might be able to take a known

1139
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,850
vulnerability and implement an exploit

1140
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,170
against it even though nobody else has

1141
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,370
seen an exploit in the wild and they may

1142
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,960
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep that under their hat as</font>

1143
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,580
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-day but you know let's let's</font>

1144
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,560
leave that out there as a possibility

1145
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the biggest threat</font>

1146
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,040
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this regard the paradigm that I'm</font>

1147
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about is literally this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> testing</font>

1148
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,710
paradigm right they set up the lab and

1149
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they test it and that's why they get</font>

1150
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,950
around you right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they know and</font>

1151
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,120
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's the last step after</font>

1152
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,669
they've figured out how to get around

1153
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,990
the products will they take your

1154
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,490
favorite cyber threat intelligence speed

1155
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,540
and they cross reference there the IPS

1156
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,830
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and the domain</font>

1157
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,080
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the emails and everything else</font>

1158
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,670
right well why<font color="#CCCCCC"> do they do that right</font>

1159
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,590
because they're not stupid right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

1160
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody knows the tactics and that</font>

1161
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,710
we're employing right it's we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

1162
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">it at conferences constantly and and</font>

1163
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,550
we're going to optimize that process but

1164
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,860
the adversary knows that and they can

1165
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,570
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do blind tests on it right so</font>

1166
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,520
the fact that they can blindly test

1167
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,840
your paradigm is the reason they're

1168
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,090
always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around you right</font>

1169
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,050
that that's the fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that</font>

1170
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,820
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop them with the</font>

1171
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,050
current paradigm in spite of all

1172
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,370
optimization so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have</font>

1173
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,290
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're not going to have</font>

1174
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,000
in their lab right it's the way your

1175
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,230
people behave it's the way they use

1176
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,610
computers and devices in your network

1177
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,500
right so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a minute</font>

1178
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,350
right you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got people using android</font>

1179
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,420
tablets and iPads and multifunction

1180
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,009
device printer scanner copier all those

1181
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,200
things the way they use the sharepoint

1182
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,610
and and your mission apps the way

1183
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,700
they're behaving is something that is

1184
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:14,430
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really susceptible to importation</font>

1185
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,230
into this lab to test right think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1186
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,970
it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> intractable right so you say if</font>

1187
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,680
you you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your gigamon</font>

1188
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,080
monitoring fabric for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

1189
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,109
you say I've got a 10 gigabit per second

1190
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,490
you know monitoring poured you know that

1191
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,720
I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my environment that</font>

1192
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,209
represents all the stuff i just

1193
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,799
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um that's a lot of</font>

1194
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,300
data you know think about that for a

1195
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,150
minute that's a lot of data is it

1196
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,830
tractable for these guys to bring all

1197
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,390
that data into their lab and test

1198
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,920
against it and figure out well well

1199
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,180
here's how we normally behave<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

1200
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,980
that I know how you normally behave I

1201
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,140
can behave this way it moved that way a

1202
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,550
bit over around you not really right

1203
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,400
it's not really tractable for them to do

1204
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,990
that it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the concept of good</font>

1205
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,670
encryption right i mean we could have a

1206
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,169
discussion about an encryption algorithm

1207
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,400
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it and master the</font>

1208
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,800
encryption algorithm you know hey this

1209
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,690
is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes works that's great Jim I</font>

1210
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,480
understand how tes works then I show you

1211
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,620
a cipher<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher text or crypto grab that</font>

1212
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,590
you don't know this symmetric key for

1213
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,089
and you say I can't brute<font color="#E5E5E5"> force attack</font>

1214
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,400
that come up with this with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1215
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,410
plain texts right yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because</font>

1216
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,480
it's intractable right this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1217
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do to break the the Abbess aires</font>

1218
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,590
tactics here right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

1219
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,990
systems and technology right in the

1220
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,820
cyber security technological arms raised

1221
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,020
here that takes advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your your</font>

1222
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">own uniqueness right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you</font>

1223
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,630
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take advantage of your own</font>

1224
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,669
uniqueness you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fall</font>

1225
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,140
victim to the same old paradigm they

1226
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,370
have lather rinse repeat they just do

1227
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over again and</font>

1228
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,650
then we're surprised at the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1229
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">right it's a definition of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> insanity</font>

1230
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,590
right we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there from</font>

1231
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,480
here you have to bring something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new to</font>

1232
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,130
the fight then you of course have to put

1233
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,570
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new thing right so to</font>

1234
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,710
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at look at what's coming out and</font>

1235
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">act on so again I've already said this</font>

1236
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,140
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're what we're doing right now</font>

1237
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the current paradigm is we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1238
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,410
a matching action

1239
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,000
sighs like you're in elementary school

1240
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,230
well if I knew yesterday what I knew

1241
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,060
today would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have detected it well that's</font>

1242
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,620
the excuse I assigned to the logic bomb

1243
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,700
right I had all the tools but I didn't

1244
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,630
have them configured properly well

1245
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,430
that's what I assigned to the data

1246
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,390
breach you know I had all the events and

1247
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,859
alerts I just didn't know which ones

1248
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,480
mattered right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how you know we</font>

1249
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,590
had the insider attack and then you go

1250
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">through matching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know and</font>

1251
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,850
that's what you tell your bosses right

1252
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,320
when something happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't get</font>

1253
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,970
around it by just<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimizing the eighty</font>

1254
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,410
percent solution okay it could be

1255
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,779
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your eighty percent solution</font>

1256
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:20,930
execute your program flawlessly and

1257
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:23,570
still fail okay because it's not

1258
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,779
intelligence right you've you've

1259
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,670
constructed a mechanism to watch cyber

1260
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,680
news and then respond to cyber news

1261
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,940
right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you have to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1262
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,190
discipline of intelligence to take

on the unknowns about the uniqueness and

1265
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,480
the difference of what's happening in

<font color="#E5E5E5">your network every day so how do you</font>

like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> described well you have to</font>

1269
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,290
get those timely indications of warning

1270
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,760
before a crisis right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't wait for</font>

1271
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,080
somebody else to get hacked and a big

1272
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,310
data breach to a car and then six months

1273
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,350
later it show up in your cyber threat

1274
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,430
intelligence speed right we know that's

1275
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a day late and a dollar</font>

1276
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,270
short understand the tradecraft of the

1277
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,210
adversaries you have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in assuming</font>

1278
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,350
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use clean</font>

1279
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,820
infrastructure addresses IP addresses

1280
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,250
domain names things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font>

1281
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,320
assume they've tested your eyesight feet

1282
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,610
and made sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not in there</font>

1283
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,500
great now I can run the attack right

1284
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,300
there assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1285
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,730
obfuscate their malware to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1286
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,190
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you past endpoint and sandboxing</font>

1287
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,930
defenses and then finally the insider

1288
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,110
threat behaviors that you see you know

1289
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,669
abusing authorized access may very well

1290
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,260
be an external attack or two right could

1291
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">be illegitimate insider right who's</font>

1292
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,740
really it inside a threat but it could

1293
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,060
also be an external attacker who's

1294
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,500
gotten its you know spirited their way

1295
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,920
into the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and are using those</font>

1296
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,080
authorized creds so I know our natural

1297
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,270
instincts are to say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ain't so right</font>

1298
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,920
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work in one of these op centers</font>

1299
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,330
or you're in charge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> security right</font>

1300
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,820
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see an insider doing something</font>

1301
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:49,460
weird you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to believe it right</font>

1302
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a discipline right you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1303
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,580
you have to investigate these things you

1304
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,410
have to have a means to prioritize

1305
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,390
what's weird what you work on and why

1306
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:59,390
and you have to you have to bring

1307
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:02,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself force yourself to spend time on</font>

1308
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,029
it right because the pile of bad is very

1309
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,529
big right and

1310
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,940
work on the pile of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad all day long and</font>

1311
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">then maybe you've got 20 minutes at the</font>

1312
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day after the pile of bad</font>

1313
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero to go look at weird the weird is</font>

1314
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:15,899
what's going to get you right so if it's

1315
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,130
bad you have to automate to the extent

1316
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,470
practical right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

1317
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:21,420
capacity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wetware of your smart</font>

1318
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,830
people to go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at weird because weird</font>

1319
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,020
is going to be where the targeted

1320
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:28,080
attacks come from the apts and and those

1321
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,910
unique approaches you have to create a

1322
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,160
security stack that's contextually aware

1323
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,509
what do I mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's what I just</font>

1324
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,549
said about your own uniqueness right you

1325
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,960
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to develop a pattern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1326
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,880
life right for the white people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1327
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">behaving in the network just like your</font>

1328
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,940
human body right can distinguish between

1329
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,490
what's good and bad right I can shake

1330
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,870
your hands here and if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get sick it's</font>

1331
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,310
like not a false negative right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1332
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,990
a terminal then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't die tomorrow</font>

1333
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:51,090
right I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get a sniffle and we move</font>

1334
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,220
on right you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the same</font>

1335
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,870
resilient mindset when it comes to cyber

1336
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,640
intelligence you have to implement that

1337
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,930
advanced threat detection right anomaly

1338
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,359
detection that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

1339
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things to start from right to</font>

1340
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,270
scratch to start your investigation from

1341
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,550
you have to be able to prioritize weird

1342
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,530
right it's a big stack of weird right

1343
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,000
where do I start do I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of pick</font>

1344
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,590
up couch pillows and look for change

1345
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,120
right it's not that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1346
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,860
technique that's not a good technique

1347
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,680
right to figure out where to do your

1348
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,970
hunting in the pile of weird you have to

1349
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,830
devote substantial resources to

1350
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,209
anomalies in your enterprise I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1351
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,970
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily have a staff</font>

1352
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,350
that big right understood right but but

1353
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,390
but realize that maybe you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1354
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,279
retain help or somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in a</font>

1355
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,810
contract that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought in to do</font>

1356
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,760
kind of hunting activities or at least

1357
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,560
running an overwatch position for the

1358
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,210
anomalies in your network and be able to

1359
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide you some leads on a regular</font>

1360
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,870
basis to say what why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

1361
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,220
this take a second look over here right

1362
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not normal I</font>

1363
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,330
don't know it's malicious but I know

1364
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,620
it's not normal right that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1365
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:50,100
bump in the night that you have to go

1366
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,900
look out look at and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1367
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,370
have to hunt when you get this as an

1368
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,230
indication right going out and just

1369
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,819
reimaging a computer something we're

1370
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here just going to reimage it</font>

1371
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,390
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let's just get that</font>

1372
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,620
thing clean really is that going to

1373
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">clean it out do you think you got all</font>

1374
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,160
the tendrils of an advanced attacker

1375
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,960
right the guys that run the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Havoc's you</font>

1376
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,480
know energetic bear operations you think

1377
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,610
reimaging one box keeps them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out now</font>

1378
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,070
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have hunters you have</font>

1379
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,490
to have people who are experienced in

1380
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,960
investigating the tendrils of that

1381
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,100
of activity and again if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1382
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,869
the staff you're not going to be able to

1383
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:24,430
develop that work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who can</font>

1384
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:25,960
and use them in that regard so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1385
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,910
leave you with one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sort of</font>

1386
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">final thought on this you know the Blue</font>

1387
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,810
Jays did to really you know they've had

1388
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,070
a good year right I camera did they win

1389
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,049
or lose last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night I had to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sleep</font>

1390
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:39,520
because I got in<font color="#CCCCCC"> at like 3am they win or</font>

1391
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:41,080
lose good they won fantastic so if you

1392
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about a baseball analogy in this</font>

1393
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,640
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cyber brazilians you know you</font>

1394
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,110
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out and ask the pitcher</font>

1395
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,230
to throw a perfect game every night as

1396
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,310
the coach to win a baseball game right

1397
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,680
you just need to keep the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

1398
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,600
from scoring runs now there's a little

1399
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of a bend not break model built into</font>

1400
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,440
baseball okay think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

1401
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can walk a guy and you can get on</font>

1402
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,619
first base somebody can hit a signal and

1403
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that guy might go to third you know you</font>

1404
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:05,890
got first and third the other team

1405
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,930
hasn't scored a run yet right and as

1406
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,600
long as your defense is good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1407
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,368
keep to straddle runners on the bases

1408
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,470
you could still win in this world okay

1409
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:15,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could still win and you can still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1410
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,939
ahead of it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an intelligence</font>

1411
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:21,310
perspective and be able to avoid

1412
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,869
becoming you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person in the news</font>

1413
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,220
that becomes a highlight right for

1414
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else like me to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about later</font>

1415
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,970
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1416
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,040
give you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of sort of sort</font>

1417
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:31,270
of the call you know to action on here

1418
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,340
when it comes to the cyber cyber

1419
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,720
intelligence as a discipline is think of

1420
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they give yourselves in a resilient</font>

1421
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,009
way right you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see every</font>

1422
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:41,200
initial exploit you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1423
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,390
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's too many ways and new</font>

1424
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,980
novel things that could be done but at

1425
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,779
the end of the day an adversary has to

1426
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,060
have command and control right they have

1427
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,430
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strive and get to a key</font>

1428
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,590
resource or to a key person key level of

1429
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,029
access and Rome is never built in a day

1430
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,609
right they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done with</font>

1431
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,440
it right with just one exploit one and

1432
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">done on one guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or work on one gal right</font>

1433
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,119
so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you build a mechanism</font>

1434
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,550
right to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see where to start</font>

1435
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,680
where to go next you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to to be</font>

1436
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,570
resilient and figure out those threats

1437
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,490
early enough in the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

1438
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,619
hasn't become a crisis and straighten

1439
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,240
those runners on base right so so that's

1440
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,820
that's what we need to do and to

1441
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,618
discover novel cyber threats you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1442
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,170
have a focus in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> regard and of</font>

1443
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:24,220
course put people against it and you

1444
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">know whether it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian military</font>

1445
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,799
or intelligence services or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1446
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,360
know military intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

1447
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,880
we've got an awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of veterans who</font>

1448
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,260
really understand cyber write really

1449
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,370
well they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> operational</font>

1450
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,720
practitioners and they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

1451
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,609
degrees from the biggest name schools

1452
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">they might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been enlisted or senior</font>

1453
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:43,770
enlisted folks give them a chance think

1454
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about them and consider them as Joey</font>

1455
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,250
your team because they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the ones</font>

1456
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your secret sauce to get into</font>

1457
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,040
this space because they had to live it

1458
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,960
right they had to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence in the</font>

1459
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,580
real world right and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

1460
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,470
their lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> depended on it right so if</font>

1461
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,840
you turn to them for advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and help in</font>

1462
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you're going to end up hiring some</font>

1463
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,510
really great people so I'll stop there

1464
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,510
for questions

1465
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,960
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was what about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honey</font>

1466
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,610
potting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a strategy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help divert</font>

1467
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,010
attackers and learn about their tactics

1468
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,860
and techniques um yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1469
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,450
people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that employed as a strategy</font>

1470
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,760
to get some indications as to who's

1471
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,980
after them and why I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a honey</font>

1472
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,780
potting perspective you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you want to</font>

1473
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,370
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think comprehensively about</font>

1474
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,380
a honeypot right so instead of just

1475
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,910
saying i'm going to leave i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1476
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave a window ajar over here on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1477
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,210
side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see who you know finds their</font>

1478
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,069
way in that window right from an outside

1479
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,720
in scanning perspective like you know

1480
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:58,060
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get past my firewall and they</font>

1481
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,069
they found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a vulnerable</font>

1482
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,570
version of some PHP on a web server

1483
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,890
that's that's internet-facing right you

1484
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,360
know that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like a honey</font>

1485
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,870
pot you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be discovered that</font>

1486
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:10,480
way by an external attacker but in

1487
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,740
reality right and maybe maybe people do

1488
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,140
run their honey pots this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I'm just</font>

1489
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,689
not super aware of it is that you know

1490
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,420
you're good you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to like take</font>

1491
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,740
those spear phishing messages and all

1492
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that's really the targeted</font>

1493
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,560
social engineering attacks and if you're

1494
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run good honey pots right you</font>

1495
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,410
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute some of</font>

1496
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,970
those on purpose right and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1497
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,009
cloister environment to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

1498
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:33,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to where they go from there right now if</font>

1499
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,110
you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a walled garden you</font>

1500
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:38,200
don't let go anywhere what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1501
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen is you know the attacker may get</font>

1502
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,680
wise to you right you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of end up in</font>

1503
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,089
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs. by kind of</font>

1504
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,799
counterintelligence situation where they

1505
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,450
might sort of mislead you in a certain

1506
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">way about their tactic so if they can't</font>

1507
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,460
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize they can never really</font>

1508
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,589
get anywhere and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font>

1509
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">any pot right especially if you do a lot</font>

1510
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of virtualization for the honeypot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1511
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,540
know that's that may be very well

1512
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,070
figured out by an adversary right so so

1513
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,480
just bear that in mind right i mean i

1514
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:02,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the honey pots are going to be</font>

1515
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,300
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful against i would say low to</font>

1516
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:06,040
mid<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier attackers right when you get up</font>

1517
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,170
to the upper echelons right you could

1518
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,120
get deceived and thrown off by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1519
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,610
sophisticated actor who's purposely kind

1520
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,109
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding you misinformation it through</font>

1521
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:16,110
it with your honey pot so so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lads</font>

1522
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,240
good

1523
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,700
absolutely so that's a great that's a

1524
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,720
great example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another approach that</font>

1525
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,120
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

1526
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,819
engineering aspects of using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot</font>

1527
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,740
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about having a fake</font>

1528
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,570
executive and a fake you know executive

1529
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,279
assistant is you know how do you

1530
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,480
distinguish between you know them and

1531
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,500
the real you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know if it's</font>

1532
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,030
somebody you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up on the web</font>

1533
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,070
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a common tactic is you</font>

1534
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,870
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's faith you know</font>

1535
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">linkedin intelligence or whatever right</font>

1536
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,500
you know an attacker will go look to see

1537
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,480
who's the person in charge or highly

1538
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,650
connected individual in your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1539
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,700
then they'll target them that way right

1540
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,230
they'll figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's connected and</font>

1541
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,779
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you and that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that respect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1542
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,790
you know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to create and</font>

1543
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,440
maintain fake personas are they going to

1544
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,060
be you know other accounts assigned to

1545
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,410
real people write that are the ones that

1546
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,910
are just used for honey potting those

1547
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:11,509
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all tactics you can talk about but</font>

1548
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,980
it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real</font>

1549
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,330
users right like say say you have some

1550
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,830
honey pot accounts associated with an

1551
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,440
executive right maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1552
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,540
security executive right they're going

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be you know they've got these</font>

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,540
alternative personas and personalities

1555
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,710
that you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in that</font>

1556
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">case right and how you're going to</font>

1557
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,860
manage the alternative personas and

1558
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,500
personalities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep it straight for</font>

1559
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,150
honey pot purposes so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a it</font>

1560
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:41,880
becomes complex is what I'm trying to

1561
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:43,860
say yep absolutely yeah I mean so you

1562
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a plug for dark trace right you can</font>

1563
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,770
come look at us on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor right</font>

1564
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:48,270
that's one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we are</font>

1565
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,830
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right machine learning on</font>

1566
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,790
supervised machine learning figures out

1567
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,140
your uniqueness tells you what's

1568
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,390
different right so come down and see us

1569
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,670
there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people that do</font>

1570
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,200
it too the question is who's the best at

1571
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and why you know how do you</font>

1572
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,250
prioritize the stack of weird

1573
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:12,729
I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important thing</font>

1574
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have what would be</font>

1575
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:15,968
considered an advanced threat detection

1576
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:17,348
capability is what it comes down to

1577
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:18,969
right so anything that fits into that

1578
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,249
category of advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat detection</font>

1579
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:23,249
you know those might be appliances those

1580
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:25,839
might be you know big data analytics

1581
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:27,339
capabilities you know there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1582
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,929
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who say hey I can</font>

1583
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:31,209
figure out what weird is right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I can</font>

1584
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:33,400
prioritize what weird is now think about

1585
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:35,319
the distinction between things that are

1586
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,779
run in a batch mode like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud job</font>

1587
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:39,640
overnight as an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> right that might</font>

1588
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:41,380
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to to figure out what's weird</font>

1589
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,729
and concentrate on it but the problem

1590
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,859
you run into then is what if the cloud

1591
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:47,468
job crashes what if you what if you've

1592
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:49,058
got problems with data being adulterated

1593
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:50,079
right that's coming in from logs right

1594
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:51,729
you know what if somebody cleaned up the

1595
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,469
logs right and then you processed it on

1596
00:51:51,729 --> 00:51:55,328
the logs and missed a correlation right

1597
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:56,920
so when you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at tools that do</font>

1598
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:58,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just consider that and bear that in</font>

1599
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,410
mind right is you know am I in a

1600
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:00,849
situation where i could have a garbage

1601
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,499
in garbage out scenario right somebody

1602
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:08,130
had cleaned up a log and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I didn't</font>

1603
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:08,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see it okay thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
