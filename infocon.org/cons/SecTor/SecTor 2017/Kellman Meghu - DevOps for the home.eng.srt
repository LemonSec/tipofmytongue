36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,690
submitted and eventually was accepted to

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,909
speak at RSA for it although they had to

38
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the title</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and remember the fun</font>

slide where my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave her thoughts in</font>

41
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,020
security policy by the way was this they

42
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,390
made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out that slide so wasn't</font>

43
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,679
nearly as fun but I bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back</font>

44
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,270
because just in case you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it</font>

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,369
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one more thing that</font>

happened after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw that presentation</font>

47
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,790
because I at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I gave a list</font>

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,590
of like look if you need to protect

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,869
yourself in your home you're going to

50
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,119

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,260

55
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,650
list but let me explain what happened

56
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,820
I'm any gamers in the room anybody here

57
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,640

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,379
called evolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fully confess I'm not</font>

59
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,268
really a gamer I don't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

60
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,679
just I'd rather hack could play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

61
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,200
computers uniques terminal screen I'm

62
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,020
good but my son's a big fan of evolved

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,260
and he came

64
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">me he's you know boys 14 now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,270

76
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,660
basically in front of the computer all

77
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,690
day and while that's going on of course

78
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,690
I'm dicking around in my lab and up pops

79
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,430
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a warning on my system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now those</font>

80
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember i run a DLP engine home well my</font>

81
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,180
dlp by default is actually configured

82
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,519
that under system load if the system

83
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,470
actually starts to experience a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos</font>

84
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,060
type attack of course it starts pulling

85
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,920
resources from other stuff like turns

86
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,110
out the DLP engine to deal with

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,609
whatever's coming on but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

88
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,580
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an enterprise-grade</font>

89
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,340
firewall sitting in my house so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

90
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,170
should never happen I'm just so a house

91
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,990
is just a few people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of a sudden</font>

92
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,600
this pops up what the heck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

93
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,360
and I look at the firewall<font color="#CCCCCC"> I login and I</font>

94
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,820
am most definitely under a ddos attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,580
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being flooded like mad the box</font>

96
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,930
is hurtin however to its<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit it did</font>

97
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,130
its job it stirred shutting out some

98
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,390
other services and just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

99
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,160
forward packets let's just keep things

100
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,359
moving and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it crippled longer the cool</font>

101
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,549
thing was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house nobody even</font>

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,580
noticed my son tournament played along

103
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,709
just fine I did some more digging though

104
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,140
and discovered just before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D das hit</font>

105
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,420
my son<font color="#CCCCCC"> was fished into clicking on a</font>

106
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,859
link and what happened was he was ranked

107
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,720
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two in the tournament at</font>

108
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,360
that time and somebody wanted to knock

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,040
him out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they tricked him they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font>

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,080
his IP address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately me</font>

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,079
and boom income the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D das ran for about</font>

112
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,000
an hour and a half and I've heard

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,410
stories about this and my son<font color="#E5E5E5"> even told</font>

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,060
me only other services we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

115
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,560
can go and pay money and if you know

116
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,930
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and they even have services</font>

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they offer you that will find the IP for</font>

118
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,750
you and Hammer it so I now officially

119
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,770
have to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> D das to the amount of</font>

120
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,329
services you're going to need at home

121
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,959
particular if you have teenagers of play

122
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,330

124
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,169

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,889
technical issues with coffee I can camp

143
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,229
in the middle of nowhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make great</font>

144
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">coffee what is the problem here</font>

145
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,260
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this actually went on and</font>

146
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,960
on so I was stunned I finally found one

147
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,830
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and it turns out it was</font>

148
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,340
open because the manager at this store

149
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,340
knew how to count

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,320
it turns out there was nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

151
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,719
with the coffee systems their cash

152
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,930
system had failed and since there was no

153
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,419
machine to process money oh well

154
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,430
business closed over but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy who</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">old-school guy he's like well you know</font>

156
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,610

<font color="#E5E5E5">count</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna I it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hit me</font>

158
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,039
though how impactful this is becoming in

159
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,840
our world and how there's a generation

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,150
coming up behind us that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is becoming</font>

161
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,070
completely depend on us remember what it

162
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,989
was like when female didn't work or when

163
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,370
he didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it and what he</font>

164
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect we live in a world where you know</font>

165
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,160
I have two USB charge and manage my

hand stay nice and warm I show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

174
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,599
Israelis I laughed their heads off it

175
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,889
like wow you could 80 in suits hey you

176
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,539
got a shovel the driveway but if you

177
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,340
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it though this is actually from</font>

178
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">grab from one of course slides this is a</font>

179
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,060
World Economic Forum and they did kind

180
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,090
of a poll of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and what's</font>

181
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,039
interesting is the fear of cyber attack

182
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,979
and all the stuff that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,330
talk about here at what surprises me at

184
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,159
rates at all because again I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

185
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,289
came from a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> when by the way full</font>

186
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:02,110
disclosure I am old<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right just</font>

187
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,370
people tell me I look yo you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at old</font>

188
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,080
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're just being polite so</font>

189
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,539
thank you very much but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am all but I</font>

190
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,830
remember time where that wasn't even the

191
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,270
consideration I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to debate</font>

192
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,859
with customers about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they</font>

193
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,810
needed a firewall on their their

194
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,260
internet connection oh it's connected

195
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,880
it's fine nobody wants my stuff um but

196
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,440
what is interesting it's it ranks

197
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,330
actually hired an extreme weather event

198
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,979
so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually people more</font>

199
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,479
frightened and and think it's more

200
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,859
realistic that you know cyber attacks

201
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,659
you heard and then like say a hurricane

202
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,010
or something I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure that's</font>

203
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:35,199
entirely true yet but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried that</font>

204
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,490
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and of course the</font>

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,740
more things we integrate the more

206
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,469
dependent we become on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as a society</font>

207
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,330
the more risks we face from all these

208
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,870
other you know organizations going to

209
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,539
shut you

210
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,120
down based on you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

211
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks right things happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony I'd</font>

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,930
say the things that happened Ashley

213
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,400
Madison but did you know their their

214
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,670
enrollment actually went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

215
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,320
data dump and that weird like a whole

216
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,490
bunch of people dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> with oh crap is a</font>

217
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,250
place where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to have affairs I</font>

218
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,700
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did you hear the part</font>

219
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,580
of where they lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the data nobody</font>

220
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,400
cares but and that's you know I'm

221
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,380
ultimately Ashley Madison's failing is

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,539
that they forgot they weren't a hook-up

223
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,510
company they were a privacy company

224
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what their value was and I</font>

225
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,110
think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost sight of that by wait</font>

226
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,240
who everybody grab the Ashley Madison

227
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,690
dump wasn't a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun it's a great</font>

228
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,920
way to learn SQL<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i first</font>

229
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,260
downloaded i was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an Ashley</font>

230
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,370
Madison party where I was going to set

231
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,720
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and put like a little web</font>

232
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,159
interface and we'll invite all their

233
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,080
friends over and anybody can run

234
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,900
searches off of the local<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and I</font>

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,030
thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hilarious except</font>

236
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,340
when the data actually got down on even

237
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,140
my biggest machine a single query was

238
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,090
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven minutes to return</font>

239
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,920
I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't going to scale</font>

240
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,380
well so and then I actually looked at

241
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,670
some of the data saw some names i knew

242
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,330
and went you know what I'm just gonna

243
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,800
shut this whole thing down we're done do

244
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,330
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> included GPS coordinates to</font>

245
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,400
that's a lot of fun pipe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

246
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,260
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Maps putting your postal</font>

247
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,090
code anyway I'm getting outside the area

248
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,610
but what we really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

249
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,080
his DevOps for the home so how this came

250
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,850
about was when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that weaponized</font>

251
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,740
security and people saw hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

252
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,150
stuff I was doing at home there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

253
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,380
lot of questions I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lana hey</font>

254
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,750
how did you set this up how'd you do

255
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,300
that and so originally this was going to

256
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,920
be a whole how I'd set up my home

257
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,329
internal network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font>

258
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,740
spawned over the last year I really

259
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,620
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a more educational</font>

260
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,740
interactive a little different however

261
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,230
during the course of me doing that a lot

262
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,930
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things change for me I moved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

263
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,970
completely different model in terms of

264
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,949
how I managed even my own stuff just in

265
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,920
my house<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

266
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,870
explain I my house is probably not that

267
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,370
normal relative to the rest of the world

268
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you guys I'm sure this would be fine</font>

269
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,150
I run my own servers I run my own

270
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,339
services I've always done that I just I

271
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,050
don't know any different

272
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,550
you know only<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently started getting</font>

273
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,109
into cloud stuff I used to be very anti

274
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,579
cloud if you saw me in 2008 I was

275
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,439
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around doing it presentational</font>

276
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:05,649
virtually safe where I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mocked cloud</font>

277
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,870
as a ridiculous concept and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

278
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,959
here partly as an apology<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go oh man</font>

279
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,110
how I'm in the cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually kind</font>

280
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,670
of like it a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is based on it</font>

281
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,899
was really triggered on and credit where

282
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,939
credit's due there's a great

283
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,230

many one in depth on netflix I'm

285
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,639
actually very fascinated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix as</font>

286
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,258
an organization and I kind of use them

as my model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps because here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

challenge with DevOps right we always

289
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,459
love to throw that term around but it

290
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps isn't a product it is even really</font>

291
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,998
a process it's actually more like a

292
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,920
state of mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> as goofy as that sounds</font>

293
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,540
it's really a way of thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> away the</font>

297
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,189
I met with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest telecom</font>

298
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,930
providers who said hey we'd really like

00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,149
you to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our dev ops team I'm like</font>

301
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,999
here's the network here's the security

302
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,189
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a couple different groups</font>

303
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm like where's the app people well

304
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,910
that's a different group you've already

305

<font color="#E5E5E5">failed they have to all be in the room</font>

terms of i<font color="#E5E5E5"> love this slide because he</font>

308
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,290
starts talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences</font>

309
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,199
between you know their approach and

310
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,579
traditional and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder how wacky</font>

this but i'll share it just case you

313
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,100
haven't anybody heard of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chaos</font>

314
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,779
monkey if you're the chaos monkey so

315
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
does you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the chaos monkey in</font>

316
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,620
netflix and they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quite a while</font>

317
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,300
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't that it is a service an</font>

318
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,410
application that runs within the netflix

319

<font color="#E5E5E5">i environment by the way does everybody</font>

320
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,009
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> netflix is just completely running</font>

321
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,389
amazon they don't have any data center

322

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're just basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're most of</font>

323
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:36,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazon at this point they created a</font>

324
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,100
program called chaos monkey and what

325
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,379
chaos monkey does is run around their

326
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,749
floats around the the netflix

327
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,189
infrastructure and randomly and without

328
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:50,499
warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns off servers and services</font>

329
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:52,509
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody had to walk in</font>

330
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,310
to the executive and say hey I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

331
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,390
great idea

332
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,010
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create this application</font>

333
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,470
it's get a roam around it's going to

334
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,040
break everything and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy had the</font>

335
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,660
foresight to go that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome get doing</font>

336
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,520
the consequence of that those developers

337
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,199
have to survive the chaos monkey in

338
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,910
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into production now they</font>

339
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,370
actually experienced a geographical

340
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,990
outage from amazon which translated into

341
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five-minute recovery time for</font>

342
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazon based on their their past model</font>

343
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,750
which was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough for them think</font>

344
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how many businesses day would</font>

345
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,740
love a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-minute recovery time from an</font>

346
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,900
entire geographical outage wasn't good

347
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,740
enough for them so they introduced a

348
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:33,980
program called the chaos gorilla chaos

349
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">karela runs about once a quarter again</font>

350
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,670
it's also random but Emma's or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix</font>

357
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,640
think about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's beyond you know</font>

358
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these little points about agility</font>

baked failure into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font>

361
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,730
services so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say this upfront that</font>

362
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,860
if your application people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't in the</font>

room with your network and and everybody

364
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,440
else it's never going to work so why do

programmer I'm lazy I try to do

390
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,040
everything in Perl because it's what I

know

392
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,420
I don't mind hacking up someone else's

back in time so every remember when the

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a huge thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right about</font>

404
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,969
friends on IRC we collectively got

405
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,190
together because it took in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

406
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,940
neighborhood of you know six to eight

407
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,740
hours to crunch out an album OCD we got

408
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,899
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we started using this this</font>

409
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,630
compression algorithm and actually took

410
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,670
my entire album collection and converted

411
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,040
it because here is the thing I had

412
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,319
stacks of CDs my entire life I've loved

413
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,199
music<font color="#E5E5E5"> always for every paycheck I got</font>

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,759
every week I go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy some album</font>

415
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,709
sometimes I liked it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it wasn't</font>

416
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,269
I've amassed a massive collection you

417
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,300
could literally pile it in we many

418
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,620
wheelbarrows<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unwieldly it's</font>

419
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,939
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font>

420
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,670
remember those days you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

421
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,829
your albums around and tire collections

422
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,000
but I had literally just tons of cds and

423
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:21,260
of course you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a party your</font>

424
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,800
friends come over and the cds end up

425
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,769
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hated that so this for</font>

426
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,800
me was awesome and with a helpful out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

427
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,750
people so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have an issue buying</font>

428
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,069
music has never really been a problem

429
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,440
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem for me has been I</font>

430
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:38,779
didn't like the 4matic came in I wanted

431
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">something portable accessible etc so</font>

432
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:44,800
long before<font color="#E5E5E5"> these services came out i</font>

433
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,380
moved to mp3s as many people did anyway

434
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,019
not out of you know piracy etc but just

435
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,970
it was easier by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I kept this I</font>

436
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,260
kept the cds around for a long time

437
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,970
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought at the time was like</font>

438
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jesus anybody ever you know to call me</font>

439
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,240
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I got you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know fine I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

440
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,359
bring in wheelbarrows full of cds and go

441
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,860
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought like six copies of dark</font>

442
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,540
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the moon over my lifetime right</font>

443
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,740
the tape died then i got the album then

444
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,870
there was a gold edition<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there was</font>

445
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:13,279
the box set and then you're going to

446
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:16,279
begrudge me one damn mp3 really so

447
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,019
having settled that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generally speaking</font>

448
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,459
my music is all the mp3 based although

449
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,880
I'm now actually moving to FLAC but

450
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,660
that's a different story

451
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,770
um now when it came to movies um

452
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,600
especially again back then we're going

453
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,670
back in time um<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I knew how to</font>

454
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">crack and convert movies the time it</font>

455
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,540
took and the cost and the time would

456
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,130
take to download was just outrageous in

457
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,610
my mind I'm like just go to the store

458
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get the DVD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AIDS fast and easy rent</font>

459
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,890
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> however actually I like to collect</font>

460
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,599
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of movies too however same kind of</font>

461
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,939
problem I didn't like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media aspect</font>

462
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,620
but I dealt with it because it wasn't

463
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite as bad as the is the seedy side</font>

464
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,310
and you know I can manage it at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

465
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,640
thought I could but then I had you know

466
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,170
a little child runnin around and then

467
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,600
you've had to raise a child when they're

468
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:04,260
really young very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low attention spans</font>

469
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,270
high<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy very bursts very a lot to</font>

470
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,819
look after and so I discovered my son

471
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,609
really really liked the movie Finding

472
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,170
Nemo<font color="#E5E5E5"> every remember finding nemo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a</font>

473
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,240
funny most so of course i get the DVD

474
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,100
and if you tell my son hey finding

475
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,079
nemo's on he'd be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah throw in the</font>

476
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,240
DVD and even though I'd fully paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

477
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,430
this DVD I'd have to sit through like I

478
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know six screens of don't copy yet</font>

479
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't copy it up bought it that's the</font>

480
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,530
only way you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen the problem</font>

481
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,960
i ran into<font color="#CCCCCC"> was my son's attention span</font>

482
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,850
was not necessarily long enough to make

483
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,410
it through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and boom he was back off</font>

484
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,659
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else I mean truth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be told if</font>

485
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,610
he would watch 20 minutes of Finding

486
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,890
Nemo that was me collapsed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the couch</font>

487
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,060
for 20 minutes I'll take it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

488
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even get that 20 minutes</font>

489
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,710
because I couldn't get him damn the past

490
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,270
and past the damn things oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

491
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my other favorite part after i</font>

492
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,430
get past all these warnings even though

493
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,360
i bought this thing it would actually

494
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,680
still run preview oh so I jump back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

495
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,590
jumped ahead it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> still run a</font>

496
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,720
preview of some other show a movie it

497
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,060
was ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I actually started</font>

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,890
ripping movies and doing electronically

499
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,020
for the simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that I had to bypass</font>

500
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,760
these menus if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to get even just</font>

501
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,800
20 or 30 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my son's attention</font>

502
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,500
distracted so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could collapse or have a</font>

503
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,970
bite to eat or something I know it

504
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,460
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cheesy challenge but after</font>

505
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,530
days and days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of no sleep with babies</font>

506
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,600
and kids you're like I'm doing anything

507
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,060
I can to get any minute I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font>

508
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,199
a sudden I embarked upon all right I'm

509
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start download my movie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then a</font>

510
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,740
storm that way I rip them that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

511
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,780
then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's TV</font>

512
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,330
now with TV because of the way I travel

513
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,920
I don't live in a world where I can be

514
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,659
home every night thursday at eight

515
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,520
o'clock to watch your stupid show I

516
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,720
don't even like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your show that much that</font>

517
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,730
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> even care about being home</font>

518
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,620
through so for many years of my life was

519
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,110
quickly traveling for work I just never

520
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,520
watch TV I hear people talk about the

521
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,379
survivor thing I've ever came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I'm</font>

524
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:05,399
I'd always had TV service at home and

the industry they've they've come along

552
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,990
unfortunately I haven't come along fast

553
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,270
enough for me because I went ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

embarked<font color="#CCCCCC"> on developing servers and</font>

my house I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in that and</font>

560
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,000

561
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,160
getting what it is I want I realize now

562

565
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,120
what it looks like and how it operates

566
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,230
it's all managed through a web interface

567
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,659
it's accessible inside my house there's

568
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,990
a TV component it's got a nice little

569
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,330
guide piece there that goes through

570

573
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:00,170
going out and getting it the way it

574
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,020
operates is these are scrapers that

575
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,120
really just run around looking through

576
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,670
usually uses newsgroups they could use

577
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,760
torrent there's a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways it</font>

578
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,650
feeds it to a downloading engine which

579
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,740
in turn well here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my little downloader</font>

585
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,100
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you're coming down now</font>

586
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,629
especially in this day and age the pipes

587
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,699
everything he<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets some pretty decent</font>

588
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,429

589
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,380
comes down stores on my local<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nath</font>

591
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,350
terabytes at this point I've now moved

592
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:45,110
it up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terabytes a little look at</font>

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,419
the storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and then for delivery</font>

594
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,250
i was using another XBMC it's got a

595

596
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,020
went with plex any plex users out there

597
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,939
Plex is pretty cool you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font>

604
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,530
application um so then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

605
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,960
actually have here is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

606
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,200
application flow stack like a DevOps

607
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,870
kind of thing and the other issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

608
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,850
running into was that I have an ESX

609
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,979
server at home the Naza separate

610
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,320
physical device and it's running the

611
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,179
downloaded components in freebsd jails

612
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,280
that'll be important in a minute we'll

613
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:33,559
talk about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running a</font>

614
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,990
unix servers with all these components

615
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">here a few other things I'm also running</font>

616
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,850
all the components that<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage and run</font>

617
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,389
my infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my house for my</font>

618
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:47,480
corp again corporate level stuff my ESX

619
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:50,210
server truth be told is kind of old it's

620
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,250
a little long in the tooth it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

621
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,350
and of course I'm lazy and don't want to

622
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,300
spend the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upgrade it and</font>

623
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that happen well actually</font>

624
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,090
I was in the point of upgrading it but I

625
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,679
had an interesting experience I went to

626
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,389
meet with a customer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were taught</font>

627
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,070
about different<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff you guys know</font>

628
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:05,479
where works<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no secret the</font>

629
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,689
customers told me because well we're

630
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do some stuff in amazon and</font>

631
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,299
we're trying to leverage your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon you</font>

632
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:16,309
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> security services but they they</font>

633
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:18,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't work and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bought it so wet by the</font>

634
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,019
way if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer minded and you want</font>

635
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:23,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to me about a technical issue it</font>

636
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:27,830
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is not a technical issue</font>

637
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,809
you've literally told me nothing what

638
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,249
doesn't work how does it work of course

639
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,019
as I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this question this</font>

640
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:34,970
guy's just give me the walls just it's

641
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,369
all broken and so I'm like all right to

642
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,960
be fair I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> played with it myself</font>

643
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,908
personally but I have a hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

644
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,210
believing we'd be selling and deploying

645
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:45,740
this if it didn't work so I wouldn't

646
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,659
actually back to my hotel room that

647
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,450
night logged in remotely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my home</font>

648
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,759
network and set up an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon VPC into my</font>

649
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,869
house that night so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day we</font>

650
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,879
had to follow up meeting the next day I

651
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:58,279
went oh by the way on that comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

652
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:59,928
amazon i did that my house last night

653
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,340
buddy what do you mean it doesn't work

654
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,980
turns out his issue was he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

655
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,809
understand subnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> e because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as</font>

656
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,799
we say all the networks irrelevant you

657
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,230
still have to understand a bit about

658
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,179
networks so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i knew this and I</font>

659
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,399
now had hooked in this Amazon component

660
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:16,429
I was like wow this Amazon things kind

661
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:17,989

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,670
finding this out if you have them<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

704
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,280
that grab them quickly and run and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

705
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,860
because I guarantee bad things are

706
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening there is nothing safe in the</font>

707
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,479
cloud it's just connected the network is

708
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:04,270
this isn't a different world so I'm

709
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I crash and create</font>

710
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:10,129
two instances within my<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPC now this v</font>

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,850
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> op server and I call an op server</font>

714
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,770
it's really just a freebsd server that

715
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,510
runs the networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns all this kind of</font>

716
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,460
stuff I really use it like my network

717
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,960
controller that's a bit of a stretch

718
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,300
because truth be told I have it's a

719
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,190
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got 17</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're 17</font>

720
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,480
at home from a network controller

721
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,730
perspective I could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> redirect some</font>

722
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,020
dns it works great when I set up a

723
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,490
server i called it dev server because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

724
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,220
figured well let's see develop this

725
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,170
stuff see if it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it up and</font>

726
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,850
running and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know VPN</font>

727
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,670
actually run beautifully got lots of

728
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">speed they did work flawlessly across</font>

729
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:49,610
even to the point of streaming video

730
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:52,370
across of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually uh well at</font>

731
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,199
one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i moved so i move the sickness</font>

732
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,399
eat couch<font color="#CCCCCC"> torrent and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once I got the</font>

00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,500
morning on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dev this is the cool</font>

734
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,060
thing about Amazon you can template it's

735
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,040
just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON templates you could</font>

736
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,379
template the thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just boom so as</font>

737
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,030
soon as I got a working instance boom

738
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,920
what goes into production and it's all

739
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,450
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm loving and I still my</font>

740
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,100
dev server I can muck with it I could

741
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,600
test my upgrades before they go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

742
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,370
because every now and then I upgrade a

743
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,050
component like sick beard and my wife

744
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,669
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be out of TV for 24 hours because</font>

745
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,430
I'm busy now I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it and Oh</font>

746
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,350
believe me I never hear the end of that

747
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,030
and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually totally sympathetic</font>

748
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,870
to bail and the support calls they must

749
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">take from TV because now they go to me</font>

750
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,779
and from a cost for

751
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,190
spective it was actually pretty

752
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,929
reasonable I've got it kind of balanced

753
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,000
out now ago twenty-five thirty bucks a

754
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,429
month give or take I'm one thing I won't

755
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,440
caution you though when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first did it I</font>

756
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,179
went whole hog and I moved everything

757
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,840
including I started storing stuff in

758
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:46,909
Amazon goal and this is awesome here's a

759
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,899
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a warning and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

760
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:50,389
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably true with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cloud</font>

761
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,918
services just<font color="#E5E5E5"> FYI if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

762
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:53,870
this at home because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you get</font>

763
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,360
caught with what I got um it's

764
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,289
incredibly cheap to put data into the

765
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,600
cloud very cheap it's not so cheap if

766
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,158
you want to take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and here's what</font>

767
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I discovered after a month of uploading</font>

768
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,440
data in there and running it in and

769
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,510
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> went you know I got this whole</font>

770
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nass here just moved it up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

771
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,799
terabits<font color="#E5E5E5"> stories kind of grown there you</font>

772
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,399
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd rather have it in my</font>

773
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:20,179
house and leverage compute and of course

774
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:24,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it back the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next month's bill</font>

775
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:26,510
was not pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just FYI by the way</font>

776
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,949
people say you think what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix their</font>

777
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,169
massive right they must have a massive

778
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,639
database and I've heard the comment for

779
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,990
why don't they set up their own data

780
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">center like they could literally be</font>

781
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,159
their own data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center easily and I'm</font>

782
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,350
betting imagine the cost they would pay

783
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,690
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data out amazon their</font>

784
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,889
trinsic lee tied together<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just bring</font>

785
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">that up as something to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind</font>

786
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:49,459
about storing data however having said

787
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,709
all that there's a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy solution my</font>

788
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,440
storage and my data resides in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

789
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use Amazon for compute I</font>

790
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,080
just want you to do some key<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want some</font>

791
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,880
cpu time send the data my way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font>

792
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,230
consequence i've got this you know to

793
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,539
flee from my perspective lovely little

794
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,250
setup now when it first started doing it

795
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:12,580
there's my eye are cee client the corner

796
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:15,289
and yes i still use IRC<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have my my</font>

797
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,730
which one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my off server so this one's</font>

798
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,620
doing all the connections through

799
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,809
managing the network communicating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

800
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,120
main Network brings the servers online

801
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,519
for me I got my<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev in my prod you see</font>

802
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,889
the prods obviously much busier than

803
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the dev stuff and it's all there</font>

804
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:32,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">all images so I create common scripts</font>

805
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,678
much like now I didn't go as far as

806
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,240
putting in puppet those you know puppet

807
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,710
it's you know puppet master runs

808
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,909
everything same kind of concept though I

809
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,470
had consistent scripts that it ran

810
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,720
exactly the same on<font color="#CCCCCC"> every one of them</font>

811
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,730
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to manage to look after</font>

812
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,560
um I thought I was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know pretty cool</font>

813
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,750
for school I can move all this stuff

814
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">around not only that I realized playing</font>

815
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,950
with some of the amazon stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

816
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,480
template and replicate this at a

817
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,000
ridiculous scale so if for whatever

818
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,350
reason my family grows by you know two

819
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,500
or three hundred percent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

820
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:03,740
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not expecting that by the way</font>

821
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">but in the event that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

confess<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this amazon thing and by</font>

825
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,620
reality is is they're all kind of the

826
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,080
same services they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> or their nuances</font>

827
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,300
little differences here and there but

828
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,820
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to scale out and work</font>

829
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,360
through it is fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then to the</font>

830
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:26,360
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in play</font>

831
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,370
with the s3 buckets so i used to run a

832
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,959
web server online long time ago of

833
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,070
course was just a dumb webster<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a</font>

834
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,780
horrible web designer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just ran it</font>

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd put stuff on there really just</font>

836
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,510
for me personally however<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

837
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,490
bit of an issue where it sooner or later

838
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,900
it's going to get popped right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

839
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">come I've come to that realization</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> many years ago just sooner or</font>

later I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have time to maintain it I</font>

842
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,010
can't just leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sitting there so I</font>

843
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">just gave up running a web server much</font>

844
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,770
like I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> up running a mail server</font>

845
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,899
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run my own mail server in my</font>

846
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:01,580
house until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spam thing just became</font>

847
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:03,560
such an issue it just wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth it so</font>

848
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:10,510
I actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let me to see if I've got</font>

849
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:10,510
my oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> still here</font>

850
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to take you inside the system</font>

851
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,420
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got it logged in</font>

852
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:26,780
you can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all can you so</font>

853
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,309
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tricky part I said I want to</font>

854
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,309
do something live and I'm hoping that

855
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:46,639
better so I have this domain I can zip

856
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:52,340
right in and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into my what's</font>

857
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:54,260
going on here so what's going on is I

858
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,689
actually have a simple actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

859
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">just show you so as you know I run an</font>

860
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,630
IRC client I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you</font>

861
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,300
some of the IRC channels I'm in because

862
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,350
you'd be like what the hell is that crap

863
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if they're interesting let me just</font>

864
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,928
say old hacker ones i actually have my

865
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,340
twitter is actually tied into IRC they

866
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,770
probably go what are you doing that who

867
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,000
still uses terminals and actually be

868
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,480
surprised I mean the terminal quite a

869
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,790
bit but that's actually not what I use

870
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,980
it for I use it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I log everything</font>

871
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:26,480
that goes on inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this client and</font>

872
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:29,320
using a simple perl script you guys like

873
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,510
bruh you guys play with fur a little

874

877
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:45,428
simple perl script grabs the the the

878
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:50,660
logs generates a little HTML for me and

879
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:53,480
uses the s3 to push it up to just bring

880
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,190
my web browser up so everybody got<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

881
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,070
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has their computers and stuff</font>

885
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,270
is there's actually some interesting

886
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,880
links to plot pop up in here I take no

887
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,780
responsibility for some of them if you

888

893
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,909

be my guest have fun and what I wanted

895
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you was I discovered something</font>

896
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:39,080
while I was playin around he know

897
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:40,970
freebsd jails and that was docker

898
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,820
containers now who here is playing with

899
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,680
docker containers everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

900
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,090
and look at this technology now truth be

901
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,770
told I really actually did<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

902
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">better when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was called freebsd jails</font>

903
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,100
because it is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just freebsd</font>

904
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,969
jails but they put this interface on top

905
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,659
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that allows me to container eyes</font>

906
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,550
application so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh what</font>

907
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">does that mean what's the difference it</font>

908
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,810
makes them completely portable and then

909
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move them like an application I</font>

910
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,790
can upgrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> them independently I can run</font>

911
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:13,659
them in all sorts of ways so for example

912
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:16,850
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to kill up CX anyone there now</font>

913
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,909
if you click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it you're actually going</font>

914
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see my full TV system here this is</font>

915
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated one I actually use an</font>

916
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,270
offshoot now called the sick rage same

917
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea so this is live right now on the</font>

918
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,360
internet if anybody wants to log in and

919
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,250
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it be my guest and by the</font>

920
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">way feel free to muck with it all you</font>

921
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,330
want because you know what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

922
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,460
inside a container<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

923
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,469
compartmentalized own little world it's

924
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,639
not my real version of what you see

925
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,379
that's running in my house that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

926
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,668
manages everything you're seeing a

927
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,870
containerized and different

928
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">containerized version that by the way</font>

929
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,730
has a read-only access and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can blow up</font>

930
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,620
in a second and restore exactly the way

931
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,418
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see how powerful these</font>

932
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:57,139
are who is anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here clicking on the</font>

933
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:58,430
website or has access to it no one's

934
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to confess to it you guys probably</font>

935
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,830
scared to click on it you got it right

936
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:10,730
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's play a game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

937
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:13,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into my all right so I'm going to do</font>

938
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,510
stop

939
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:22,770
is is anything can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you access it now</font>

940
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:28,680
probably not working too good right how

941
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:33,270
about now now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna stop it oh now</font>

942
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,368
it's going on now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's back it's</font>

943
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,460
literally a fast that servers up and

944
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,810
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rock now if everything okay why</font>

945
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing us that that's ridiculous</font>

946
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,849
but there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said I saw in</font>

947
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:49,920
that that really opened my mind and that

948
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">was if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you think about from</font>

949
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,520
security perspective what the docker

950
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,509
means I have been back in 2008 I

951
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,460
actually argued that server

952
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,830
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> had not gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far enough</font>

953
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,300
where is my just in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel that</font>

954
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,460
launches threads does whatever it needs

955
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,290
in that booth can disappear<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a puff of</font>

956
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,070
smoke Don then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found Dockers</font>

957
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,259
especially with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the controllers they</font>

958
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,849
have and it integrates into<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON</font>

959
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,310
templates it could be automated through

960
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:16,260
tons of automation tools on demand now

961
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,240
think about this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can set up an</font>

962
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,470
instance the flow comes in service the

963
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,779
request and when the request is done

964
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,669
gone somebody pops that web server the

965
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,770
next time they connect back into it boom

966
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,720
original image again not only that you

967
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">can dip the images in real time and see</font>

968
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,419
what's change has been made we're

969
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,910
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at now some way of extracting</font>

970
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe doing some threat analysis on</font>

971
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,770
it it changes the whole game in scope

972
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,450
and but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of why you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

973
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,400
bring your<font color="#E5E5E5"> development team in there</font>

974
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,140
case in point those s3 buckets I'm

975
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,550
pushing to you see right now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

976
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,080
a flat tax you can hack that all you

977
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,700
want it's just need overwritten by

978
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,009
buckets there's different things we

979
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:54,330
could do them beyond just pure security

980
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:55,859
access but along those lines this is my

981
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:59,130
security cat she hangs out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in my</font>

982
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:01,560
lab all the time what does this mean for

983
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and I bring this back to to</font>

984
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,240
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in business my security is</font>

985
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,160
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to manage at home because</font>

986
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,109
it's fairly small but if you consider

987
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,879
taking this kind of flexibility and

988
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:14,009
capability this<font color="#E5E5E5"> portability to move all</font>

989
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,130
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and dynamically fly up</font>

990
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,440
applications and you look at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

991
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,820
built things over time right what's

992
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we doing we</font>

993
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,320
really don't care right and you know

994
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're talking about oh my gosh the</font>

995
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,310
internet you know oh it's protect

996
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,640
we blocked it off I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

997
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:36,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">true when I go to most data centers it's</font>

998
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,660
really not that way at all and the

999
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,370
analogy in this credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the credit</font>

1000
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,230
goes this came from a gentleman work

1001
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,089
with by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of John Michaelson he</font>

1002
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,760
describes it as herding cats<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1003
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,260
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our security of today is now</font>

1004
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just dealing with these herded</font>

1005
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,340
cats if you've ever tried to like direct

1006
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,589
a cat to do something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how great</font>

1007
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,290
it is usually gets scratched or bitten

1008
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,730
or ignored not unlike you know how the

1009
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,100
security team gets treated it works

1010
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:02,440
sometimes right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a scary</font>

1011
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,589
scary person so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1012
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,000
ultimately mean you look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1013
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,500
what's the tenements of security what

1014
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,290
are we supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing or the basis</font>

1015
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,460
the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything we do</font>

1016
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">segmentation all right this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

1017
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">rocket science we know this customers</font>

1018
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,020
know this and theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do</font>

1019
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,270
this today wonderfully we have physical

1020
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,500
infrastructure setups that model this

1021
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,080
out beautifully so they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

1022
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,710
this stack with layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security in</font>

1023
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,380
between each component however when I go

1024
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:35,770
visit my customers what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually see is</font>

1025
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,540
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks more like this and</font>

1026
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,009
as we're looking at it trying to figure

1027
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,750
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to segment it there's more stuff</font>

1028
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,710
popping into it and it's plugged in in

1029
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,810
there don't get me wrong there's maybe

1030
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,060
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs but nobody's really tracked</font>

1031
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,730
it nobody really has any idea why or how

1032
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,290
and but rather than deal with a

1033
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,600
segmentation hey i just threw more

1034
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,759
threat prevention on the front end don't

1035
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,830
want a segmentation we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus</font>

1036
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,600
on that and oh by the way while we were

1037
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,370
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this oh did we mention we actually</font>

1038
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,299
move some service from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D of Z into</font>

1039
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,790
the back end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1040
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,960
punch some holes through anyway stop me

1041
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,580
if this doesn't sound like your

1042
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,220
environment I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you and</font>

1043
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,620
then oh my absolute favorite part if

1044
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,390
you're lucky users are connected through

1045
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,740
some kind of access control device<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

1046
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,290
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases I've seen the connected</font>

1047
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,299
right to the data center because it's a

1048
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,220
trusted network I love them people you

1049
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh it's the users network it's trusted</font>

1050
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,689
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to think is are you out of</font>

1051
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:28,060
your mind have you met users on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1052
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet today you can't trust them they</font>

1053
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,320
have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing they'll</font>

1054
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,600
click anything they don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> any times</font>

1055
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,730
we've gone on for an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like a</font>

1056
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident response and you find that</font>

1057
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,859
patient zero it's the same story<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1058
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,930
like well I got this email on it

1059
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:46,670
kind of suspicious yeah clicked on it

1060
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:50,308
anyway didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because</font>

1061
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,180
we have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know how to</font>

1062
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,980
create an environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they can</font>

1063
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,259
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on anything in anything they want</font>

1064
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so I by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I blame a lot of</font>

1065
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,950
this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware although they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

1066
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:00,598
only hypervisor out there there's lots

1067
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,930
of note there so truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is lots of blame</font>

1068
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,999
to go around they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so easy for</font>

1069
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,940
the server team just sprawl right out

1070
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:12,839
and grow that network and security it

1071
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,430
barely keep up to them so I don't like

1072
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">to leave things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a downer although I</font>

1073
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,019
usually end up doing that somehow it's

1074
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,849
not my intention so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it</font>

1075
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:22,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">better how is this supposed to look and</font>

1076
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:24,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we get into automation</font>

1077
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,089
people talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> SD DC and sdn there's</font>

1078
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,369
all these concepts thrown around much

1079
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:31,828
like DevOps itself it's not really a

1080
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:33,749
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> product but more of a state of</font>

1081
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind a practice a process behind it</font>

1082
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:38,129
which really it starts with some kind of

1083
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:39,299
cloud level management now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't this</font>

1084
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,339
I haven't even listed everything that's

1085
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:43,230
in here there's your OpenStack your

1086
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,880
VMware the vcenter vSphere which is

1087
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,410
probably in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of organizations you</font>

1088
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,029
get the a pic this<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudStack there's</font>

1089
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,440
tons<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source there's no specific</font>

1090
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,549
what they all do the same thing though

1091
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,009
in a matter of fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all work with</font>

1092
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:54,930
each other to a large degree and it's

1093
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really based on being able to handle</font>

1094
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,190
objects templated objects objects and

1095
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,799
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's right actions and this template</font>

1096
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,960
can tell the hypervisor to create the

1097
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:04,859
server of this type that needs access to

1098
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,470
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they'll have all these</font>

1099
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,170
parameters but those same parameters can

1100
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:12,118
be passed to a network controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CI</font>

1101
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,940
of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> openstax to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the neutron</font>

1102
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,710
there's again a ton of them and it in

1103
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,089
turn can provide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact virtual</font>

1104
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,369
network in real time no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware's</font>

1105
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:22,680
carved out nothing just doom<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok here's a</font>

1106
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,499
network access you need by the same

1107
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,868
token we also have the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

1108
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:29,578
this information with security services

1109
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:31,859
so you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your new web server</font>

1110
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,739
it accesses the internet it handles this

1111
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:37,019
level of data sensitivity so your

1112
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,539
security services can be dynamically

1113
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:42,118
loaded up and this to work across all

1114
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers it's quite amazing even to</font>

1115
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,910
the point where we're playing with

1116
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:46,319
technology now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it receives</font>

1117
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,999
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

1118
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,759
controllers but it can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk back to</font>

1119
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:52,709
them and say hey network that host is

1120
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,880
messed up we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad in</font>

1121
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,920
security

1122
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,260
pull it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off line they scan it forensics</font>

1123
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,570
they bring a new one in automated we've

1124
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,170
been dreaming about this it is literally

1125
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,310
here but what scares me is we're going

1126
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,530
to screw it up like we screwed up

1127
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,779
everything else before it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1128
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it because rather than create an</font>

1129
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,860
application stack that bakes all this in

1130
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,560
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any anything</font>

1131
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,470
and see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works and what's going to</font>

1132
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,500
happen oh now you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a sprawl of a</font>

1133
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,000
hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs or or a million at</font>

1134
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,560
that point there's no way you're going

1135
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me about segmentation or</font>

1136
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,380
doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that point and</font>

1137
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll be living with a horrible</font>

1138
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,040
horrible problem because by the way the

1139
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,050
services that integrate into this are

1140
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,250
much more than that but they're much

1141
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,770
more of us in a great way where you

1142
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:40,350
create CPU and memory is really a

1143
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,480
dynamic resource metering which really

1144
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,339
gives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a metric so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

1145
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,290
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create an application stack that</font>

1146
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,570
includes networking that includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1147
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,960
security one self-contained entity much

1148
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,550
like I was doing in in the Amazon I can

1149
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">neither this because the other thing</font>

1150
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,590
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start thinking about now</font>

1151
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,480
running into this we're talking

1152
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,220
customers about sdn stuff and right away

1153
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,040
the customers going what's the

1154
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,509
performance and I have the uncomfortable

1155
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,640
you know problems explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1156
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,930
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it wrong no you're just</font>

1157
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,580
dodging the question like no you're

1158
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,259
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about wrong you create</font>

1159
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,759
your application stack of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1160
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,920
components of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

1161
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,780
service micro segment on its own this

1162
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,850
creates a traffic flow that I can easily

1163
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure in a software-defined Network</font>

1164
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,440
and say this service with these number

1165
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,230
of CPUs and this access and this

1166
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,880
protection gets this much throughput and

1167
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,440
services these many users and when you

1168
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,750
know so a thousand users I can take care

1169
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,760
of it 100 megabits boo awesome what

1170
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:37,560
happens when a thousand one user comes

1171
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,500
up to play another stack go scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1172
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,299
across it's irrelevant performance piece

1173
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,610
isn't this is metering and cloud

1174
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,100
bursting you take that same stack push

1175
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,990
it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon push it into or push it all</font>

1176
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,360
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place it's actually a fantastic</font>

1177
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:54,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to do it and do it</font>

1178
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,730
right like I said I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just terrified</font>

1179
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,990
that we won't really know how to do it

1180
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,300
right that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

1181
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">usual ways by the way I didn't mean to</font>

1182
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave out any other pieces here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1183
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,320
particular the Dockers by the way

1184
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,270
doctors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the solution</font>

1185
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,800
for everything but they make a nice

1186
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,240
front end I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mean to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1187
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,030
they change the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> or their their</font>

1188
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,290
piece of the puzzle and this is where

1189
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm running into problems particularly

1190
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,310
speaking with customers and working

1191
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,200
through some of these challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

1192
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,640
it this is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very easy</font>

1193
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sit and play with these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

1194
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,270
have fun but let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to our</font>

1195
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,250
friends at Netflix and take a closer

1196
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,240
look right you know their netflix

1197
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,230
business you just do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it done</font>

1198
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,029
anyway time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to a customer like</font>

1199
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,950
yeah we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn you know</font>

1200
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,860
automation program yeah we got that

1201
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:43,080
planned out for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple years</font>

1202
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,970
hmm you want a bill DevOps type

1203
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,330
environment but you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this</font>

1204
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,490
model I say oh yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got cloud well</font>

1205
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:54,930
actually you've got a cluster of VMs all

1206
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:58,319
mashed and mish mash together do you

1207
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,029
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of test runs etc there is</font>

1208
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,590
integration several vendors really

1209
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,790
shouldn't be a problem you know moving

1210
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,950
forward we got to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

1211
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,560
working together I believe it or not one

1212
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,870
of my biggest competitors over the 14

1213
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,250
years I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> at check point has been</font>

1214
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company called Cisco you might</font>

1215
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:20,040
have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them me too recently this</font>

1216
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,150
year I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with them yeah I</font>

1217
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">never thought I'd say I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1218
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,330
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change if we say things</font>

1219
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">are changing the industry if that is an</font>

1220
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,960
indicator I know what is we are sitting

1221
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,150
down together we're developing together

1222
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,680
we're hooking in together they have some

1223
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,170
actually really cool technology that

1224
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,790
works wonderfully with ours there's some

1225
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,560
synergies going on there is some changes

1226
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:40,230
there's there's you know massive

1227
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,350
upheaval what I'm worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about though</font>

1228
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,700
is if you take that traditional approach

1229
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:47,490
and you try to apply it to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

1230
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,109
you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> failed it's doomed to</font>

1231
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,720
fail it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking well how do</font>

1232
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:55,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this right here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interesting</font>

1233
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,020
part it's all virtual it's all you carve

1234
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,370
out a piece of resources CPU hand it off

1235
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,070
to a new team and have them start

1236
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:03,600
developing the plan can't be hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1237
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,770
know this 20-year app we've had that's

1238
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,500
really awesome and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole company</font>

1239
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,570
depends on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to move an SDN you've</font>

1240
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,250
already failed you have to rethink

1241
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,900
everything not just a network not just

1242
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,910
the security but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications</font>

1243
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,270
themselves how can you leverage newer

1244
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,230
tools how can you build this you know

1245
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,720
automation and movement

1246
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,040
capability around the possibilities are

1247
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,020
endless once you get there I'm actually

1248
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,050
very excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amazing things we</font>

1249
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,550
can do but and let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we get some</font>

1250
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,530
honest answers I know I know it

1251
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,369
definitely some customers out there but

1252
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,170
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to go out and do the</font>

1253
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing we always did just on a</font>

1254
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:41,430
bigger scale and why yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

1255
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,770
why because you're probably late to the

1256
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,060
game right there's a dev ops team

1257
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,009
somewhere in the organization that's

1258
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,440
already moving ahead with this and you

1259
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,910
may not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of it so at this</font>

1260
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,560
