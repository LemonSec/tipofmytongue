109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,520
about

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
running such an online course with us in

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
this panel

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,759
so the topic we have this year for this

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,639
panel is the

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
opportunities and the challenges for

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
security journeys and events

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
in the era or in the post era of kobe

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
19.

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
so i think we can start a discussion so

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
i would like to pass my mic

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
to eden for the first question okay

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
the first question we would like to ask

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,639
of you

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
we all know that the coffee nighting has

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
made a great social impact

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
and change the way of communication

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
even defcon cdf has held virtually

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,639
i would like to ask how

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,600
we can arrange online events such as a

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,240
meeting

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
or courses

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
yep uh okay

132
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
uh kim can you uh

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,840
take the first thank you oh yes thank

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
you

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
yes uh i think that

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
it is a huge advantage to listen to the

137
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,080
very high quality presentations and

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
trainings

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
by online at a low

140
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
price i think that is very good

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
and also it is even better to be able to

142
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,080
save

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,560
flight fee and hotel fees think that is

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,919
a very good point

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,199
but but in the case of

146
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
education accompanied by the

147
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,880
experiment and the practice

148
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,240
online has some limitations

149
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
and furthermore in case of the uh online

150
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,639
presentations that

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
the education there is always a risk of

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,800
the

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,479
illegal recording okay

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,039
okay so it is a very dangerous practice

155
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,600
for the

156
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
presenters and also the education

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
educators

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
and finally the reason we attend

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
the conference is not just to the

160
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
listen to the presentation or trainings

161
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
but also

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
we want to meet the people and inspire

163
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,759
the

164
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
relationships so how to solve

165
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
this in virtual space is our future

166
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,599
homework

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,039
to be solved in the future i think so

168
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,240
yeah okay so uh khanna

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
what do you think yep um

170
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
it's a very similar yeah we we have uh

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
i mean similar challenges too uh

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,919
actually you know since coffee 19 now

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,199
when was it at

174
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,319
february or march yeah it was february

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
i had gcc event during the kobe 19

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
yeah under the 19th station so we have

177
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,400
uh eight countries i know students from

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
eight countries gathering in tokyo

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
that was a hard decision to make it but

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
anyway so

181
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,599
for me it's been over six months

182
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,560
ago but it for me it's more more years

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
like i

184
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,160
i was i'm thinking about it for years

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,720
already

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
i feel like it so but first i was

187
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,800
thinking

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,479
what is conference providing like uh

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
kim says they say and what the attendees

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
are wanting

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
and then the big thing is accidental

192
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,520
encounter like meeting people so

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
we are giving the you know interesting

194
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,080
talks in a contest and workshop party

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
and coffee

196
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,120
but uh it's a place to meet people so

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
um they find your friends business

198
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,400
partners

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
and their friends in lifetime too so

200
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,759
that's the reason why the sponsors want

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,879
to sponsor

202
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,039
and then join the event so

203
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
this is really hard to make it happen

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
but i try

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
uh the best to make the place

206
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,958
everybody can you know network and talk

207
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,080
to each other

208
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
our platform yeah our cold blue is

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
will be next month and we use

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
some kind of platform that that is

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
easier to network people

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
yeah and then also watching the movies

213
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
uh on the multiple trucks and also

214
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
now another issue is that we are facing

215
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
is uh

216
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
less submission you know small number of

217
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,279
submissions

218
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
because speakers cannot travel to tokyo

219
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
they submit their papers because they

220
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
want to come to tokyo

221
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,640
and have fun and if there's no stays

222
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
there's no tokyo trip

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,120
why why have to submit the paper so we

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
don't have many papers but

225
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,640
instead of the you know tokyo travel we

226
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,279
give them

227
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,040
like uh unreal you know payments

228
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
we we promise like we give them like up

229
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,959
to

230
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,480
1000 us dollars for one session

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
so and we have we the small number of

232
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,560
success

233
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
uh submissions but we have more serious

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,510
content this year

235
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,680
[Music]

236
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
so it'll be good okay yeah

237
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,040
and then also we make it a free entry

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,920
because suppose i won't say okay i would

239
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
also like to

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
go to tokyo very much

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
yeah i'm sorry about it especially next

242
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
year

243
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
this is the first time i didn't

244
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,839
go to the def con this year i didn't

245
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,120
yeah i expected

246
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
so much but uh because the the the

247
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,959
coffee nighting

248
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,040
so we can yeah yeah what do you think

249
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
but that's an interesting thing about

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
defcon actually um

251
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
defcon moved to discord this year uh for

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
the platform

253
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
and i was actually shocked at how well

254
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,079
that worked

255
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
um there were hundreds and hundreds of

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
channels for all the villages and

257
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
everything and scrolling through those

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
channels i remarked to

259
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
to dark tangents going through those

260
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,079
channels felt

261
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
very very similar to walking through the

262
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
hallways

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
of the hotel

264
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,720
so it it it kind of uh got close to

265
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
capturing some sort of an

266
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,439
in-person feel um

267
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
which is interesting and made certain

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
things easier in organizing

269
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
an event like defcon ctf

270
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
okay also uh well from the incentive for

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
for speakers maybe we do not have

272
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,040
chances

273
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,079
to travel to different countries but i

274
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,560
think

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
if we have this event online maybe we

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
can increase the capacity of this event

277
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,079
so

278
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,640
do you have any observations on maybe

279
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
the number of

280
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
uh issues or number of speakers

281
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,880
increased

282
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,640
due in the event you organized

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,280
that will be the question 5.

284
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,010
[Laughter]

285
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
what was the question about no increase

286
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,160
attending

287
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
no yeah

288
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
we could but yeah we could but uh

289
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
if if i can answer i we could

290
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
have the more sessions more tracks

291
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
because it's virtual no limitation of

292
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,399
the spaces but

293
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,480
um but i think of the qualities

294
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
too so yeah yeah i think

295
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
a potential win is like streaming out

296
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
onto twitch and so forth

297
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
um or other streaming platforms but

298
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
yeah it triggers i think this um

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
you know going to the event is a very

300
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,000
big draw

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,120
right yeah

302
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
right that's right

303
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
okay so we can move to the next question

304
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,839
so

305
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,200
um we would like to ask kim kanna and

306
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,399
especially yan

307
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
about the contest of angnai

308
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
so so what is the difference

309
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
do you think that the country has moved

310
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,560
from

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
anxiety to online so what will be the

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,000
biggest

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
change or impact to the players could

314
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
you please share your experience with us

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
so maybe we can start from sure

316
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
me you

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
what is the difference between the uh

318
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
previous

319
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,399
contest and the virtual native is that

320
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
right

321
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
okay okay i have i think that uh there

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,920
are

323
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
two advantages and two drawbacks i think

324
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,440
so

325
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
okay uh advantages uh

326
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
the first one is that syria

327
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
is a team sports team competition

328
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
so for the students there is a big

329
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,320
burden because all team members should

330
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
move from south korea to the las vegas

331
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,399
or the

332
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
other foreign countries so we should

333
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,320
make

334
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
money for the flight fee and to

335
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
accommodations

336
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,199
but in in virtual cdf there is no that

337
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
type of burdens

338
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
so i think that is

339
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,199
that expensive so virtual cdf is very

340
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,600
good for the experience

341
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
for the employer students the second one

342
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,160
second thing is i think that uh in the

343
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,519
in case of the previous real city

344
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
it is very hard to communicate among

345
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
team members

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
because there are so big noise and music

347
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,600
in the field but but in virtual city

348
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
there are there though that kind of

349
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,880
noise

350
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
so it is very easy to communicate with

351
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
our team members

352
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,760
yeah so i think that that is the

353
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
advantages two advantages but

354
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
there are also drawbacks the first one

355
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
is that

356
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,880
uh from the view of the organizers

357
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,639
there is a problem of how to prevent

358
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
cheating and how to manage the huge

359
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,320
number of

360
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,760
uh vpn traffics so

361
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,600
that is uh drawbacks

362
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,959
from the perspective of the

363
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
organizations organizers and

364
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
the second drawback is that i think that

365
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,279
uh most of

366
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,560
our ctf team members our students think

367
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,360
that

368
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,839
i can i cannot feel like the real finals

369
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,160
yeah

370
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
it's just a virtual one so there is a

371
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
this disadvantage that the uh fun and

372
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
motivation

373
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
to participate the cdf are

374
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,959
very low compared to the real stadium

375
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,079
i think so yeah i i i

376
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
definitely felt that from the organizer

377
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,079
side of things absolutely

378
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,680
um when uh we organized our first defcon

379
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
ctf we had a player

380
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
um on ppp that

381
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,839
uh hacked so hard

382
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,199
that they passed out at the table right

383
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,759
and that's just much harder to not that

384
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
that's a good thing

385
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,440
hopefully luckily we haven't had any

386
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
other uh

387
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,079
medical emergencies at uh defcon ctf um

388
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,440
since but it's

389
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
not as it just shows how how motivating

390
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,600
being

391
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
there at the table in person can be um

392
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
and i've heard from many people that

393
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,480
it's

394
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
it's much harder to capture that but

395
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
like like you just said right um

396
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,440
if you're virtual um

397
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
[Applause]

398
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,920
another uh unexpected bonus one thing

399
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
that is very hard for us as organizers

400
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,880
every year

401
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,160
um as uh

402
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
you know with defcon being such a public

403
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
event is engaging with the audience

404
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
because usually we're way too busy to

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
you know let's say we

406
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,839
we could have a talk at def con but then

407
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,880
you'd have to

408
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,439
leave um the ctf area to go to a room

409
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
to talk to people right and that's just

410
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
we can't devote the time to that um

411
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,359
and it's hard to know you know there

412
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
will be an emergency at the time

413
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
um and we'll have to cancel it and so

414
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,720
forth but what we did

415
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
this year um because it was virtual

416
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,160
was um have um public

417
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,839
ctf um kind of

418
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
uh report like whatever a state of the

419
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
ctf report every day

420
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,919
um during defcon open to the public we

421
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
didn't a specific discord channel that

422
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,760
anyone could jump into and we

423
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,360
streamed it onto twitch and the public

424
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,559
engaged with that in a way that uh

425
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
we haven't seen you know spectators

426
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
directly engage

427
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
with um the the ctf finals in a long

428
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
time

429
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
um so that was that was a definite uh

430
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
opportunity i think that that we were

431
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,280
able to take advantage of

432
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,600
and help me the

433
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,720
kim said young said everything okay

434
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
okay especially the organizer side it's

435
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,799
hard

436
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,480
you know player side there is online

437
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
they have experiences but the organizing

438
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
the ctf

439
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,160
is you know organized ctf everybody's

440
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,960
different

441
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,120
rooms or different places it's a little

442
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,240
bit hard

443
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
yeah and i think uh

444
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
for especially in that sense uh because

445
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
organize when you organize like the run

446
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,120
up to the event is just

447
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
insane there's always an enormous thing

448
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,320
to be done

449
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
uh enormous amount of things to be done

450
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,919
that that

451
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
end up piling up and you don't sleep the

452
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
the last couple of days and so forth

453
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
and it's not so bad when um

454
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
everyone is in person and you can go and

455
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
wake someone up if there's a

456
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,440
you know if you need to launch their

457
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
challenge okay but at defcon

458
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
we were going to launch a challenge and

459
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,799
we uh

460
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,799
uh the person who wrote that challenge

461
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,240
was asleep

462
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
and we couldn't wake them up like maybe

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,679
calling

464
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,320
texting messaging everything they're

465
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
sleeping with with their phone

466
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,640
on silent by accident it's not only

467
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
about cta but the conference speakers

468
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:20,880
too

469
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
you know speaker in a different

470
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,240
different time zone

471
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,080
or drunk and you know i i always use a

472
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
hotel

473
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
close to that you know venue because i

474
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,559
can knock on the door and wake them up

475
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,120
but

476
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
this time no way it's it's going to be

477
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,320
accident

478
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
i mean okay yeah one time i think the

479
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
first time i spoke

480
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,679
at at uh hitcon i flew in uh my flight

481
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,039
got delayed and landed like an

482
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,480
hour before the uh the talk right and

483
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,880
and

484
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
i remember everyone was very very

485
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,559
stressed and rightfully so yeah

486
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,960
um and but it's like that but for

487
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
everybody

488
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
right you don't know who will be there

489
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
who won't yeah yeah okay

490
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
yes also also in case of the defcon

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,880
in my case i should wake up all day long

492
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
in the night i should participate in a

493
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
defcon in blackhead

494
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
and in in the morning and afternoon i

495
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
should go to my school to work

496
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,240
i should wake up all day long it's a

497
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,840
very hard job

498
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760
for me and also to my students yeah yeah

499
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
it's crazy okay jen uh

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
kim just mentioned about the cheating uh

501
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,600
i want to know what do you think what

502
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
kind of the cheating will be

503
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,640
if the the challenge the

504
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,320
the cdf is hold online

505
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,559
uh so there is uh

506
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,360
one difference one major difference um

507
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
from the perspective of cheating and

508
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,760
that is

509
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,720
when we hold defcon in person um

510
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,559
everyone gets a network table

511
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,840
and every packet that goes through our

512
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,240
um

513
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
network more or less we can tell what

514
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
team it's coming from

515
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,600
when things are held virtually for the

516
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
most part

517
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
you can but for example during the game

518
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
there was a brief period where someone's

519
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,400
uh

520
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,280
we gave each team a virtual machine um

521
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
that was pre-connected to the network

522
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,440
uh with with all the vpn configuration

523
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,520
done for them and someone's machine got

524
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,159
uh ddosed right or at least went down

525
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,280
several times

526
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
um and it's since it's all on the open

527
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,440
internet it's much harder to understand

528
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
who is doing what right you can you know

529
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,159
check okay what ips is this coming from

530
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:40,640
but

531
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
uh realistically that could still be

532
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,520
anybody right it's ipnip and

533
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,080
you know the western united states

534
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
probably an amazon

535
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,200
uh server that anyone could just spin up

536
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,640
um so from that perspective um network

537
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,159
dos and and uh it was

538
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,880
a little more chaotic i think otherwise

539
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,559
the ctf community has gotten

540
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,080
um quite good about

541
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,120
um not cheating or at least you know uh

542
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
figuring out ways to to stop

543
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,760
cheating um there are ctfs online cts

544
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,559
where

545
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,799
every for example hackasat every flag

546
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
was customized to the specific team that

547
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,559
was trying to solve the challenge

548
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
so flag sharing they could catch that

549
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
way um

550
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
and then a couple other things i don't

551
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,159
think it's that big a problem

552
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,120
uh for but of course you can't limit

553
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
team size anymore

554
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,440
if you wanted to in the first place yeah

555
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
yeah that would be the the third

556
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,559
question

557
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,120
uh jen and kim one of you is the

558
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,559
organizer

559
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,360
the other one was the was once the

560
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,159
champion

561
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
kim uh we

562
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,480
uh what do you think uh

563
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
of the china team winning the contest

564
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,360
this year

565
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,280
they are they are the first players

566
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
right yeah

567
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
yeah a a0e won first place um

568
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
in an incredibly tight battle um against

569
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,039
ppp right

570
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,679
up until the very end i mean they were

571
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
switching positions

572
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
so frequently it was insane to watch um

573
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,360
i uh way back when when

574
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
when oops one of the teams that later

575
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
became part of

576
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
uh azeri um was first starting out i

577
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,440
went

578
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,279
and um to to octf

579
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,240
and gave a talk uh the the whatever

580
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
opening ceremonies and i

581
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,919
in the opening ceremonies i said you

582
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,520
know packets

583
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,279
don't care about national boundaries

584
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,640
they're all hackers

585
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
and this isn't you know it's not

586
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,679
chinese hackers uh american hackers

587
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,120
taiwanese hackers japanese hackers it's

588
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
hackers right uh if you get a bunch of

589
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,720
everybody

590
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
in a room for example at the after

591
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
parties at def con ctf

592
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,159
everyone is just hanging out there

593
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,240
aren't like these clumps of countries

594
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,440
and so forth so

595
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
from that perspective i'm very

596
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
passionate about um

597
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
continuing to ensure that defcon ctf

598
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,039
represents

599
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
a global hacking community um

600
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
that's why i try to um argue

601
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,679
internally and and and we as a team try

602
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,880
to ensure that

603
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
the qualifying events um you know spread

604
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,960
out no

605
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
uh uh individual like hacking community

606
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
of one single

607
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
uh locality gets too much um you know

608
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,240
all

609
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
like all of the pre-qualifiers or

610
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,279
something

611
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,440
um so it was very awesome to see

612
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,200
um kind of uh more diversity among

613
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
the winners that was uh very cool i i i

614
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,799
respect

615
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
of course everyone at the top of that

616
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
scoreboard is incredible

617
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
um but you know

618
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,400
the more as we go back

619
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
in in time the more we say okay

620
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,240
uh this country this country this

621
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,159
country this country rather than saying

622
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,960
you know one this the same uh country

623
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,320
over and over that i think

624
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
is valuable for the um

625
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,279
global cyber security community one one

626
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,480
day we'll see

627
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,679
taiwan at the top there thank you

628
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,919
kim what do you think uh i think the aoe

629
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
their sponsors

630
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,720
they have a lot of sponsor so they

631
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,760
they so they have the 14

632
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,039
14 together so what do you think you are

633
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,760
the

634
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,120
you you took the two champion uh

635
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
i remember it's a 2015

636
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,279
and uh 2018 right

637
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,279
yes that's right okay okay what do you

638
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,799
think the china team winning

639
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
this this this year yeah i think that

640
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,360
uh whenever uh as you know well i'm i'm

641
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,159
i am a

642
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,960
libya board member of the bracket asia

643
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,760
so

644
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,720
whenever i leave you the submissions in

645
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,080
black hat

646
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
i always think i always feel that

647
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
the quality of the submissions from

648
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,279
china

649
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
is very high and the subject of the

650
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
submissions

651
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,000
are also very diverse and also

652
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,360
the chinese team tends to

653
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,559
be very persistent in conducting the

654
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,159
research once they started

655
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,000
so i think that this is possible because

656
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
there are a huge number of the people

657
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,120
and

658
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,159
there are so big budgets

659
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,640
for supporting that i think that

660
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
cdf is same as the

661
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
uh as the case of the breaking sessions

662
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,320
i think so

663
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
okay okay what do you think

664
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
professor wu yeah i i think

665
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,480
that um such a nice city of game

666
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,679
is just uh like you listen

667
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,760
to the radio the music right

668
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,640
it's not so exciting so but you but if

669
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
you listen to the music you just say oh

670
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,679
this is a very lovely song

671
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,720
from china from korea

672
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,760
from japan but if you want to

673
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,039
say who is the most

674
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,679
famous singer or the most outstanding

675
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,559
singer

676
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,159
in such cases that you can recognize

677
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,520
who is who so i think

678
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,840
actually i i encourage our students to

679
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
participate not

680
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
just alongside the game not just

681
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,159
on the future because on the future is a

682
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,000
just a mutual world there are so many

683
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you know so many skills that you can

684
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
cheat or you

685
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,720
you can uh get a lot of

686
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
people a lot of students just for a

687
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,919
supporting team

688
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,360
not in the real side actually a

689
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,559
real side competition has a very good

690
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,520
important uh value that is the social

691
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,279
coherence

692
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,919
social coherence that means that you you

693
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,120
can

694
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,320
participate such game such prayers with

695
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
the outcome from the other countries

696
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,120
to make good friends cyber security is

697
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,760
not just a problem from one country

698
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
cyber security is all over the world

699
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
right so we

700
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
need to uh have a good friends good

701
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,279
partners and social coherence

702
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,799
to just to against or such uh security

703
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,399
or cyber security

704
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,840
uh stress in the world so and actually i

705
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
yeah actually i i love and i encourage

706
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
my students to encourage just alongside

707
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,159
players

708
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,760
okay thank you thank you it's it's a

709
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
i think that's a very important thing

710
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
that is missing and that we haven't

711
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
figured out how to

712
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,000
um duplicate for

713
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,320
these high-level you know finals

714
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,440
in-person events

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,039
um i don't think anyone

716
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
from the u.s got you know

717
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,520
became friends with anyone from outside

718
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,159
the u.s

719
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
just from defcon finals whereas from

720
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,559
previous ones that was happening

721
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,640
you know but with them going virtual is

722
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,320
much harder

723
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
thank you thank you so so i think the

724
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,240
conclusion for this problem will be that

725
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
the party is the most important part of

726
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,430
the city of competitions

727
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,080
[Laughter]

728
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,760
absolutely yeah okay but in terms of the

729
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
effort you

730
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
you have to organize the event do you

731
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
think um

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
you will prefer to have an online event

733
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,060
next year or

734
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,399
[Music]

735
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,559
outside events do we have choices

736
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,520
well we're not sure but maybe we do not

737
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
have choices but if we have chances to

738
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,159
make a decision so what will be your

739
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,640
preference

740
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,120
on-site in person it'll be

741
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
it'll be awesome it's more work um

742
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,440
or at least different work but it it

743
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,159
it it's worth it it's worth it for the

744
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,600
community

745
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,240
you have the after party i have a life

746
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,799
to outside

747
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,200
after party after party

748
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
okay so maybe we can looking forward for

749
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,799
the vaccine next year so

750
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,679

751
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,960
board for

752
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,600
anxiety events okay well for me the

753
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,159
first time

754
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,960
see the cdf party after the cdf is in

755
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,559
korea

756
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,519
i think a long time ago and i saw it and

757
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,799
then

758
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,840
players don't talk much before ctf

759
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,320
but they talk each other how do you

760
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
solve it how do you solve it i

761
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
in the after party so that that was that

762
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,000
was the moment i

763
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
oh my god this is cool you know this is

764
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
how we meet the people

765
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
these kind of talented students don't

766
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,279
talk much they don't have you know

767
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,000
they're shy but uh after the city of

768
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
they talk a lot

769
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,480
even you know they who who's afraid of

770
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
speaking english

771
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,399
they speak and they see they show the

772
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,399
screen and this is how i do it or

773
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,200
something like that

774
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
so oh that was amazing i learned from

775
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
korean cydia

776
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,480
thank you thank you for it thank you

777
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
okay so i think we can move to the next

778
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,000
question

779
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,559
so uh for the next problem i would like

780
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,200
to ask

781
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,919
professor u and yang so i believe that

782
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,279
you already have a lot

783
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,480
of experiences on online courses

784
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,679
so um do you think the kobe 19 bring

785
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,679
any opportunities or challenges to

786
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,240
cyber security education online so maybe

787
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,960
you can share

788
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
the experiences with us

789
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,799
yeah actually i did not have so much

790
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,799
experiences

791
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,240
in online teaching uh i

792
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
uh i i do not like to online teaching

793
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
because uh when you are teaching in the

794
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,640
class

795
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,519
you can watch the you know you can watch

796
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,000
and

797
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,440
you you watch the looks and

798
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,799
some feelings from students and

799
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,000
what paley are uh want to or they are

800
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
looking forward to

801
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,039
what you have told them and so i think

802
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,799
that that is the

803
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,640
that's why we we need to have a

804
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
classroom not have a tv

805
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,360
in the classroom right we need classroom

806
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,000
we need

807
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
such climate uh for education

808
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,039
so uh actually i i

809
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,240
i do not accept or not teaching in my

810
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,320
university

811
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
yeah can you sorry uh i have saw a

812
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,679
video that uh when the teacher

813
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,279
they are teaching online as a student

814
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,880
used a video on the

815
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
handset and the fix on the

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
cam before the camera so the the teacher

817
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,320
thought they are still uh

818
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,960
there are so many problems uh in

819
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
classroom

820
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,279
for example and uh you know as

821
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,159
teachers say teachers say that they may

822
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,519
be violated their

823
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,080
freedom of teaching you know but what it

824
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,559
means

825
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,880
freedom of teaching because i want to

826
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,840
teach

827
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,120
and i want to depend on the feeling the

828
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,600
climate in the classroom

829
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,799
not just listen to the radio okay

830
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,399
we're not just watching the video online

831
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,320
i think that's a different climate for

832
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
learning

833
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,918
so then when we are learning for

834
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,079
enjoying learning for enjoying the means

835
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,119
you just involved in

836
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,320
such climate so that if you have a

837
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,440
happy learning not just learning for

838
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,560
application because

839
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,480
you need credits you know so i like that

840
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,399
that's uh in the last semester i

841
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,480
i cannot i refuse to uh teach online

842
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,320
yeah i insist so every student

843
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,520
they wear masks in my classroom and it

844
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,719
is very hard for me

845
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,159
to talk uh more than two hours

846
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,440
wearing masks but i enjoy i

847
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,400
just looking for their eyes not for the

848
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,520
full feelings

849
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,560
you know not just that they are facing

850
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,760
in in the students but i enjoy a lot of

851
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,800
climate

852
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,760
yeah so that's one opinion so but how

853
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,280
about young so you have wrong

854
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,839
pankaj for maybe more than one year so

855
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,480
yeah let me start with

856
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,200
yeah can you can you hear me yes we can

857
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,839
hear you

858
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,839
perfect awesome let me start with a kind

859
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,040
of an analogy

860
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
um when ebooks came out

861
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,160
right and people started reading on

862
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,599
their screens

863
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,800
um there are there were a lot of people

864
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
and there still are people that say okay

865
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,839
but i

866
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,480
that paper book the the sensation of

867
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
turning pages

868
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
the way that the light doesn't light up

869
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,880
in my face but

870
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,359
uh it reflects off the book that's an

871
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,359
integral part of reading

872
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,280
right um and there that is true for a

873
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
lot of people and

874
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,599
and um you know no physical books

875
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,000
uh are there for them but for many other

876
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
people

877
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,400
for a huge amount of

878
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
um avid readers the

879
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
uh ebooks are a great solution and they

880
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,560
enable access to incredibly wide ranges

881
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
of reading material

882
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,800
right imagine covid without ebooks

883
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,680
um i mean i have you know books in my

884
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,119
house but i would quickly

885
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,960
uh run out in a similar way

886
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,240
um i i had this

887
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,599
the same kind of um concerns

888
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,800
as as as professor wu uh as well

889
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
um i i was worried that

890
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,599
i i i build off of my students energy a

891
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,560
lot

892
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
i try to have a teaching style that's

893
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,160
very dynamic very

894
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,480
excited but it's very hard when there's

895
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,200
no one sharing that excitement

896
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
and i didn't know how i would move that

897
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,920
online so that was

898
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
one thing that i would say a second

899
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,079
thing i would say is um

900
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,680
the best way to run a ctf for example is

901
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,040
to run a ctf

902
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,359
if you if you don't have the ctf

903
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,960
deadline coming at you

904
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,119
you will never be ready to run a ctf

905
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
right but you know as the ctf gets

906
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:15,760
closer

907
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,320
you realize okay you have no choice but

908
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,960
to

909
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
put in insane amounts of work and get it

910
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
finished and and kova did something

911
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,839
similar

912
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,520
for me for online uh teaching um

913
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,640
when covet hit and it hit um arizona

914
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,240
very very hard uh maybe

915
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
a month or two ago right we had a huge

916
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,680
explosion and

917
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,280
um asu just said look

918
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,359
most classes are going to be online and

919
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,960
and we need to prepare so we have no

920
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,599
choice

921
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,520
and so then you sit down and you think

922
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
okay how can i make this work and i had

923
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
already launched

924
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,720
phone college one year ago at hitcon and

925
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,599
pawn college

926
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,040
is what i was calling a white belt

927
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,040
to yellow belt cyber security education

928
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,680
platform

929
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,839
you start phone college knowing nothing

930
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,119
about security but

931
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,000
good fundamental concepts um maybe

932
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,640
ideally you know x86 assembly just not

933
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,359
you know how to inject it into processes

934
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:13,839
and then

935
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,839
by the time you're you're through uh

936
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,880
phone college

937
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,079
you um now know

938
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,839
uh a lot of the basic concepts

939
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,079
of of hacking you know you understand

940
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,200
memory corruption you can reverse

941
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,480
engineer binaries

942
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
you understand how kernel

943
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,599
vulnerabilities arise and how kernel

944
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,720
exploitation works

945
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
these sort of things and i put the

946
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
challenge problems and my lecture slides

947
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
and i launched them publicly for the

948
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
internet last year and a lot of people

949
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:42,960
went and and

950
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,440
um phone colleges is based on this

951
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,200
concept of practice makes perfect there

952
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,520
are

953
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,400
literally hundreds of challenge problems

954
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
um for a student to do

955
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,560
start to finish um and they they get

956
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
slowly harder and a lot of the challenge

957
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,079
problems um

958
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,160
actually teach the students how to

959
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
complete them um

960
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,880
and and so forth and then um

961
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,359
my goal was always to launch videos

962
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,960
right because the lecture slides that

963
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,599
they're just

964
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,079
not good on their own right you need a

965
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,800
teacher to

966
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
to to teach um otherwise

967
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,760
we'd all be out of jobs at least in

968
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
academia and we'd just have lecture

969
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,560
slides everywhere right

970
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
be replaced by google spreadsheets or

971
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,200
google slides um and so

972
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,240
um what ended up uh happening

973
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,880
is i was just too busy to record those

974
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,720
videos and i was thinking okay i will

975
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,839
record them

976
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,040
and launch phone college uh videos

977
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,280
um you know the the home college 1.0

978
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,680
um you know right before defcon and that

979
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,040
of course didn't happen because we were

980
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,599
preparing

981
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
defcon and then but you know and and

982
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,359
what finally forced me to create

983
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,880
videos on phone college was having

984
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
to move my class online and i realized

985
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,800
okay my class is going to be online

986
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,960
anyways i will make home college

987
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,079
and my class the same thing so

988
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,440
i uh as as the semester progresses

989
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,040
i launch more and more videos and i

990
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,640
record them um

991
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
not in one long lecture because that's

992
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
impossible to maintain the energy

993
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
without the presence of students

994
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,280
i um record them in a

995
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,359
tiny conceptual part so i split my

996
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,480
lectures out

997
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
um i've gotten better at this throughout

998
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,240
the semester uh

999
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,079
for example last week we covered

1000
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,400
sandboxing and sandbox escape

1001
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
and every video is like 15 minutes long

1002
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,400
and i can sit down and i can maintain

1003
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,240
enthusiasm and excitement for the whole

1004
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,880
video

1005
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,040
and a student can sit down and watch it

1006
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
and absorb those

1007
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,599
um uh concepts while they you know

1008
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,960
go on with their day and then go and

1009
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,200
watch the next 15 minute video

1010
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,960
um and then the other thing that i do

1011
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,240
with student engagement is i stream

1012
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,200
live on twitch my office hours for the

1013
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
whole world to join

1014
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
and my um uh

1015
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
instead of like a normally scheduled

1016
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
lecture because everything is recorded

1017
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,520
and

1018
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
and and put online ahead of time i run

1019
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
an extended question and answer and demo

1020
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,520
session

1021
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
also live on twitch and so a lot of my

1022
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
students they show up on twitch and and

1023
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,000
on twitch

1024
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
it's a different kind of feedback but

1025
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,359
there is feedback there's the twitch

1026
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,160
chat

1027
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,560
that goes next to your video and

1028
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,280
students can

1029
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,440
can chat and and um you know post memes

1030
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,599
and there's all it's a very different

1031
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,200
type of classroom environment but it is

1032
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,480
a classroom environment

1033
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,280
it's just happening online and you can

1034
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,200
see that in real time and you can just

1035
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,400
you know take questions and so forth

1036
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,440
and it works um

1037
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
and then the awesome thing is all of

1038
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,359
this is also recorded so

1039
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,200
if you go to pond.college you're now

1040
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,960
launching videos every week we launch a

1041
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,359
new

1042
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,480
module of videos um and and

1043
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,839
it's uh alongside those videos on our

1044
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,079
youtube channel we have the extended q a

1045
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,079
and then the the office hours and so

1046
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,280
forth um

1047
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
i think it's working for students they

1048
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,400
can go back they can watch these

1049
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,280
concepts

1050
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,880
um during the the um lecture they can

1051
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,680
you know interact with the lecturer in

1052
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,520
funny ways on twitch

1053
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,800
um it's definitely not the same

1054
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,720
it's definitely very very different in

1055
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,560
experience but it

1056
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
it is the virtual equivalent

1057
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,480
of a classroom that i think works fairly

1058
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,280
well and

1059
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,319
there's one more thing um the big

1060
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,599
big challenge is um group activities

1061
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,280
right so i wanted this year at the end

1062
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,119
of every class i wanted one hour

1063
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,800
where the students could work together

1064
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
on challenge problems right like a mini

1065
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,240
ctf and maybe

1066
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,359
they'll team up into groups and then uh

1067
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,960
naturally they'll start racing each

1068
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,480
other for example or something along

1069
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,520
these lines

1070
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,640
um and that's very hard to do online

1071
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,200
but again after defcon moved to discord

1072
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,240
and i saw that

1073
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,560
maybe there's something to this i

1074
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,839
created a discord

1075
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,880
server for the whole class and so for

1076
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,280
one hour everyone passes into discord

1077
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
and they're all on different voice

1078
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,640
channels talking about

1079
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
you know how they're solving these

1080
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,000
problems and so forth and it

1081
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,280
it works it's uh last week for

1082
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
uh when we launched or last week two two

1083
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,640
days ago when we launched the shell

1084
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,079
coding challenges the shell coding

1085
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,880
module

1086
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,160
we i saw two students racing each other

1087
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,040
to the top

1088
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,119
um during that hour they managed to

1089
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,200
solve every challenge be released

1090
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,200
um we had to release more challenges

1091
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,680
so it it it works it's a very different

1092
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,880
online experience

1093
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,800
um it's a very different educational

1094
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
experiment the experience but

1095
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,119
so far i think the

1096
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,040
uh uh m the the content is making a good

1097
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,800
transition

1098
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,480
that's very good sharing thank you

1099
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,880
i believe that maybe it doesn't matter

1100
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,119
if we have a crosses online wrong side

1101
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,880
but it depends on the attitude of

1102
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
students so maybe we know that there are

1103
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,800
some data and driven students so

1104
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
even if you have many videos online and

1105
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,359
where they they do not pay for more time

1106
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,240
to

1107
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,359
looking for a video so and and

1108
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,640
some um some readers

1109
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,880
still don't want to read on on an ebook

1110
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,200
or can't and they just they just don't

1111
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,119
relate to that as well as paper books

1112
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,720
and i don't think we'll get rid of

1113
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,640
in-person schooling i mean once the the

1114
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,520
virus

1115
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,680
is uh dealt with but um

1116
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
i think this sort of education model is

1117
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
here to stay the other nice thing is

1118
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
once it happens like i'm recording all

1119
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,880
these videos

1120
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,359
uh those concepts stay relevant for a

1121
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,480
while not forever

1122
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,240
i'll have to re-record them in in a

1123
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,760
couple of years for example

1124
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,240
especially things like heap exploitation

1125
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
changes constantly

1126
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,200
um but the videos that are

1127
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,480
up on youtube they're they're they're

1128
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,200
there

1129
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,520
for people to learn even when i'm not

1130
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,119
teaching which is a very

1131
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,960
um exciting thing as an educator

1132
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
okay thank you for your sharing i think

1133
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,040
we have one best question so

1134
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
okay uh i would like to ask of you

1135
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
uh the blackhead this time has held

1136
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,000
virtually

1137
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
as the organizer do you think we have

1138
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,200
any way to increasing their audience

1139
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,960
also okay just for the first question

1140
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,560
uh how anyway we can increasing

1141
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,480
the increase the audience

1142
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,620
[Music]

1143
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,040
uh connor can you take uh take it

1144
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,119
first sure um

1145
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,400
actually it is increased maybe because

1146
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:54,800
uh

1147
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,560
um we make it the free entry

1148
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,319
prior strength maybe because of it but

1149
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,520
we don't show the program list yet we

1150
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:05,920
don't

1151
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,760
you know publish the speaker list yet

1152
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,119
but we have

1153
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,960
more than 1500 registrations

1154
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,119
already so it shows

1155
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,160
uh how you know how much they are

1156
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,960
expecting

1157
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,079
you know the cold blue some people

1158
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,200
cannot you know take

1159
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,839
uh come to the cobra because of the or

1160
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,040
because of the

1161
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,640
uh i don't know distance uh

1162
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,680
time but they can you know listen to the

1163
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,440
sessions

1164
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,480
okay from home yeah so it is increasing

1165
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:40,839
and

1166
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,400
interestingly i don't know female is

1167
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,960
small too

1168
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,200
online okay um

1169
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,920
not all the places but i see some you

1170
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,640
know differences

1171
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,880
like um for example

1172
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
like uh kodu is calling for the

1173
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,000
communities

1174
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,280
but the first submitter is the female

1175
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,720
and then she yeah that was a female

1176
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,079
community who

1177
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,440
wants to uh make more female speakers on

1178
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,800
stage

1179
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,920
so that that is good one and also the

1180
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,800
other one is that

1181
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,160
other events uh it's an educational

1182
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,640
one-year education project and then

1183
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,160
they're calling for the student

1184
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,280
and then more female is coming even

1185
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,079
though you know

1186
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,040
the the number of the some uh

1187
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,160
application

1188
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,040
was decreased not is was decreased but

1189
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,520
the

1190
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,839
percentage of the female is increased

1191
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,200
that's interesting

1192
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,559
okay thank you uh kim what do you think

1193
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,920
uh any way to increase the audience

1194
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,200
uh yeah uh

1195
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,319
in order to increase the audience i

1196
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,520
think that

1197
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,680
we should we should make

1198
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,480
some method to strengthen the

1199
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,079
relationship between people

1200
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,119
and people because many

1201
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,160
uh hacking people hacking students

1202
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
uh want to make some relationship

1203
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,040
with the great hackers in in hacking

1204
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,240
conferences

1205
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,160
so we should solve these problems

1206
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,800
uh in case of some universities and

1207
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,920
companies

1208
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,760
try various things like minecraft and so

1209
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,800
on

1210
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,000
so i think that we can

1211
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,920
try the uh virtual uh

1212
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,680
hacking uh conference in minecraft

1213
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,040
platforms in in in that

1214
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,480
platforms we can meet somebody

1215
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,000
some some some avatars in in minecraft

1216
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,119
and say something to them

1217
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,400
so i think that in the future we should

1218
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,559
make some a minecraft problem

1219
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,800
for open the uh hacking conferences i

1220
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,839
think so

1221
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,279
okay again

1222
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,119
yeah i think the um alternate

1223
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,440
routes of engagement are gonna be uh

1224
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,640
toyed around with

1225
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,240
um creating a vr platform for defcon ctf

1226
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,200
yeah

1227
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,559
right um but in the end it's it's

1228
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,319
just tough to guarantee that everyone

1229
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
has a vr headset but

1230
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,880
you could have you know um you know

1231
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,000
like a a headset that you put a phone in

1232
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,640
included

1233
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,640
in the admission cost for example that

1234
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,240
that could uh

1235
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
could work um i i think conus point

1236
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,720
is uh a very very important one um

1237
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,400
the numbers might be going down but the

1238
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,240
question is who is attending

1239
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,240
not just how many um if using a virtual

1240
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,680
setting where either um people that

1241
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,119
couldn't afford it

1242
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,040
or people that didn't feel comfortable

1243
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,319
showing up to an event

1244
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,880
right um

1245
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,520
unfortunately the cyber security

1246
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,240
community is is not uh

1247
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,280
so widely known for its inclusivity

1248
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,119
um and and this makes certain people um

1249
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,800
it makes it hard for certain people to

1250
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
participate if online makes that

1251
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,359
happen um that is a huge

1252
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,960
value to our community i think so thank

1253
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,359
you

1254
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,760
very ugly so this is something we need

1255
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,480
to investigate and actually amplify

1256
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,359
um even even postcoded that's true and

1257
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,240
also if

1258
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,640
we talking about the functions of the

1259
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,160
conference like a br or something like

1260
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,800
that

1261
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,520
i really like to have the automatic

1262
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,119
translations

1263
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,079
on chat you know young speak english and

1264
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,200
i speak japanese

1265
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,400
kimchi speak korean and then you guys

1266
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
you know taiwanese speak taiwanese

1267
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,839
on chat and it's all translation

1268
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,720
on each screen that's amazingly that's

1269
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,880
amazing i love to have

1270
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,520
one of the most surreal do we have these

1271
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,720
technologies

1272
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,240
right i i heard the phd is

1273
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,800
has such a things and it's under their

1274
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,839
development but

1275
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,319
if they provide freely that that is

1276
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,800
amazing

1277
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,200
yeah and also the uh you know old

1278
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,920
translation for speakers too

1279
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,319
we don't have to hire you know in i

1280
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,440
don't know

1281
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,800
expensive translators you know

1282
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,160
you know what it's not only japan but uh

1283
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,200
if we use their voices on

1284
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,200
youtube they charge us twice more

1285
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,040
wow yeah because that it's it's used

1286
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,079
no uh their voice is only for one time

1287
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,800
but if we use it for archive they charge

1288
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,079
us twice more so

1289
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,240
i really like to have the automatic

1290
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,800
translation

1291
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,920
on speakers and on chat one of the most

1292
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,760
surreal experiences i've had

1293
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,119
in my kind of professional life is um

1294
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,960
the panel last year at hitcon where

1295
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,599
everyone was speaking in their language

1296
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,839
and then you had live translators

1297
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,119
going in our ears that was incredible um

1298
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,359
yes yeah yeah right yeah

1299
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,520
yeah yeah but you know like kana said if

1300
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,559
you really

1301
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,240
enable that as using these online

1302
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,079
conferences as a seed

1303
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,599
yeah that is huge value yes so i think

1304
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,000
both in in in conferences and education

1305
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
um

1306
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,640
kovarez is a big bummer for sure

1307
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,400
um but we need to see it not just

1308
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,920
as a uh problem but as a catalyst for

1309
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,359
solutions

1310
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,440
right for for kind of the next steps in

1311
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,000
education people have been talking a lot

1312
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,680
that um the you know future of education

1313
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,960
of education doesn't include

1314
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
universities um

1315
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,520
i think i don't know whether it does or

1316
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,359
not but i think the future of education

1317
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,319
has to include

1318
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,119
a wide scale streaming archiving to uh

1319
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,880
permanent platforms

1320
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,960
and so forth um there's a lot of value

1321
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,880
in that that we shouldn't abandon

1322
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,960
just because we we get a vaccine in a

1323
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,040
couple months or whatnot

1324
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,480
okay the last question uh yen um

1325
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
what do you think the kobe 90 will be

1326
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,800
continue uh do we have the

1327
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,520
death cause cdf next year what do you

1328
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,800
think

1329
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,880
we will have defcon ctf next year and we

1330
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,800
will i mean everything

1331
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,839
i mean in person

1332
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,119
yeah uh but of course ultimately it is

1333
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,720
