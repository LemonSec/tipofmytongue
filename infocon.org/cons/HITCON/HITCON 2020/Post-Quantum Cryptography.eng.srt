2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,559
all right thank you

3
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,440
uh-oh are we on yeah thanks for the

4
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,359
introduction

5
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,199
cryptography is about people

6
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
communicating

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
we have names for these people imagine

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,840
one person

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
named alice sending a message to

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
another person named bob so here's

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,320
pictures of

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,479
alice and bob and they're communicating

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,280
through

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
the internet or through some network

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
they're very long distance away from

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
each other

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,119
and that makes a problem the problem is

18
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
that somebody's listening to the network

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,159
that's an eavesdropper and we have a

20
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,680
name for the eavesdropper the

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
eavesdropper there's alice and bob

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
communicating

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
the eavesdropper is someone named eve

24
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
here's a picture of eve

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
it's a great picture everybody one hand

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
on the laptop

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
one hand on the mouse

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,079
look at the camera look at the at the at

29
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
the screen and then everybody

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
okay so eve is listening to the

31
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,759
connection

32
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,040
and eve is maybe changing the data

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,160
changing the messages on the connection

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
so cryptography tries to protect against

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,920
this

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,120
and the way cryptography does this is

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
it writes messages in a secret language

38
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
cryptography means secret writing so

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
cryptography

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
changes the messages that we send in

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
some secret way

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,440
and then sends the modified messages

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
and then it's supposed to protect us

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
against the eavesdropper there are a few

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
different goals

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
for example confidentiality secrecy this

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,080
is saying

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,160
that eve cannot understand the messages

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
integrity and authenticity these say

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,760
that

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
if eve tries to change messages

52
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,239
or tries to pretend to be alice

53
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
then bob will figure that out

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
and we try in cryptography to make all

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,000
of these properties

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,879
confidentiality integrity authenticity

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
now you have encountered cryptography in

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
your daily life when you're visiting a

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,440
web page

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
assuming you're looking at the schedule

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,440
of vidcon you're going to an https page

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
and you can look

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,319
at what cryptography is secure in your

64
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
connection but it's not very friendly to

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,519
the user

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
because all you see there is three or

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
four or five letter abbreviations

68
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,280
and well here i've at least sorted those

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,879
into two different types so in

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
cryptography we have two types of

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,159
communication we have

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
cryptography with what we call symmetric

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
keys

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
if alice and bob have met each other

75
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
they know each other and they have a

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,640
shared secret

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
they can use some from this upper

78
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
category

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
and if they haven't met yet like you

80
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
visiting your web page you don't have

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
any secret information you share with

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,239
this webpage

83
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,760
so then you're using what is called

84
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
public key cryptography

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
and here are the names of the public key

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
crypto systems

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
these cryptographic systems are designed

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
so that

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
even if somebody tries to figure out the

90
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
secrets with a huge

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
computer this is a super computer in

92
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,399
china

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
publicly announced supercomputer in

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,680
china

95
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
the sunway taihoo light i guess if you

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
read the characters it says something

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
about divine power

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,479
and this is a very powerful computer but

99
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
even this computer cannot break

100
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,440
the cryptography that we're using today

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
well that is good for today there's one

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,479
problem

103
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
namely that in 1994 peter shaw found an

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,120
algorithm and this algorithm has one

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,840
requirement

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
it requires a sufficiently large quantum

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
computer this is a very very large

108
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,800
quantum computer

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
but given this quantum computer his

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
algorithm is able to break discrete

111
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
compute discrete logarithms and compute

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
factorizations

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
so factorizations is just the normal you

114
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
have a product of two integers

115
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
and it can break this into its two parts

116
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
or multiple parts

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
unfortunately these two problems are the

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,639
core

119
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
of what we see on the internet in this

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
category of public key crypto systems

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,400
so his 1994 algorithm is a real threat

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
to the cryptography on the internet to

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
the security

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,440
but this is only a threat if somebody

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,840
has

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
a quantum computer so do we have quantum

127
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
computers well

128
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,360
last year google proudly presented to

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,479
the world

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
a baby quantum computer okay they didn't

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
say it was a baby quantum computer

132
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
they said this is a powerful quantum

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
computer

134
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
this quantum computer has achieved

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
quantum supremacy this means

136
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,479
it does a calculation one special

137
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,919
calculation

138
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,039
faster than taihu

139
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,240
does the calculation this is

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
powerful for one calculation and this is

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,600
called

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
quantum supremacy

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
well but even though he looks very

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
friendly in this computer is like

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
nice colorful google colors i mean this

146
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
can't do anything evil right i mean it's

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
it's pretty red and blue

148
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,639
and the guy looks friendly however he's

149
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
pretty clear

150
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
about the impact on security the impact

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
on cryptography that this

152
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
research has maybe he is breaking a

153
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
little bit too much but he's saying

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
in a five to ten year time frame quantum

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,600
computing will break encryption

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
as we know it today

157
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
so that is a strong statement about

158
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
what these quantum computers will do in

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
a rather short time frame just five to

160
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
ten years

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,319
now what about other countries google is

162
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,560
building their computer in the u.s

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
so i looked around for trusted news from

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
other countries and i found a very

165
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,319
reputable news site from china called

166
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,560
globaltimes.cn

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
maybe you've seen it yourself and they

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
say that

169
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,199
chinese researchers are going to jump

170
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
ahead of google

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
of course this is what the chinese

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,639
government wants

173
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,039
everybody to know who knows what they're

174
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,240
doing secretly

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
but this is their public announcement

176
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
that china this was an announcement in

177
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,120
august

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
china is building a computer

179
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
that publicly is as good as google's

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,720
quantum computer what are they doing

181
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
secretly

182
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
who knows well so since we don't have

183
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,599
any pictures of that

184
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,759
uh let's put just the quantum symbol on

185
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
it it's like when you're pushing

186
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,120
purchasing something on the internet and

187
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,639
they tell you product details may differ

188
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
well this is our symbol image of a big

189
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,639
powerful quantum computer

190
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
that nobody is believed to have right

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,479
now but let's go back to the slide that

192
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,520
we had here

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,199
where i listed the different crypto

194
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
systems

195
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,319
so if eve changes and changes into eve

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,879
with a quantum computer

197
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,520
then everything in the bottom part

198
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,160
everything

199
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
under public key cryptography turns red

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,080
that means

201
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
it gets broken by shaw's attack

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,879
with a big powerful quantum computer

203
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
and what about these black things that

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
weren't broken well this is

205
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,039
symmetric key cryptography this was

206
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,080
again where the alice and bob

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,039
have met already and alice and bob are

208
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,440
sharing a secret key

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
and now cryptography can build

210
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,600
very easy solutions very easy ways to

211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
securely encrypt your data if you have

212
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
a very long shared secret and long means

213
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
as long as the messages that you're

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,519
sending so if you've met somebody alice

215
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,320
and bob meet

216
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,080
privately and then they flip some coins

217
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
make some random numbers and they

218
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
exchange many many

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
random numbers and then they can use

220
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,519
what's called the one

221
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
time pad and that will encrypt

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,279
all of their data in a way that the

223
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,000
attacker

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
cannot figure out what the message means

225
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
they can also protect integrity and

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
authenticity they can stop

227
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
forgeries it's a little more complicated

228
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
but it's called a wegman carter mac

229
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,040
and this is a mathematical computation

230
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
which protects the

231
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,440
integrity of your message nobody can

232
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,920
fool

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,560
bob into taking another message it's

234
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
only from alice

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
now what happens if you don't have a

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
long secret key

237
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
alice and bob meet for just a few

238
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
minutes

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,880
and then they don't have time to flip a

240
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,360
million

241
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
coins what they can do is use aes

242
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,959
aes is a standard way to take a

243
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,600
short secret key for example as256

244
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
takes 256 coin flips 256 bits

245
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
and as256 makes a big

246
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,200
long random string which is like it can

247
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,600
flip

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
a million coins for you a billion and

249
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,959
alice and bob

250
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
if they know the same 256 bits

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
they use aes and they get the same long

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
shared secret anybody else who doesn't

253
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
know the 256 bits

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
they have no idea what the aas output is

255
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
they could try guessing but it takes a

256
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
very long time to guess

257
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
256 bits now

258
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,760
the security of aes is something that

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
people have studied for 20 years

260
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
and it's fine aes 256

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
will never be broken even with a quantum

262
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
computer

263
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,720
if somebody has a quantum computer they

264
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,440
can use

265
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
grover's algorithm which will

266
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
make guessing faster but it still won't

267
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,120
break

268
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
aes 256. if you're really optimistic

269
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
about quantum computers as an attacker

270
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
maybe eve thinks that

271
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
grover's algorithm will break aes 256

272
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,640
in only 2 to the 128

273
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
operations but that's a very large

274
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
number of operations

275
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
if you're using aes 128

276
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,959
then grover's algorithm takes 2 to the

277
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,079
64

278
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,279
operations and maybe that's a problem

279
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,839
but if you use aes 256 you're fine

280
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,120
as-256 will never be broken

281
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
okay so how about this other part how

282
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
about the part

283
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
in public key cryptography where

284
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
the quantum computer will break

285
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
everything so there is an area of

286
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,200
research and that's what the topic of

287
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
this talk is

288
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
and that's called post quantum

289
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
cryptography so post quantum

290
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,839
cryptography is cryptography

291
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,000
under the assumption that the attacker

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
has a quantum computer

293
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,839
so just as in our picture where we have

294
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,480
alice

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
and bob communicating and in the middle

296
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,839
eve has now turned into quantum eve so

297
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,120
quantum eve

298
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,360
is the same if that would before still

299
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
has the same interest as the same

300
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
eavesdropping desires

301
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
but also has a quantum computer it

302
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
typically doesn't mean that alice and

303
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
bob have a quantum computer

304
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
for instance alice and bot are

305
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
communicating today eve is recording

306
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
messages for later to break then with a

307
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,079
quantum computer

308
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,360
that's one of the scenarios we're

309
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
looking into with postpartum

310
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,160
cryptography

311
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
so eve has a quantum computer alice and

312
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
bob do not

313
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
and so this research i already showed

314
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,720
you the 1994 paper from shore

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
then had mentioned a paper by love

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,000
grover

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
from 1996 so these are the

318
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,920
two most visible algorithms but there's

319
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
a whole area of research called

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
quantum algorithms or quantum computing

321
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
where they have developed many more

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,959
algorithms

323
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
and several of those have relevance to

324
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,639
cryptography so if you want to learn

325
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
more about quantum algorithms

326
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
there's a link called the quantum

327
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
algorithms

328
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
zoo so you can go there and click on

329
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
them and you'll find out that some of

330
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
the algorithms

331
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,959
are good for finding fertilizer or

332
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
medication or weather forecasts

333
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
but then there also are some definitely

334
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,680
go over and show but also cooper berg

335
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,399
and several variations of those quantum

336
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,360
walks and so on

337
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,519
which have effect on quantum sorry on

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,880
cryptography

339
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
now it's not all lost

340
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
i showed you what is currently used on

341
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,720
the internet and that all turned red

342
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
but there were some systems even before

343
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
these other ones came into into use they

344
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
just were not as popular

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
but shaw's paper kicked off interest in

346
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,160
figuring out

347
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
what systems could remain secure against

348
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
quantum computers

349
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
and so after like a few years

350
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,839
people were pointing out hey look um

351
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
here is something which we believe

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,079
is even hard for a quantum computer so

353
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
even if eve has a squad computer

354
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
and it's a big quan compute and so on

355
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
then eve can't do anything against these

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
particular systems

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
and so this this area needed a name and

358
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,199
dan here in 2003 wrote on a mailing list

359
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,480
how about we call this

360
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
post-quantum cryptography so it's

361
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,760
cryptography

362
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
foreign area past the advent of quantum

363
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,199
computers

364
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
but it just means that the attacker is a

365
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
quantum computer does not mean that the

366
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,440
user

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,760
has a quantum computer and while this

368
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,680
was catching up so within three years we

369
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,560
had the first

370
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,519
academic workshop 2006 was the first

371
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
international workshop on post quantum

372
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
cryptography and that kicked off a

373
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,519
longer series

374
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
of conferences called pikachu so if you

375
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
google on the internet you'll find

376
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,920
pikachu

377
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
2006 2008 they were going basically

378
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
every year and a half and you see on the

379
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
slides that the frequency has sped up a

380
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,440
little bit

381
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
and if this talk interest makes you

382
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
interested in this area

383
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
you're just in time to catch the 2020

384
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
edition in two weeks from now which will

385
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
be held

386
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
online because no other country other

387
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,399
than taiwan can actually have physical

388
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
workshops right now

389
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
and in taiwan you can still participate

390
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
in these workshops when they're online

391
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
also several standardization bodies have

392
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,519
caught up so nist is the national

393
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,240
institutes

394
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
for standards and technology that is a

395
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
body in the u.s

396
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
but it has turned whether by historical

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
accident or by pushing of certain

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,759
nations

399
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,839
it has turned into the de facto

400
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
standardization body

401
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
for cryptography so nist defines what

402
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,720
cryptography gets used

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,440
broadly and so in 2015 they hosted a

404
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
workshop to kind of figure out is there

405
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,720
enough interest

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
and okay the room wasn't nearly as big

407
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,839
as this room but if

408
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
it was like 120 people which was more

409
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
than their room could handle so they had

410
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,040
to close registration

411
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
and they had to stream some stuff so yep

412
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,199
they decided it's interesting

413
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,839
and uh announced the next year that

414
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
there would be a competition

415
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,199
and this competition has been running

416
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,040
for the last few years and has kept

417
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,720
many of us busy and den is going to show

418
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
a little bit of the details of that

419
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,759
all right so let's take a look at here's

420
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,120
the names

421
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,279
of the well it's gonna take a little bit

422
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,800
of time okay okay so

423
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
big quake this is a code-based crypto

424
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,000
system

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,040
and the authors were okay uh

426
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
i won't go through all of these but just

427
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
to give you the big idea

428
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
these are from 260 people

429
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
actually even more people submitted

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
when nist announced they're running a

431
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
competition

432
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,839
there were 82 submissions these are only

433
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,040
the 69

434
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
public submissions nist said these were

435
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,360
complete

436
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
proper submissions maybe the other 13

437
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
didn't include software or they made

438
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
some mistake they didn't follow the

439
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,600
rules

440
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,760
but these 69 submissions from 260 people

441
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,319
all of these followed the rules and they

442
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,679
posted all of these

443
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
and this was the 21st of december 2017.

444
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
now by the end of 2017

445
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,079
10 days later there were eight

446
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,599
submissions that had been

447
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,839
attacked oops oops yeah

448
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,200
there are some of these that are in red

449
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
and those are broken broken means

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,720
it's completely unsafe don't use it you

451
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
cannot use for example

452
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
hk17 and the ones that are

453
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
underlined in red which is all of these

454
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
red ones

455
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
those had python scripts which

456
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
showed here's how to break these

457
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
proposals

458
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
some of these were posted the same day

459
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,360
or within a few days

460
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
but all of this was within 10 days of

461
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,640
the

462
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
submissions being public the brown ones

463
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,280
those were not so serious attacks

464
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,559
it was maybe less security than they

465
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
said they should have but maybe still

466
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
okay

467
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
and then well by the end of 2018

468
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,559
one year later you see a lot more red

469
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
a lot more underlines okay rank sign

470
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
this was a serious attack but nobody

471
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
wrote a python script so no

472
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
underline more brown ones with

473
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
some loss of security and then

474
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
nist said okay okay we're going to focus

475
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
we're going to have a second round of

476
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,799
the competition

477
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,240
with the most interesting submissions

478
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
and so they crossed out many submissions

479
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,000
and they selected

480
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
26 candidates now some of these are

481
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
in blue and the blue ones are ones that

482
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,919
merged

483
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,280
for example n true hrss and n true

484
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,080
encrypt

485
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
those merged those turned into one

486
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,440
submission

487
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
they're very similar and they said we'll

488
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,559
just

489
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,799
join the teams and work together and

490
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,160
there were a few different

491
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
merges and then well more attacks

492
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
happened

493
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,480
there were eight more attacks well some

494
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,679
of these were agila

495
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,799
5 and lita these were if i go back these

496
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,679
were already in

497
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
in brown before but then there were

498
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
eight more

499
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
attacks some of them serious attacks and

500
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,799
then nist said in 2020

501
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,039
just in july they said okay we're going

502
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,320
to focus on

503
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
15 the the ones that we think are the

504
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
most

505
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
interesting and these are the 15

506
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,120
including some some merges so you see 17

507
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,600
names

508
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,720
listed and out of these some of them are

509
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
called finalists and nist is thinking

510
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
about standardizing those in

511
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
while starting in a year or two they'll

512
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
select something

513
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,799
and some of them are alternates where

514
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,919
they're saying

515
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,919
they'll select some of those maybe in

516
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,600
three or four years

517
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,480
okay and this is the current status of

518
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,200
the nist

519
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
competition

520
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
so you might not think that everything

521
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,360
is kind of okay this is doing something

522
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
and also when you look in other reports

523
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,280
so the national academy of sciences of

524
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,640
the united states

525
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
published a big report so they got

526
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
people together

527
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
several researchers invited i mean they

528
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
had several researchers on the board to

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
write this report

530
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
they invited some more for special

531
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
sessions so we ended up going there for

532
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,280
a session on

533
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
on post quantum cryptography on and on

534
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
the effects of

535
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
quantum computers on cryptography and

536
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,919
then

537
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,960
end of 2018 they published their report

538
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
including 10 key findings now the first

539
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,679
key finding

540
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
you might translate is don't panic

541
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
the first key finding was well maybe a

542
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
little bit contradicted by google and

543
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
maybe the chinese

544
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
but they were saying we do not expect

545
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400
that anything will happen in the next 10

546
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
years

547
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,520
that seriously threatens rsa 2048 so rsa

548
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
2048 is one of those

549
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,039
three-letter abbreviations that you saw

550
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,559
on the previous slides and it's a very

551
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,400
common system that you will find

552
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
when you click on the details in your

553
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
browser so if you're wondering what is

554
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
securing your connection to the internet

555
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
this is one of the typical ones

556
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
and this report with the basis of a lot

557
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
of researchers is saying

558
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
yeah probably nothing for the next 10

559
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,320
years

560
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,919
but that's just the first key finding

561
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,880
it goes up to key finding 10.

562
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,240
which i would say is more like panic

563
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,880
it ends with a nice words uh of saying

564
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,039
that deployment of postgrad cryptography

565
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,000
is critical

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
for minimizing the chance of of a

567
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
potential security and privacy

568
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
disaster these are academics writing

569
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,760
about

570
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,840
disaster so this is serious news this

571
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,880
really means

572
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,919
very do something and the main point

573
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
they highlight in this

574
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,559
key finding 10 is that it takes a long

575
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,600
time

576
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,799
to roll out and to deploy post quantum

577
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,559
cryptography

578
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,919
and so even though it's still 10 years

579
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,320
till quant computer that big that

580
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
threatening would be

581
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
existent it is high time to do something

582
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
here is another aspect that they don't

583
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
put into a key finding but they

584
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
highlight in section 4.4

585
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
namely the effects on long-term security

586
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,720
so

587
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,080
anything that you're sending today yes

588
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,159
we said even the most powerful computer

589
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,919
i mean the chinese one is only number

590
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,559
four

591
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
there are three more computers which are

592
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,559
more powerful but even those computers

593
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,960
cannot break our current cryptography

594
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
that we're using today

595
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
they might find other weaknesses

596
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,960
cryptography is often not the the

597
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,080
weakest part so i'm not saying that

598
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
everything on the internet is secure

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,320
but the cryptography is probably secure

600
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
against today's computers

601
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
however if an attacker is listening in

602
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,480
today

603
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
if they're recording the messages today

604
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,840
and

605
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
well your messages are going over the

606
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
internet so of course

607
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
they are public they get routed around

608
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,640
and we have seen for instance in the

609
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
snow and revelations

610
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,799
that the united states is very active in

611
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
recording the internet

612
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,080
i would be surprised if other

613
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
governments are not recording the

614
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
internet so you should assume that

615
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
everything you're sending today

616
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,480
is stored somewhere and even if it is

617
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,360
encrypted

618
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,679
well they can't read it today but they

619
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,720
might

620
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
store it and encrypt a decrypt later so

621
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,919
for future use that means once they have

622
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
a quantum computer they can go back

623
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,159
to today's messages anything that you

624
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,039
send today

625
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,200
which is still interesting in 10 years

626
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
when the attacker has a quantum computer

627
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
that is going to be lost and that's a

628
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
kind of strange time machine

629
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
because today you're feeling very sure

630
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
you're feeling secure when you're using

631
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,559
the internet

632
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,080
and we tell you yeah don't worry it's

633
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,720
secure the crypto is fine

634
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
but today's messages will become public

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,880
in 10 years and so it depends on what

636
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,919
the world is like

637
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
whether what you're sending today is

638
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,520
incriminating or not

639
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
let's look a little more at the other

640
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,799
issue the

641
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,360
timeline for deploying cryptography

642
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
there are many many steps that this

643
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
takes you might think it's very simple

644
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,559
like

645
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
we have some crypto system and we've

646
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,919
written down the crypto system and we

647
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,799
put it in the web browser and we're done

648
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,279
but

649
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
there are many many stages that we have

650
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
to do to make this work

651
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
let me start at the top at the top we

652
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
have to say

653
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,960
what are we trying to do for example

654
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,159
confidentiality we're trying to encrypt

655
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,200
data

656
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
and then you have to figure out some

657
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
mathematical transformation

658
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,720
some some crypto system which

659
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,120
achieves that goal which is able to

660
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
encrypt data

661
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
and then well maybe it's not secure so

662
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
you have to study algorithms

663
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,080
that the attackers might use you have to

664
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,799
think can

665
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,440
somebody break this using a big computer

666
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
maybe using a quantum computer in 10

667
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,200
years

668
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,880
and this you saw in the nist competition

669
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
there were attacks against proposals

670
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,559
from 2017

671
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
and there are attacks in 2018 and

672
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,320
attacks in 2019 and actually

673
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
there are even some new attacks now so

674
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,000
right now we're

675
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,120
at stage three we're studying algorithms

676
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,440
that the attackers can use

677
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
and we have to do this because we have

678
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
to throw away the broken systems

679
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,720
and only choose secure cryptosystems

680
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,760
that's stage four where maybe we're

681
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
getting to stage four but

682
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,880
we're not really there yet and even at

683
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,679
stage four

684
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,400
even if we have secure crypto systems

685
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
that's not the end

686
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,559
because we have to make these crypto

687
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,159
systems usable

688
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,440
people have to be able to use the secure

689
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,799
cryptosystems in

690
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,440
applications which first means we need

691
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
to have

692
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,440
algorithms which compute these

693
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,320
operations

694
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
the encryption or signatures whatever

695
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,559
operations we need to

696
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,840
have algorithms and software and maybe

697
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,640
hardware that's the next line here

698
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
we have to make that happen in a way

699
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,080
that people can use

700
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
and make it as fast as possible so that

701
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,880
nobody complains about the performance

702
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
and then you think okay now we can put

703
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
it in the browser but it's not that easy

704
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,760
because

705
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,799
the software is something that can be

706
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,360
broken

707
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
by timing attacks for example there are

708
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
always new announcements about

709
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
ooh the timing of some operation leaked

710
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,559
some secret data

711
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,799
and now the attacker knows your secret

712
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
key so

713
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,400
just the raccoon attack a few days ago

714
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
was a timing attack yeah

715
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
lots of these timing attacks breaking

716
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,120
everything

717
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
and so you need software and hardware

718
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
which does not leak information

719
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
through timing and through

720
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
electromagnetic radiation

721
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
and acoustic signals there's lots of

722
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,039
side channel attacks

723
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,360
it's not so easy to just implement an

724
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
algorithm securely

725
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,279
once you know what all the attacks are

726
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,279
then you can choose the

727
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,520
safe implementations the secure

728
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,799
implementations that

729
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
correctly compute the function that you

730
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
want to compute

731
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
and then maybe they're all too slow so

732
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,240
you have to

733
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,279
throw away algorithms again

734
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,159
and if it's fast enough and it's secure

735
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,600
software or hardware

736
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
for a secure crypto system then you can

737
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
put it into the

738
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,120
user application which maybe the user

739
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,279
says oh actually it doesn't fit

740
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
it's even though it was fast enough and

741
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,640
it's it looks good

742
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,399
they realize no no that's not what i

743
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
actually wanted it doesn't work in my

744
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,520
application

745
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
and so then you have to go back to the

746
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,279
beginning and start over

747
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,919
this type of picture of having stages

748
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,880
feeding into

749
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
subsequent stages this is called a

750
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,159
waterfall

751
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
and waterfalls are never good because

752
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,960
when you have a waterfall

753
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,600
if you have a problem at the bottom you

754
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
have to go back to the top

755
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,440
and start over and well maybe you can

756
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,000
fix it

757
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,520
a few stages before but it's much more

758
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,480
efficient to

759
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,039
think about the whole stack to

760
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,840
understand

761
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,480
everything that's happening and design

762
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,840
at the top

763
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,559
thinking about the rest of the picture

764
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,039
and

765
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,120
every stage looks ahead to what's

766
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
happening and people talk to each other

767
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,159
at the beginning but that's a big

768
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,640
project it takes a lot of time it takes

769
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
many years to

770
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
do all of this and to do it correctly

771
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,279
all right so that's what i mean by key

772
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,399
finding 10

773
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,360
and the high time now we don't have time

774
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,159
to go into

775
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,720
all the details of how these crypto

776
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
systems work we'll have one which we're

777
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
going to show you some basis

778
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
but at least to leave you with some

779
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,880
summaries

780
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
of what these systems are so that you

781
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
know like if somebody is trying to sell

782
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,799
you post quantum cryptography

783
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,360
then they should tell you what is the

784
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,440
assumption behind these what is the

785
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
thing that the attacker

786
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
is assumed not to be able to break and

787
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,240
so there are five big families

788
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,120
of the public key systems that we study

789
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
in post-quantum cartography

790
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,080
and i've been narrowing them down to

791
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,320
sometimes saying only encryption

792
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,799
sometimes saying only signatures so

793
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,880
encryption is the path that does

794
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,039
confidentiality signatures is the part

795
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,200
that does integrity and authenticity

796
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,760
and some of these schemes could actually

797
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
be used for both

798
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
but they're only really good for one of

799
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
them so for instance codebase

800
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
cryptography is an area i really like

801
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,760
but all the signature schemes that we

802
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,039
have seen from there

803
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,080
are not what you want to use so

804
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,279
i'm only saying code based encryption

805
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
and so the highlight of this is that has

806
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,919
been around for a very very long time

807
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,279
it is one year younger than rsa rsa was

808
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
the first

809
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
public key system that is described as a

810
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,159
public key encryption system from 1997

811
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,600
that is older than most people in the

812
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,679
audience here and then just one year

813
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,559
younger

814
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,840
is class is mcaleese who described a

815
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
system that is based on what we call

816
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
error correcting codes so that's not

817
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,279
codes as an implementation

818
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,679
or codes as in secret language this is

819
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,000
codes as in adding redundancy

820
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
so that when you're looking at a file

821
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,120
and it has been

822
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,159
well compromised but just by errors that

823
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,360
you can recover

824
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,960
the file so that is what we call error

825
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,120
correcting codes and he noticed

826
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,520
that you can turn the problem of

827
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
decoding

828
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,799
such codes into a cryptosystem

829
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,320
hash based signatures is what we're

830
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
actually going to spend a few minutes on

831
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,320
to explain so that is the another thing

832
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
which has a very solid theory

833
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,760
also goes back to the 70s and

834
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,279
the benefits there are that the

835
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,159
public keys are relatively small and it

836
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,760
has very few properties i should also

837
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,399
say for the

838
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,039
for the mclean system one advantage is

839
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,159
that the messages are very very short

840
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
public keys are large then isagenie

841
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
based crypto is a little bit

842
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,320
the new kit on the blog so we're not so

843
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,679
sure about that security

844
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
it has some very desirable features when

845
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,880
you care about

846
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
the sizes so dan was mentioning in this

847
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,799
waterfall that at some point you might

848
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,919
hit a block

849
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,760
because it's too large it doesn't fit

850
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
into things and codebase crypto

851
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,600
sorry i certainly based crypto the

852
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,880
advertisement is

853
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
that what you're dealing with is

854
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,240
relatively small

855
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,720
overall the smallest codebase crypto has

856
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,559
shorter ciphertext but gigantic

857
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,360
public keys code-based crypto both the

858
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
ciphertext

859
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,679
and the public keys are relatively small

860
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
i kept doing the same thank you so i

861
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
certainly have

862
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,120
small cipher text and small public keys

863
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,880
and the security now that's where you

864
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
need a ton of mathematics

865
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,200
to even understand what i'm saying so

866
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
there are mathematical objects called

867
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,399
elliptic curves and those you might

868
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,480
encounter in a course of cryptography

869
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,039
now isogen based cryptography is doing

870
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,480
some maps between

871
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,200
different curves and then the hardness

872
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,000
assumption is

873
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,720
that if you started on some curve and

874
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
somebody just tells you

875
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,720
the end of this computation some other

876
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
elliptic curve where you ended up

877
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,880
that it is hard to trace back how you

878
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,679
could possibly get there

879
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,919
and from all we know this is a problem

880
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,360
which even a quantum computer can't

881
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,000
solve

882
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
efficiently but it is a relatively new

883
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,760
problem so it is

884
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,120
less well studied it's a problem from

885
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,760
the 2000s lettuce-based cryptography

886
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,120
is well kind of an overall pretty okay

887
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
system so you have small public keys

888
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
small cipher text and you can also use

889
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,720
it for signature schemes

890
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,200
similarly small public smallish public

891
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,760
keys

892
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,640
smaller signatures it's kind of

893
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,760
versatile it's kind of

894
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,320
everywhere it is newer so we're less

895
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,679
sure about the security

896
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,240
and the hardness is finding something

897
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,559
which is called a short vector

898
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
in a lattice and then multivariate

899
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,039
quadratics

900
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,640
if you want to learn more about this you

901
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
are actually in the right country

902
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
because buying yang who was kind enough

903
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,200
to announce us

904
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,519
is a world leading expert in this area

905
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,279
and so there the advertisement

906
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,919
is that it is a scheme where it has very

907
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,240
short signatures

908
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
somewhat biggest public keys so that's

909
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
one of the downsides

910
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,640
and then the hardness relies on solving

911
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
systems of equations

912
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,120
now you probably have seen systems that

913
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,000
are linear and you're getting like

914
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,279
5 x plus 7 y is this

915
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,440
and you get another equation x and y and

916
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,559
you learned that this is easy to solve

917
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,360
what changes here is that they are not

918
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,399
linear not just

919
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
x but you also have x times y or you

920
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,119
have an x squared or y squared

921
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,159
and a few more variables a few more x

922
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,040
and y's

923
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
and a lot more equations and that is

924
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,639
another hard problem

925
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,480
in this case where signature scheme can

926
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
be based on

927
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
all right let's look at one of these in

928
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
a little more detail

929
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,399
inside signatures first of all what is

930
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,399
the data flow in a signature

931
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,440
well alice on the left side has a

932
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
message a picture or a document to send

933
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,119
to bob

934
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,320
and alice also makes a secret key that's

935
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,199
the

936
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
secret key all the way on the left and

937
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
then alice also

938
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,199
publishes something that everybody sees

939
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,399
bob knows this

940
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,119
public key and also the attacker sees

941
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,560
the public key

942
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
alice and bob do not share a secret and

943
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,000
now

944
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,560
alice uses the secret key and the

945
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,440
message to

946
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,119
somehow create a modified message a

947
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,160
signed message

948
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,920
to send through the network and then

949
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
that's received by bob and bob uses the

950
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,760
public key

951
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,040
to extract the original message

952
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,279
now if eve tries changing the message

953
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
corrupts the integrity of the message

954
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,240
changes the message to something else

955
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,440
then bob using the public key

956
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,839
will say wait a minute something went

957
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,480
wrong

958
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
what's the right message i don't know

959
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,599
what the right message is somebody

960
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,200
changed the message

961
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
so a signature system stops eve from

962
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,119
changing messages or making new messages

963
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,000
for hash-based signatures the only thing

964
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,960
you need

965
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,720
is a good hash function every signature

966
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,400
system that people use

967
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,599
has a hash function this is a function a

968
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,680
mathematical function that takes a

969
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,400
message of

970
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
any length and hashes it well does some

971
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
computation

972
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,640
which produces for example 256 bits

973
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,240
or 512 bits some short constant length

974
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,440
string every signature scheme that we

975
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,920
use

976
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,640
has a hash function hash based

977
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,920
signatures

978
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,480
all you need is a hash function the once

979
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,560
you have a hash function you can sign

980
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
messages and we'll actually show you a

981
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
little bit of how that works

982
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
quantum computers well grover's

983
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
algorithm can be used to

984
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,079
reduce the security of hash functions so

985
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
use at least 256 bits

986
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,280
or more but then you're safe against

987
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,400
quantum computers

988
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
and this is something which goes back

989
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,119
also to the 1970s

990
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,040
all right so if you want to use

991
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
something today and you don't want to

992
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,839
just

993
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,280
take things from the internet or the

994
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
nist competition where you see things

995
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,920
disappear and disappear and disappearing

996
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
here are some systems which are

997
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
basically on the fast track

998
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
these have already been standardized

999
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,320
this time not by nist but by the

1000
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,000
crypto farm research group so that is a

1001
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,119
part of the ietf which is well the

1002
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,520
engineering task force um all right

1003
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,560
these are the people

1004
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,440
who specify what your browser has to

1005
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,119
support in order to be allowed to go

1006
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,000
online

1007
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,359
and what the servers have to be

1008
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,520
supporting in order to serve your

1009
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,440
browser the right cryptography

1010
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,599
now i said before that nist is typically

1011
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,599
setting the standards for internet

1012
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,000
in this case we had that the cfrg went

1013
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,119
ahead and said

1014
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,560
here are some systems which are

1015
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
sufficiently well specified

1016
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,119
that we can standardize them however

1017
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,079
watch out

1018
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,720
the caption doesn't say signature scheme

1019
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
it has some extra words there

1020
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
and those words are important so it says

1021
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,359
that it's a stateful

1022
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,119
signature scheme now stateful

1023
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,440
means that you must be able to count

1024
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,520
that you have to remember

1025
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,839
basically what you have done and it's

1026
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,000
not the normal data flow not what was

1027
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,440
then was shown like there is

1028
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,880
e secret key and a public key

1029
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,839
stateful means you actually have a whole

1030
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,800
sequence or an

1031
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,079
array of secret keys and you have to

1032
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,880
tick them off one by one you have to

1033
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,599
remember

1034
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,359
i have done three signatures i've used

1035
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,520
the first three keys

1036
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,240
in my one secret key and you have to

1037
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,400
remember this pointer

1038
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,599
if you ever go back and reuse

1039
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,560
say the second key for a second

1040
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
signature

1041
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,160
then the attacker can break it the

1042
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,000
attacker gets too much information from

1043
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,800
that

1044
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
so if you're in a situation where you

1045
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,560
can count yeah i know you all learned

1046
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,119
accounting

1047
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,200
even before you went to primary school

1048
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,160
but your computer

1049
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,320
might not actually be as able to count

1050
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,359
as you think it would be

1051
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,800
for instance if you're using virtual

1052
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
machines you might be

1053
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,680
storing your virtual machine you're

1054
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
recovering your virtual machine from an

1055
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,079
image

1056
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,960
well at that point you're going back to

1057
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,800
the point where it was at that point

1058
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
maybe you have done a few more

1059
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
signatures since but

1060
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,760
since restored from image your pointer

1061
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,839
is back up here so if you're in that

1062
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:10,560
scenario

1063
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,240
you cannot use this but other scenarios

1064
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,920
are for instance if you're a debian

1065
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
developer and you're signing the code

1066
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,880
release

1067
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,960
well you better be able to count you

1068
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
better know exactly where this

1069
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,520
key was used for signature so debian was

1070
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,359
actually saying yeah we are interested

1071
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,480
in using the system

1072
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
please give us a full specification we

1073
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,160
would like to use this

1074
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,480
and also if you're on a smart card like

1075
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
if you if you're working on hardware

1076
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,119
and you have some chip card those also

1077
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,240
have memory

1078
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,200
which is able to well keep state to

1079
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,760
count

1080
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
so if you're in that situation here are

1081
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,520
two links and the slides will be online

1082
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,160
you can just

1083
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,960
click on those which specify hash based

1084
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
signature schemes with all the benefits

1085
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,760
that then was just saying that they

1086
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,359
don't need anything other than a good

1087
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,079
signature

1088
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,680
a good hash function now that get a

1089
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,079
signature and a post quantum

1090
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,040
now nist is doing in parallel to the

1091
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,319
competition

1092
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,079
a fast track version of standardizing

1093
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,440
these schemes as well

1094
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,359
so in this case the cfid went ahead

1095
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,520
standardized them and now nist is saying

1096
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,119
hey okay we're taking the same they

1097
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,560
asked for a few comments

1098
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
but we're expecting this standard to

1099
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,480
come out soon again this is for stateful

1100
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,920
hash based signatures

1101
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,240
they're not full-fledged signatures

1102
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,040
however

1103
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,839
they are ready to use and also iso which

1104
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,240
is

1105
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,040
international standards organization um

1106
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,359
has now a track on standardizing

1107
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,359
these hash functions or these hash based

1108
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,040
signatures

1109
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,319
let's look at just one example of how

1110
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,839
hash based signatures work and then

1111
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,000
we'll finish up

1112
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
this is going to be complete

1113
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,040
signature code in python for signing

1114
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,280
using hash based signatures with one

1115
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
restriction

1116
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,440
the restriction is we can only sign one

1117
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,319
message

1118
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,839
the empty message that might sound

1119
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,119
a little silly do that sounds useful

1120
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,200
except if you think about it actually

1121
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
that's very useful

1122
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,839
maybe you have an alert message

1123
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,400
for example you have one message which

1124
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,359
says

1125
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,640
typhoon warning on this date

1126
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,440
and then you don't want somebody to

1127
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,960
forge that message

1128
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,040
you want to be able to check is this the

1129
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,359
real message from the right person from

1130
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,400
alice with the

1131
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,800
the right public key and then you can

1132
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
have another public key for tomorrow and

1133
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,079
another public key for the next

1134
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,480
day and so an alert message is something

1135
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,680
that should be signed

1136
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,880
for security and also once you

1137
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,760
understand how empty messages are signed

1138
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,960
then

1139
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,119
it's actually not too hard to do longer

1140
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,640
messages but just we'll just do

1141
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,680
empty messages so here's the

1142
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,960
key generation alice is taking some

1143
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,440
random data the os.u random

1144
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,960
from the operating system 32 bytes

1145
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,000
256 bits of random data and

1146
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,680
hashing those with sha 3 256 which is

1147
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,119
in hash lib and well okay you have to

1148
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
have sufficiently recent version of

1149
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,400
python to have

1150
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
shot 3 256 in hash lib and maybe say

1151
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
hash lib.sha 3256 but this is all built

1152
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,839
into

1153
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,160
python python has the hash functions for

1154
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,200
you

1155
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
and then the important point is the

1156
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
public key

1157
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,319
alice's public key is the hash of

1158
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,680
the random secret and then

1159
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,400
alice well remembers the secret and

1160
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
publishes the public key

1161
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,839
as an example here's well making

1162
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,960
one key pair from this sign empty and

1163
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,880
it's just some random data

1164
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,720
is the public key and some random data

1165
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,119
is the secret key and the public key is

1166
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,760
a hash

1167
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,319
of the secret key and this public key

1168
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,200
alice

1169
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
announces everybody knows this public

1170
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
key is from alice

1171
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,319
and now let's sign a message

1172
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,359
the signature of the empty message

1173
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,880
is simply the secret

1174
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,040
if alice wants to say okay alert

1175
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,200
alice simply publishes the secret

1176
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,640
and then if you want to check has this

1177
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,480
message has the empty message been

1178
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,440
signed you simply take this

1179
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,240
signed message the secret from alice and

1180
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,359
you hash it

1181
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,400
and if it matches the public key then

1182
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,319
okay you've got the empty message if it

1183
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,000
doesn't match then you say

1184
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,839
bad signature the only person who can

1185
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,079
sign a message is alice because

1186
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,960
alice is the only person who knows that

1187
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,400
random secret

1188
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,440
with the right hash everybody can check

1189
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,880
and alice is the only person who can

1190
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,560
make a signature

1191
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,720
and then well this is just using these

1192
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
functions and if you sign the empty

1193
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,200
message

1194
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,920
anybody can check and they get the empty

1195
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
message back

1196
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,240
if you try forging a message you have to

1197
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,960
figure out the secret or figure out some

1198
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,599
string which hashes to the public key

1199
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,000
and

1200
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,560
until alice reveals that secret that's

1201
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,760
hard to do

1202
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,160
you can only use this once because then

1203
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,839
alice has revealed the secret and then

1204
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,359
it gets more complicated so you should

1205
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,079
look at

1206
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,440
tonya's lectures on hash based

1207
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
signatures and then you'll see how you

1208
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,160
can do more

1209
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,800
sign more bits of messages and sign

1210
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,400
arbitrary length messages

1211
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,640
and this was actually from a mini school

1212
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,760
that was here in

1213
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,440
july and uh okay you'll finish it up

1214
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,599
so um just to give you some

1215
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,640
recommendations

1216
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,119
um these are absolutely unbiased

1217
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,280
objective recommendations these are the

1218
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,520
best post quantum systems that nist test

1219
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,760
in its round three

1220
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,720
which by definitions visual which by

1221
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,359
definition

1222
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,000
are exactly the systems that we and our

1223
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
collaborators here in

1224
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,920
academia seneca submitted so here are

1225
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,560
the links

1226
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,040
um these are one code based system so

1227
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,839
that is the

1228
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,880
encryption system going back to 1978.

1229
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,119
rainbow is a multivariate signature

1230
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,400
system

1231
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,680
there's n2 prime which is a

1232
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,440
lattice-based encryption system

1233
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,200
and swings plus which is a hash based

1234
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,839
signatures so four of the five

1235
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,760
areas and exactly the four which i said

1236
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
have been relatively well studied

1237
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
we have submissions in the last round of

1238
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,880
nist and we

1239
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
do think that these are the future so

1240
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,839
if you want to settle on something

1241
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,200
before this finishes

1242
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,920
this is our recommendation but of course

1243
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
you should take a look at more things so

1244
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,720
we have a whole bunch of more

1245
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,079
information online

1246
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,599
so please go there please look and well

1247
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,480
try to break try to use and see whether

1248
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,599
it fits

1249
00:45:47,599 --> 00:46:01,839
thank you for your attention

1250
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,839
foreign

1251
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,240
we have some bonus slides if you don't

1252
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,079
want to ask questions we can keep you

1253
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,319
busy for

1254
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,079
several hours we have slides for how to

1255
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,960
sign one bit message

1256
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,400
we have slides for signing two bit

1257
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,359
messages three bit messages

1258
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,040
four bit okay somebody has a question

1259
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,640
okay you have mentioned that

1260
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,000
we have to panic because our message

1261
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,040
will be revealed

1262
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,759
in 10 years

1263
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,720
as far as we know the uh our pro of

1264
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
government is provide

1265
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,920
in eid which use

1266
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,119
isa 22048

1267
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,800
as a core to suggest

1268
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,079
the government to switch

1269
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,920
the system such that we can avoid the

1270
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,839
attack from the computers

1271
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,760
so i think for everything which is

1272
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
public key cryptography

1273
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,960
for encryption where you need to ensure

1274
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,920
secrecy so confidentiality for more than

1275
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,880
10 years

1276
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,839
i would recommend all the you in well

1277
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,200
trying to deploy

1278
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,440
postpartum encryption systems for

1279
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,119
signature schemes

1280
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,680
it's a different story signature schemes

1281
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
matter at the moment when you check when

1282
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
you verify whether the signature is

1283
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,480
valid

1284
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,720
at that point you must trust that nobody

1285
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,079
has a quantum computer

1286
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,440
so at the moment if you verify a

1287
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
signature we don't believe that anybody

1288
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,040
has a quantum computer

1289
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,920
so we do believe that right now if you

1290
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,839
verify an rsa signature

1291
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,240
it is actually a valid signature so in

1292
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,000
that sense you could say

1293
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,760
signatures are less urgent we normally

1294
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,400
encourage

1295
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,760
people to already do use public key

1296
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,400
the supposed quantum signatures now

1297
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,960
because

1298
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
typically you use signatures when you're

1299
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,240
working on operating system updates and

1300
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,960
so if the signature system is your way

1301
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,359
to

1302
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,760
change the cryptography behind it so if

1303
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,599
you want to use it in order to

1304
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,400
well update the system then you must be

1305
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,200
sure that the

1306
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,640
attacker doesn't have a quantum computer

1307
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,800
yet when using it and so you're getting

1308
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,920
into this

1309
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,280
well what comes first problem so for

1310
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,599
that

1311
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,079
it helps to actually have postponed

1312
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,359
signatures deployed

1313
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,000
however it depends on how long the

1314
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,920
lifetime of the product is if it's a

1315
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,880
product

1316
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,359
like a passport is only good for 10

1317
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,240
years

1318
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,160
so if in those 10 years we don't believe

1319
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,520
a quantum computer

1320
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
will have the power to break a signature

1321
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,760
system then the first

1322
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,000
batch of signatures sorry first batch of

1323
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,839
passports will still be fine

1324
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,400
but at some point you run into issues

1325
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,839
where you have to make predictions about

1326
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,640
the future

1327
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,160
say passwords in five years you're

1328
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,760
making a prediction about the future in

1329
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,720
15 years

1330
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,160
that the attacker doesn't have a quantum

1331
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,800
computer and then

1332
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:46,079
it gets unclear test test

1333
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,119
okay we would like well there is there

1334
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,680
are a few algorithms in the fourth or

1335
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,000
third round of the nist competition and

1336
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,160
one of them is from seneca and

1337
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,200
it's it's really the pro of taiwan i

1338
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,520
but i'm a crypto i'm student currently

1339
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,520
studying in cryograph

1340
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,920
cryptography but i must admit i

1341
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,599
understand almost nothing

1342
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,079
nothing and nothing like those things on

1343
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,040
the side but

1344
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,400
we would still like to contribute but

1345
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,040
we have no idea what kind of way can we

1346
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,480
contribute to the

1347
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,119
whole to the whole thing or to the

1348
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,559
algorithms that

1349
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,760
cynical build like can we is there any

1350
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,160
specs for us to follow or maybe we can

1351
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,960
view

1352
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,800
how how can we help help help writing

1353
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,280
writing some codes on github to do some

1354
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,319
maybe go

1355
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,800
python or rust implementations or even

1356
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,760
we can

1357
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,040
just just a guess we can contact like

1358
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,240
mtk or nd to build some

1359
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,079
special specifically crafted

1360
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,040
instructions inside the cpu to make the

1361
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,079
cost of the of our scenic algorithm

1362
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,839
more in the sense in a sense more cheap

1363
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,079
is there any other ways that you

1364
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,359
recommend us to

1365
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,880
contribute to the the whole thing

1366
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,880
so sorry sure of course you can

1367
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
contribute by breaking some crypto

1368
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,480
systems but you you sounded interested

1369
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,359
in writing

1370
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,040
software break the others

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,240
um yeah so there's a long answer for how

1372
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,520
to get uh

1373
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
how to get more information is well

1374
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,960
there's lots of links to follow but the

1375
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,280
short answer what you really should do

1376
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,240
is talk to young boyin here because he

1377
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,720
is

1378
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,400
the master of making everything run fast

1379
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,559
and he's been making multivariate

1380
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,920
quadratic systems

1381
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,640
and lattice systems and so on run really

1382
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,119
fast

1383
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,839
and he has lots of projects which are

1384
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,440
projects that you can start on some of

1385
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,920
them are

1386
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,240
projects that you you i mean you need

1387
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,319
programming experience but

1388
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,559
no particular cryptographic experience

1389
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,160
and then there's more advanced projects

1390
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,680
if you're if you're through the initial

1391
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,240
project

1392
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,640
but it is very useful to have software

1393
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,000
that is implementing these

1394
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
cryptographic systems and then there's

1395
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,480
more advanced challenges for example

1396
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,559
testing the software it's not so good if

1397
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,000
the software doesn't work

1398
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,400
and then there's actually verification

1399
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,480
systems you can try to have the computer

1400
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,160
checking automatically that the

1401
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
software works and there's more advanced

1402
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,359
things but anyway

1403
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,160
so talk to bayon yang and he will tell

1404
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,960
you what the

1405
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
top priority projects are

1406
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,200
let me let me add a little bit of

1407
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,280
advertisement if you want to learn more

1408
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,800
about these systems

1409
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,119
the last slide includes a bunch of links

1410
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,040
and i'm still waiting for

1411
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,119
the same person to come up with another

1412
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,079
url

1413
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,920
because the summer school he ran here in

1414
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,319
july also has recordings

1415
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,480
and then of course we have a lot more

1416
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,079
time if you're only talking about hash

1417
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,119
based signatures

1418
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,599
for full hour so we can go into much

1419
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,200
more detail than we could

1420
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,720
covering the whole field of post quantum

1421
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,480
cryptography and then trying to

1422
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,160
highlight one little piece

1423
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,240
so i mean we do have some of the slides

1424
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,599
copied here but is a lot more

1425
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,240
information

1426
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,640
in the full slide set and his summer

1427
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,319
school covered all the areas

1428
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,240
and of course we are also happy to take

1429
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
contributions for our systems not just

1430
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,879
for bullions

1431
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,839
and how

1432
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,839
foreign

1433
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,240
you
