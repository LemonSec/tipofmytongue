so to begin with i'm going to give you a

6
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
bit of a background about us as speakers

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,400
um our our history together and then

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
and contain

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
so to begin with i'm

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
team cumry

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,680

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,360
so

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
maybe this is not the first time to meet

22
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,320
you

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
it's a great honor to give a talk about

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
again and it's really sad that i cannot

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
reach taiwan this time i wish i could

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
meet you shortly soon and also

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
i wish

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
our presentation will be something

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200
useful to you yeah right

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
yeah thank you thank you manabu um and

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,879
and i guess i echo some of those um

32
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,200
those sentiments as well um it's a shame

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
that we can't be in there in person um

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
to meet everybody

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,080
um and i think that's what

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
is is behind our talk in some ways is is

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,599
this idea of how we

38
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
can continue to collaborate in a in a

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
new normal

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
so when we were first submitting this

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
talk

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
as a call for paper we were kind of in

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
the in a state of flux where

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,040
everybody was working from home we you

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
know we couldn't collaborate with

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,879
each other but we also almost couldn't

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,239
collaborate with our colleagues in the

48
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
same way and we couldn't meet in person

49
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,239
so

50
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
as as the year has gone by this talk has

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,519
evolved in some ways

52
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
to look at how we can

53
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
speak about our our own experiences of

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
collaboration to hopefully

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
encourage others to do the same

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
uh based on

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
what a new normal might look like if we

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
you know if we're moving towards remote

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
working how can we continue to have

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,599
these kind of

61
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,319
conversations and and joint working

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
efforts

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,239
and and what are the the mechanisms and

64
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
the the ways we can

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
ensure that that takes place

66
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
um so we'd come up with the

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
the strap line of work from home

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
collaborate from home

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
so the talk today will contain

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
examples of the the collaboration that

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
myself and manabu have have undertaken

72
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,440
together

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,159
and then we'll talk about how we've then

74
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
shared those collaborations with others

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
some successes some failures some

76
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
advice for others i guess

77
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
um and and so yes there's some tips on

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
sharing who to who to share with in

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,159
order to make the the largest impact

80
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,720
possible i guess we're all in this

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
industry for the for similar kind of

82
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
reasons to

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
improve internet safety to mitigate

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
losses or harms of victims

85
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
and so it's important that we we kind of

86
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
all work together to achieve this

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
objective

88
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
so we're going to use a couple of

89
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
examples as as i mentioned and the first

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
one is ghost dns

91
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,360
and i'll give a brief introduction into

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
what goes to ns is first if if it's not

93
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
something that people are aware of or

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,479
have come across before

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
it's not really a threat that targets

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
directly the the asian region but as as

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,199
we'll discuss it's something that in

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
theory could do in the future

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
or has done under different guises

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
so ghostiness is a

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
dns hijacking campaign or toolkit which

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
is sold on the dark web for about 450 us

103
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
dollars

104
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
and it incorporates a number of

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
different open source elements so it

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
it's basically a toolkit that's

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,919
you know

108
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,479
put together based on tools that are

109
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,639
available to for anybody to use

110
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,120
effectively um so in the example here

111
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
it's using mass scan for it's it's

112
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,080
scanning scanning element

113
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
and and based on various different

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
numbers

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
that we've seen being mentioned there's

116
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,600
been upwards of a hundred thousand

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
soho routers uh that were compromised

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
using this uh infrastructure

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,840
um so it mainly targets residential

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
internet users um you know based on

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
issues around

122
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
credentials outdated firmware they're

123
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
the easiest targets for this

124
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
and there's a real focus on south

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
american users

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
we believe that the

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
at least the developers and the creators

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
of ghost dns are

129
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,280
likely brazilian based and then also

130
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
some of the the users of toolkit as well

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,199
and the main focus is in credential

132
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
harvesting so taking

133
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
credits from banking e-commerce

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
a number of different other services

135
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
like we mentioned here with netflix

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,919
and then selling those credentials at

137
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,880
scale on the dark web so you know

138
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
taking bank account information and

139
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
selling it for a couple of dollars and

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
then

141
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
repeating that um across you know the

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
hundreds of thousands of victims that

143
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
potentially lost credentials in this way

144
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,039
um

145
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
so in terms of why this is relevant um

146
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,720
for a threat that's

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
you know targeting brazil

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
um

149
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,080
we think it it's still relevant because

150
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
it's

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
you know it's been around for a number

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
of years now uh it's not particularly

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
sophisticated as we mentioned it's

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
it's based on open source tooling open

155
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
source scripts it's

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
it's something that

157
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
you know you don't need much um

158
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
technical know-how to to use and to

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
operate but yeah it's still been huge

160
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
huge is successful

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
with hundreds of thousands of victims as

162
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
we mentioned

163
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
and the way that we work is changing

164
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
this goes back to the point of remote

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,759
working

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
and so we feel like soho routers are

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
going to become increasingly attractive

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
targets

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,759
um and and then the final point is um

170
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
using this as an example to consider

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
whether we're prepared for more

172
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,840
sophisticated actors using this

173
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
technique or using soho routers in some

174
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,599
form

175
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
and we point to the the recent example

176
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,400
um based on reports from

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
france that apt-31 have been using

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,479
compromised routers to target

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
organizations in france it shows that

180
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
this is something that you know isn't

181
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
restricted to

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
cyber criminals it can be used by nation

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
states as well

184
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
and then also interestingly um as we've

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
been tracking uh ghost dns over the past

186
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,280
year or so

187
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
we've seen a real spike in activity um

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,280
beginning

189
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
last october

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
up until around july of this year

191
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,199
and so we felt like

192
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
comparing you know like for like month

193
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
on month this showed a real uh clear

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
peaking activity that we felt might be

195
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
related to the actors who were operating

196
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
ghost dns or operating

197
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
similar exploits

198
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,319
to basically be making the most of the

199
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
pandemic knowing that a lot of people

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
were at home using the home computers

201
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
for various different things

202
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
and and effectively trying to

203
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
take advantage of that as much as

204
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,958
possible

205
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
um so now we're going to talk about how

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
we've then

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,000
you know once we've completed our work

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
together how we'd then shared that or

209
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
tried to share that with other people so

210
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,399
manabu first is going to talk about

211
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
um some of the i guess the failures or

212
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
the the the less successful um outcomes

213
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,040
that we've had

214
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,839
okay

215
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
let me share favorites i made relating

216
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
to ghost dns

217
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
i shared collected io sheets with salt

218
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,720
beer

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,519
the national south of brazil

220
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,320
so

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
my friend who works at the national she

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,839
said in japan

223
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,279
but

224
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,880
nothing happened

225
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
there is no reply no reaction from salt

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
beer

227
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
please go ahead

228
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
in retrospect

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,120
i think

230
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
my attitude towards information sharing

231
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
is not good

232
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,480
i just shared a list of biosheets

233
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
i should share a context

234
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,600
of information because

235
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
you know

236
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
context matters

237
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
also

238
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,760
yeah information makes sense with a

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
context

240
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
just a

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
list of io sheets does not make any

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
sense

243
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
also

244
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,959
i have to set a shared goal of

245
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,119
collaboration with the opponent

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
okay and then now i'm going to talk

247
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
about um some of the successes i guess

248
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
that we had

249
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
um in follow-up to that so

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
taking uh manabu's experiences in in

251
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
interfacing with vr

252
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
we we established some further contacts

253
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
with them um

254
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
as manabu mentions um talking about

255
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,399
context

256
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,640
talking about

257
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,040
effectively their objectives in in

258
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
tracking ghost dns it's a very

259
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
interesting subject for them as you can

260
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
imagine with the the number of victims

261
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
and and you know we were able to do that

262
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
in part because we have existing

263
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
relationships um we've we have um

264
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
contacts in in brazil who were able to

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
to to effectively link us up with with

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
people in serbia

267
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
and i think this really underlines the

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
importance of

269
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120
of relationship building in in this

270
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
space um so c certs and certs are always

271
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,320
organizations that you want to be

272
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
sharing information with or

273
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,600
liaising with as much as possible if if

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
you come across something that you feel

275
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,720
like it might be of interest to

276
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
a country at a national level i think

277
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
those organizations the best place to

278
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
start but as as manabu mentions it's

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
about

280
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
establishing

281
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,079
the context and what that looks like um

282
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,839
i i mentioned here priorities and

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,200
patience

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
you know a cert is dealing with any

285
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
number of different threats it

286
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,959
at one particular time and it might be

287
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
that your piece of information is

288
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
interesting but it might not rank in the

289
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
top of their list

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
for priority at that time

291
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,839
so it's it's about being patient and you

292
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,959
know if

293
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,040
following up if you don't get a response

294
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
but but being patient waiting for the

295
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
answer and and then working towards

296
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
not just sharing your information

297
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,440
because you think it's interesting but

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,839
also working with the other party to to

299
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,760
establish what would be of of use to

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
them it might be that they've already

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
had that information shared in the past

302
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,279
um

303
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
and i think another important area is in

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
in social media

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
and and

306
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
maybe the way that we use it within

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
uh the cyber security community um you

308
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
know a lot of people are using social

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
media as a

310
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
mechanism for

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,959
ingesting iocs you know

312
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
we've turned something that is a a human

313
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
platform into an automated

314
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,480
um

315
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,399
you know automated data collection

316
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
environment effectively and

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
maybe we're not using it in the way that

318
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,120
we should maybe we should be you know

319
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,800
reaching out more speaking to different

320
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
people if we see somebody reporting on

321
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
something that is also of interest to us

322
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
can we be reaching out more

323
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
sharing the conversation sharing our

324
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,040
findings and i think that's a really

325
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
interesting area that we i guess we need

326
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
to we're almost forced to get into

327
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
because of the the changing landscape

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,600
with the with the pandemic

329
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
and then the second example

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
is uh mocau or xloader which manabu is

331
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
going to introduce

332
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
okay

333
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
is um

334
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,079
android marker

335
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,360
it is

336
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,480
spread via sms and login servers

337
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
a campaign splitting mukhau is known as

338
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
xiaowei in taiwan

339
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,639
required

340
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,240
at the moment

341
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,040
sms is the main attack vector of local

342
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,720
there is a url over landing page in um

343
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
sms

344
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,360
and a victim is navigated to

345
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
download look how if a big team uses um

346
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,560
android smartphone

347
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
otherwise

348
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,639
if a victim uses iphone

349
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,440
a big image navigate navigated to a

350
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
phishing website which impersonates

351
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
approval

352
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
yep pretty well

353
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
this is um

354
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
overview of local distribution on monday

355
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
in september

356
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
france

357
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
japan

358
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
germany south korea the united states

359
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
turkey and

360
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
taiwan are targeted

361
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
with why

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
again taiwan is one of the targets of

363
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,839
moko

364
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,800
mokau uses a transport service in taiwan

365
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
as a work

366
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,839
uh

367
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
excuse me i'm not sure how to pronounce

368
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,120
it in

369
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
your language i mean traditional chinese

370
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
but i can read a cubing in

371
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,279
in japanese and i know it's a it means a

372
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
transport service under

373
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
yeah

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
that's why

375
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,560
and then an another element of our um

376
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
researcher tracking of of how has been

377
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
looking at the network telemetry uh that

378
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
team comrie is able to provide

379
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
um and looking in particular at second

380
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
stage c2 servers

381
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,000
so at this stage we we know that

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,959
um

383
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
a potential victim has already

384
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
downloaded the the malicious apk and so

385
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,000
this is the follow-up connection

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
generated by by the malicious file

387
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
and as you can see here we we've

388
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
redacted the the victim ip addresses but

389
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
we have

390
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,880
have seen consistent victims connecting

391
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
from taiwan

392
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
and and we've we've replicated this

393
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
across different countries as well um so

394
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,639
one one of the things that we've tried

395
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
to do with our collaboration on mock how

396
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,480
is to show

397
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,360
um

398
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
show to different countries that it's

399
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
it's you know it's not a threat that

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
only targets asia as

401
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,199
manabu mentions we've seen victims in

402
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
france and germany and turkey around

403
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,320
europe the united states and i think the

404
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
more you raise the profile of a threat

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
the more that people can come together

406
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
and work on it

407
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,279
um so i passed back over to my nephew

408
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,399
okay yeah why is this really about

409
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
you know that you know

410
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,279
you know mario is working from home and

411
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
also

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
ordering from home

413
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,360
so

414
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
i think oster or transport service

415
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,440
becomes a private lawyer or a doctor

416
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,079
the transport services this is me

417
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
transport services in south korea taiwan

418
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,759
and japan are used as a rulers

419
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,600
by moka respond

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,199
and again

421
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,680
again let me explain my

422
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,640
collaboration periods period relating to

423
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
moko

424
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,199
i got a dm from a guy who claims he's a

425
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,400
researcher

426
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,359
and he took the legitimate

427
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,760
and looked like uh

428
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
looks like having a good reputation

429
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
online

430
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
he requested to share

431
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,280
more information i collected

432
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
then

433
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,120
i was so naive and i shared information

434
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,000
with him without any doubt

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,919
about

436
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,640
the he did not share anything with me

437
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,600
and also he published um article about

438
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
vocal without

439
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
credit

440
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,199
so appreciate

441
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
yeah excuse me yeah and yeah again he

442
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
didn't share anything with me and also

443
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
he published an article

444
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,080
about moko under his name without any

445
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
project of me so i was just robbed

446
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,240
yeah let's go ahead

447
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,799
lessons i learned is

448
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
be aware of the wrongs

449
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
trolls are everywhere

450
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,840
and

451
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,240
you should share information only with

452
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
possible persons or groups otherwise

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
you will be ruled

454
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,200
required

455
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,640
and the an issue to be solved is

456
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,600
creating a good relationship during the

457
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
pandemic because you know

458
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
getting to know each other well is

459
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
difficult nowadays

460
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
because you know the there are many

461
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
restrictions

462
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,720
for example i really

463
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,640
i really miss the peer bus of the

464
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,000
conference

465
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
in my opinion there should be a beer

466
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,039
brush of the conference because

467
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
it's a very good opportunity to make

468
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
friends yeah

469
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,080
i'm not sure because i haven't tried it

470
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,880
but

471
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
all boys gaza or something like that may

472
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
work

473
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,160
but i'm not sure yeah let me know if you

474
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
have a good solution or all that yeah

475
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
breathing right

476
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
and so to talk about

477
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
i guess again some of our successes with

478
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
collaboration

479
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
is is we look to work with a reputable

480
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
body so we worked with jp sir

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,039
um to to share some of our findings

482
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,200
uh and a lot of this was was based

483
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
around victim analysis and trend

484
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,280
analysis so so one of the

485
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,480
the questions that was asked was about

486
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,679
um

487
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,240
impact over time and so we looked at a

488
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
particular periods um in the in the

489
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
japanese calendar where

490
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
um there's public holidays the golden

491
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
week celebration and we saw a large

492
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,679
increase in in victim traffic over this

493
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,240
time period so it helps us to understand

494
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
the

495
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
the scale

496
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
the

497
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
effectiveness of some of the campaigns

498
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,240
you know targeting people as man of

499
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
being mentioned when

500
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,480
that they're more likely to be

501
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
doing online shopping or

502
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
um effectively you know that they're not

503
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
working so so that they're doing other

504
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
things with the internet at that time

505
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,559
and we saw that the actors really

506
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,600
targeting that period

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
and i guess

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
having established a

509
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
a collaboration effort based around

510
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,080
victim analysis it's allowed us to kind

511
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
of develop over time to look at other

512
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,080
areas

513
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,039
so obviously our our end goal in this is

514
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,000
to

515
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
help to identify and to to disrupt the

516
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
actors involved and to to identify their

517
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
infrastructure at a higher level

518
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
but but it started off with that initial

519
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,240
collaboration around around victims

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
and it's also opened up

521
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,480
you know manabu gave an example of a bad

522
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,799
situation with with a researcher but

523
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
it's also opened up opportunities for us

524
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
to work with with different researchers

525
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,000
on this topic

526
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
who've either reached out to us or we've

527
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,840
reached out to them because we've seen

528
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,039
that there's a shared interest in machow

529
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
and i think that's again a really a

530
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,520
valuable thing um is is just sharing

531
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
what you found and not being able not

532
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
being scared to to share what you found

533
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
is is really important

534
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,000
um and so now we're just going to

535
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
summarize um what we've spoken about

536
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,600
today uh and the sharing is caring um

537
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,959
i'm gonna be go ahead

538
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,799
okay

539
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
in conclusion

540
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,600
let me explain what i learned from areas

541
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
sharing information without

542
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
any context and

543
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,000
any commitment does not make sense

544
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
sharing is caring about the way of

545
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
sharing matters

546
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,600
and next point is

547
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,760
creating a shared goal with um

548
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,559
opponent is a key to success

549
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
yeah please why

550
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
and also

551
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
don't trust someone who you don't know

552
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
where even

553
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
he or she has a

554
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
good reputation online

555
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
because

556
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,080
maybe he or she may be a pro rather

557
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
everyone

558
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,039
and also

559
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,799
don't be afraid

560
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,600
be nice demand to take mother

561
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
yep

562
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
that's all

563
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
and then i've just got some some final

564
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
thoughts on on what we've spoken about

565
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,840
today and and for the future

566
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,480
um in summary um so the way we work and

567
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
collaborate has changed as we've spoken

568
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
about and as we're all aware

569
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360
um and so we i guess we've got to evolve

570
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,320
and adapt to that um and so we're

571
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
encouraging people to you know to not be

572
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
afraid to reach out to others you know

573
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,440
look at the people around you at the

574
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
conference

575
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,760
um

576
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
maybe take the opportunity today to

577
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,799
speak to some people that you've never

578
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
spoken to before find out what what

579
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
areas they're working in what's of

580
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
interest to them and and maybe you might

581
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,000
find something that you can you can work

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
on together and then also don't be

583
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
afraid to reach out to others

584
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
um

585
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,840
you know in in the

586
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,799
social media space or offer other um

587
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,159
avenues

588
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,720
but just exercise the caution and that

589
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
that manabu mentions about trolls and

590
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
people

591
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
um you know not collaborating on the on

592
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
an equal standing

593
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,640
and and also i guess the other side of

594
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
this is to be reflect receptive to

595
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
collaborate collaboration opportunities

596
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
that come from others

597
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
so in the same way that you would like

598
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
somebody to respond to you um

599
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,159
you know if somebody reaches out to ask

600
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,720
about your research um as long as it's

601
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
okay to share it then i i would

602
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
encourage to do that and and to try to

603
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
work with other people because i think

604
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,799
that sometimes we're not aware of

605
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,320
um

606
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
different thought processes or

607
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
ways of understanding a threat that can

608
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,159
be aided by by speaking to others and by

609
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,600
sharing um

610
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
sharing what we know

611
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,360
there's lots of you know groups and

612
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,640
forums and

613
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
mailing lists that people are likely to

614
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
be part of but i think it's it's always

615
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
useful and valuable to to be expanding

616
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
on those

617
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,799
um and utilize organizations like the

618
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
the cert in taiwan um

619
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
or certs around the world

620
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,240
you know that they're going to be

621
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,919
reputable you know that they're going to

622
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,520
be interested in

623
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,679
in useful information

624
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,919
and and there's ways that you can set up

625
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,640
data sharing uh information sharing in a

626
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,440
way that's going to protect your

627
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
interests protect you know if you're

628
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
working for an organization

629
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,000
um

630
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,279
you know maybe setting up a

631
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
non-disclosure agreement or something so

632
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
that you can share the information but

633
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,760
it doesn't necessarily get used in

634
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
in an open platform an open forum

635
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
again as as as manabu experience where

636
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
somebody else effectively stole his work

637
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,919
um so that that kind of finishes up what

638
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,120
we wanted to talk to you all about today

639
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,440
um i hope it's it's been useful and

640
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
maybe generated some

641
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,640
some ideas um and i i hope that you you

642
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
go away from this and

643
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,960
maybe collaborate with somebody with in

644
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
a an area or region that you'd never

645
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,919
thought about before

646
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,600
and i think you know working together

647
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,279
like that we can all kind of make a

648
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,600
larger impact in the world

649
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,679
so now we'd like to open up to any

650
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,600
questions um

651
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
i guess this will be

652
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,240
online based i'm not entirely sure

653
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
but if you

654
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,000
also want to reach out to us we're on

655
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,480
twitter um ninoseki and at team

656
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,880
comradery underscore s2 um if there's

657
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
questions that come up after after the

658
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,480
event or after the talk and we'd be

659
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
happy to hear from you

660
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,520

and the honor of speaking today um and

663
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080

664
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
able to me in person
