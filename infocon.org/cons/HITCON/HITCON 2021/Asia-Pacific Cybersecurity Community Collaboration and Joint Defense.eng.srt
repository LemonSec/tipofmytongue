00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
the next session will welcome thomas

2
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
miller from the cesar

3
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,599
to talk about some of the threats that

4
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,800
was faced

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,600
by the infrastructures in

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,079
in the u.s and in asia pacific

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,920
agency

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320

information about sort of what my agency

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,240
is and what we do in the united states

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
uh the top threats that we're concerned

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,600
about

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
and uh and how we can better work

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
together to deal with those threats um

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
going forward

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,639
so um

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
on to the uh on to the presentation i

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
suppose

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
so here's um here's the outline of what

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,079
i want to talk to you about today

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
first we're going to give a little bit

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,840
of background about sizza

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
um to explain what we are as well as

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
what we are not

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,319
then we're going to talk about the top

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
threat to u.s critical infrastructure

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
today

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
uh since that's um one of the number one

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
things that sizza is responsible for

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,239
trying to protect in the united states

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,920
we're going to talk about different ways

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
we are trying to fight that top threat

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
um

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
going into

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
how we can work together collaboratively

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
how we already do it in the united

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
states and how we do it internationally

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
as well

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
and then i hope we have uh

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
then i hope we have a lot of time at the

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
end for uh questions and answers as well

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
because i'm really looking forward to

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
the questions you have and hopefully i

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
can give you some really informative

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
answers

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,640
so

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
what is sizza

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
and we call ourselves nations risk

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,480
advisor

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
and the reason we say nation's risk

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,200
advisor is because we are not a we are

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
not a cyber regulator

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
we don't go around

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
imposing penalties on people for having

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
poor cyber security practices

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
um we do make recommendations on how

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
people can improve their cyber security

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,560
posture

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
we perform assessments of people's cyber

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
security posture

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
um to let them know where they can

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
improve we also perform incident

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,879
response in case of cyber security

87
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,400
incidents um so we and we perform hunts

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
so when we know about different types of

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
threats and indicators of compromise we

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
will send teams out to certain

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,319
organizations to perform a hunt action

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
which is a proactive way of finding a

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
threat that may already be in your

94
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
environment that you're not aware of

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
and we develop lots and lots of

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
recommendations and guidance that are

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
targeted at different audiences

98
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
throughout the united states and abroad

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
because any of our allies and partners

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
can take advantage of the the

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
recommendations and the information that

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,879
we publish and i'm going to talk a

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,799
little bit more about that later on in

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,720
the presentation today and hopefully

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
there's some stuff that you can use as

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
well

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
and our um our key constituents and

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
partners or stakeholders as we sometimes

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,519
say

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
uh include all of the u.s federal

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,519
government agencies

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
with a few exceptions but the vast

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
majority of the u.s federal government

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
falls under sort of our purview and u.s

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
critical infrastructure

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
and the way we divide up critical

117
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
infrastructure is uh there are 16

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
different sectors within the united

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
states that we are mostly that we're

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
most concerned with those include

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
everything from government facilities

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,919
including like schools to health care

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
and human services like hospitals and

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
hospital networks as well as chemicals

125
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
the chemical sector the energy sector

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
different types of critical

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
manufacturing

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,680
transportation um and uh and various

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
others as you can imagine

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
so it's a very very broad mission uh we

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,680
have a wide scope um a lot of a lot of

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
different you know thousands and

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,320
thousands actually of different

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
organizations that we're trying to help

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
protect from cyber cyber security

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
threats as well as um

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
other types of infrastructure threats i

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
should point out like i'm on the i'm

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
definitely on the cyber security side

140
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
and that's the most important for the

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
talk today obviously but we also do

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
things for infrastructure security like

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
how to secure um federal buildings or

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
how to secure like uh broadly attended

145
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,919
uh widely attended gatherings like um

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,759
like sporting events for example or

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
something that we're also concerned with

148
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
protecting

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
and

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
so that brings us to the number one

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
threat to that critical infrastructure

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,479
that we're concerned with the number one

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
cyber security threat is definitely

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,840
ransomware

155
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
um i even have a colleague who likes to

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
joke that the top three threats to

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
critical infrastructure are ransomware

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ransomware and ransomware

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
that's because it's disruptive by design

160
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,479
when um

161
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,039
other types of cyber threats uh commit a

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
compromise of a critical infrastructure

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
network usually it's not to be

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
disruptive maybe they're trying to steal

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
um you know you know economic

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
intelligence or industrial espionage or

167
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,160
something like that but that doesn't

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
break the infrastructure down it doesn't

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
cause things to fall out of operations

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,560
for for a period of time

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
and uh and that's a huge concern for us

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
because we know

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
um in recent cases we've had uh

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,400
incidents that affect uh energy food and

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
agriculture supply chain and our

176
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
hospital networks and all of those

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
things have led to uh really severe

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,440
costs to our society and our way of life

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,039
you can imagine if certain types of

180
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,199
foods stop becoming available that makes

181
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
it difficult for families to feed

182
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,639
themselves

183
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
when uh the colonial pipeline incident

184
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
occurred

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
in may of this year that was a

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,120
ransomware incident and that um

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,840
that caused severe impacts to the uh to

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,599
the energy supply chain for uh

189
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,280
probably half of the east coast of the

190
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
united states if not more for uh for

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
quite a long period of time and that was

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,759
very difficult for people trying to just

193
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
put gas in their car

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
and also hospital networks is a huge

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
concern if ransomware knocks out a

196
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
single hospital in a region

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
and uh and we're already under pressure

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
from the uh or strain i should say if

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,840
we're already under strain from the

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
pandemic as it's ongoing then you can

201
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
imagine the effects that has on people's

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,960
health because they can't get um

203
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
they can't get access to treatment as

204
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,639
quickly as they would normally because

205
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,319
you've got one hospital that's having to

206
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,560
redirect patients because they can't

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,440
support say imaging is down right or

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
some other function of the hospital

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,199
doesn't work because of ransomware

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
and uh and these attacks are occurring

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,759
all the time there are on a daily basis

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,599
across all different sectors of critical

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
infrastructure and all different sizes

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
of organizations

215
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
um it used to be i think that we

216
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
considered ransomware not as great of a

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
threat as it has been in the last couple

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
of years because ransomware mostly

219
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
targeted smaller organizations and the

220
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,879
amounts of money that were being

221
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,319
demanded were

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,360
um

223
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
were not as not as large as they are now

224
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
so now ransomware is is more disruptive

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
more sophisticated and um

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
and they've gotten uh much more

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
audacious

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,719
in um

229
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,320
in the different types of organizations

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
that they're targeting for uh for

231
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
attacks

232
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
so

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
how do we uh how do we work together to

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
uh to try and defeat ransomware

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
so in the united states we work with

236
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
different agencies throughout the uh

237
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
throughout the government and with our

238
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
private sector partners um especially in

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
the uh in cyber threat intelligence

240
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
uh in the it sector and the telecom

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
sector to uh to combat the threat

242
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
uh

243
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,839
our main partner agencies obviously are

244
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
our law enforcement partners

245
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
they perform investigations and bring

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
charges and try to interdict

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
and disrupt the uh the operations of

248
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
ransomware gangs

249
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,279
um so that would be the federal bureau

250
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,640
investigation

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
as well as the uh

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
united states secret service and then

253
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,680
the treasury department can uh can lay

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,959
sanctions

255
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
against uh against different

256
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,640
um

257
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
recipients of funds which means that uh

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
it becomes illegal to pay those people

259
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
and uh

260
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
and that's another way that we can uh

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,120
possibly disrupt their operations is

262
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
making it illegal to pay them off so

263
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
that there's no way for for them to

264
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
actually collect the ransom

265
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
um we also work with our defense

266
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,080
agencies um diplomatic and intelligence

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
agencies all work together to uh as we

268
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,279
say take the fight to the enemy which is

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,959
to um

270
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,560
to make it clear

271
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,040
to uh to countries that host ransomware

272
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
activity that it's unacceptable to us

273
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
and also where um where possible

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
possibly trying to disrupt their

275
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
infrastructure

276
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
and lastly um

277
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
we uh

278
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
last but not least sizzit is leading the

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
effort to harden the targets for

280
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
ransomware we want to make systems more

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
secure and resilient um and make sure

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
that our critical infrastructure is not

283
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,000
a low-hanging fruit for these criminal

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
gangs that are profit profiting off of

285
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
ransoms

286
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
so now i'm going to go into more detail

287
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
and talk specifically about that effort

288
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
to uh to make systems more secure and

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,560
resilient

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
and uh and walk through some of the

291
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
resources we've already made available

292
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,079
on that front

293
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,760
so this is um this is the main page of

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
our stop ransomware.gov

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
website

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
which has a huge amount of resources

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
available to everyone for free

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
um on

299
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
you know explaining what ransomware is

300
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
obviously um helping people respond to

301
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
ransomware if they've been attacked

302
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
and most importantly helping them

303
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,839
prepare

304
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
and prevent um

305
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
their organization from being

306
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,680
you know hit by ransomware in the first

307
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
place so we have lots of different

308
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
resources available on stop

309
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
ransomware.gov there's um about a

310
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,240
22-page guide that goes into lots of

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
technical information on how to protect

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
your organization from from ransomware

313
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,399
attacks and also includes incident

314
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
response checklists in case the worst

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
case scenario does happen and you are

316
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
affected by ransomware

317
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
there's also specific guides on this

318
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,920
site for different um audiences like

319
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,839
i've already talked uh talked about

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,519
healthcare quite a bit we have a special

321
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
page for healthcare under this site and

322
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
the resources section we have another

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
one for educational organizations

324
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
because we knew that um

325
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
especially when uh

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,760
schools started going to uh mostly

327
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
remote learning during the the worst

328
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
uh phases of the pandemic here

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
um we were concerned that schools were

330
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
going to be hit more often by ransomware

331
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
um and knocked out of operations and we

332
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
uh we wanted to help them protect

333
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
themselves as well

334
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
so there's a ton of resources on this

335
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,160
site

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
um

337
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
i you know if you are concerned about

338
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
ransomware or want to just want to learn

339
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,959
more about how we're dealing with the

340
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
threat i'd advise everyone to try and

341
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
check it out and just browse around or

342
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,920
look use the you know the classic search

343
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
bar to find out if we have anything

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
specific to your industry or sector

345
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
um

346
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,279
next is our bad practices page

347
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
this is um this is something that we

348
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
started uh publishing just very recently

349
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
um and everybody's heard of best

350
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
practices

351
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
uh bad practices are the things that you

352
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
shouldn't do

353
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,800
ever because they're a great way to get

354
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
compromised and it's an extremely short

355
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
list we told ourselves when we started

356
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
publishing the bad practices that we

357
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
wanted to make sure that we didn't get

358
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
to like any more than seven or so

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,040
because we didn't want to overwhelm

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
people with all the things not to do

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
as it stands there's a list of only

362
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
three

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
and i'll tell you right now they're very

364
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
simple the first one is not to use

365
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
unsupported or end-of-life software so

366
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,720
no more on-premise windows windows 2008

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,200
server server we know that the bad guys

368
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
love that sort of thing when they find

369
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,519
it um during the reconnaissance phase

370
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,200
because there's tons of vulnerabilities

371
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,079
that are very easily exploited that way

372
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
um so we want people to try and

373
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,560
eliminate as much and eliminate all of

374
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,079
the end-of-life software in their

375
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
environment um to the greatest extent

376
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
possible and if there is any sort of use

377
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
case where end-of-life software is

378
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
required and we know that those use

379
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
cases do exist in critical

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
infrastructure unfortunately that those

381
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
systems are protected and segmented as

382
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,720
best as possible so in case they are

383
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
compromised it doesn't lead to a

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
compromise of the rest of the network

385
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
the second one the second bad practice

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,680
is no use of default known or

387
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
unchangeable passwords

388
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
um especially for critical systems but

389
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
in any case uh we all know that weak

390
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
passwords are a really bad idea but we

391
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
know that you know

392
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
known default and unchangeable passwords

393
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,199
are still a fact of life in a lot of

394
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
places so we put that on the bad

395
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,800
practices list because again it's

396
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
something that the bad guys know how to

397
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
identify and quickly take advantage of

398
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,600
and then that leads to a compromise of

399
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
your systems and data

400
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,880
and lastly the third bad practice

401
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
is uh is the use of single factor

402
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,279
authentication for remote or

403
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
administrative access

404
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
um and that means basically that

405
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,680
everyone who is um everyone who is using

406
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
remote access should be using some kind

407
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
of token other than just a password uh

408
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
to uh to authenticate and get access to

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
the network

410
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
uh here at the department of homeland

411
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
security which is the uh the parent

412
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
agency of sizza

413
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
um everyone uses a uh

414
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,760
an id an id smart card with their uh

415
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
with their laptop or or derived

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,240
credentials with their mobile devices so

417
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
that everything is um everything has at

418
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
least a second factor of uh not only

419
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
something you know which is your pen but

420
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
also something you have which is your id

421
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
card so that's how we make sure that

422
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
everything is multi-factor for our

423
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
remote access we encourage everybody

424
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
else to do similar

425
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,600
um again in some cases we know none of

426
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
these are necessarily inexpensive

427
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
investments for for people to adopt but

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
we do know that if you don't

429
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
avoid the bad practices again you will

430
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
find yourself compromised uh sooner

431
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,720
rather than later

432
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
um from our own experiences our own

433
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
incident response and uh and as well as

434
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,560
the experience of others that we've

435
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
worked with

436
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,880
um the next thing i want to talk about

437
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
is uh is our alerts

438
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
um we have a system we call the national

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
cyber awareness system which is uh

440
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,639
sort of a combination of uh rss feeds

441
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
social media and uh an email

442
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,639
subscription lists

443
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,399
all of which are ways to get access to

444
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
the same information and these are all

445
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
of the alerts that we publish on various

446
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,639
things here i'm just sharing an alert

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
that we published uh back in october on

448
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
the black matter ransomware

449
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
um

450
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,680
and uh we suspect black matter is

451
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
possibly um

452
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
a rebranding of another ransomware

453
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
family that was involved in uh some

454
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
pretty critical incidents previously

455
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,839
and uh and now we know that this one is

456
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,680
this new rebranded black matter

457
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,199
ransomware has targeted multiple

458
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,160
critical infrastructure entities as well

459
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,040
um

460
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
and uh and so we use these alerts to get

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
the word out and share indicators of

462
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,519
compromise with our partners and all of

463
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
the people who subscribe to them and

464
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
these are freely available to everyone

465
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,079
so i would suggest if you're if you're

466
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,240
interested in getting free public uh

467
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
threat intelligence from sizza or just

468
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,120
having a situational awareness of what

469
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
we're most concerned with on any given

470
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,079
moment

471
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
you can go to our go to our website and

472
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
uh and sign up for these alerts and and

473
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,079
get them however you want the rss or

474
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
email or

475
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,319
just uh just follow our social media but

476
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
we publish a lot of this type of thing

477
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839
just to make sure everybody else can

478
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
stay abreast on uh on the most emerging

479
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,559
threats

480
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
and lastly um and then we're gonna stop

481
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
talking about all the free stuff

482
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
um

483
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
i wanted to share with you this tool

484
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,679
that we've developed and share with

485
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,200
everybody

486
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,720
which is called the cyber security

487
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
evaluation tool that's what the cset

488
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
stands for

489
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,919
and

490
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,600
and the most recent version of it

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
includes a ransomware readiness

492
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
assessment module

493
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
and this is a standalone tool you can

494
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,600
download it and run it whenever you want

495
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
um at your leisure it does not send any

496
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,280
data back to sizza so it you know your

497
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
data that you enter into the assessment

498
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
tool stays private

499
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
um and what it is is basically a

500
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,320
questionnaire

501
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
um you run the assessment answer the

502
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
questions um

503
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
about your own organization and your

504
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
posture and it will feed back to you a

505
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
different set of rec depending on your

506
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
answers it will feed back to you

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,600
recommendations

508
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
on uh

509
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,039
on what you can do to improve your cyber

510
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,280
security posture and better protect your

511
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,280
organization

512
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,039
and so

513
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
that's all of the stuff that we're doing

514
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
to uh to help shore up sort of like the

515
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,480
uh the critical infrastructure in the

516
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
united states

517
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,720
just in uh just sort of independently as

518
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,799
cisa but all of this happens in

519
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
collaboration with our partners like i

520
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,280
said align a lot of these cases when

521
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
we're you know when we're talking about

522
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
what really is the bat what really are

523
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
the bad practices or what should we

524
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
publish in our next alert or where can

525
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
we collect the most you know valuable

526
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
and timely threat intelligence we're

527
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
doing that in partnership with um with

528
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
allies and uh allies around the world um

529
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
and with private sector and with our

530
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
critical infrastructure partners and

531
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
with our sister agencies and with our

532
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
counterpart agencies in other countries

533
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
um we know that we have been able to

534
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
alert potential victims before the

535
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
ransomware

536
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,160
the ransomware fires so to speak or

537
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
detonates

538
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
um so that you can see for example

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
the initial infection or initial

540
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
compromise will call back to a command

541
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,440
and control system

542
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
if we work together we can identify the

543
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,840
command and control callback before the

544
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,679
ransomware itself has been dropped and

545
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,919
detonated and if we're able to do that

546
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
we sometimes have a window of a matter

547
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
of hours

548
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,280
but we can get the word to certain

549
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
organizations

550
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160
before that detonation um period and

551
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
they've been able to protect themselves

552
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
and minimize the impact of the

553
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
ransomware so that's been tremendously

554
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,960
powerful

555
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
um

556
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
we uh again like i said getting this

557
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,799
threat intelligence compiling all this

558
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,640
information and sharing it in a timely

559
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
fashion um all of that is enabled by

560
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,760
uh enabled by partnerships both domestic

561
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,280
and international

562
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
and uh those can be formal organizations

563
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,840
like uh

564
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,679
our information sharing and analysis

565
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,720
centers

566
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
like uh like we have here in the us that

567
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,919
represent each sector um information

568
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,080
sharing and analysis organizations which

569
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
is slightly different um are sanctioned

570
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,000
a little bit differently by the

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
government but perform most of the same

572
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
functions

573
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
um and all of these are sort of formal

574
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
membership organizations usually there's

575
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,000
a

576
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
dues or membership fees

577
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
and you get you know sort of nominated

578
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
into the uh information sharing and

579
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
analysis center by your home

580
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,880
organization that's paying your dues

581
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
um and then there's volunteer groups so

582
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
there can be people who just meet at

583
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,039
conferences like this one right here

584
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,159
today and form slack channels or form uh

585
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,320
uh form mailing lists

586
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,600
or uh

587
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
you know whatever your communication uh

588
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
your communication channel of choice is

589
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
and then share in threat intelligence

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
and answer each other's questions and

591
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
tackle the bad guys together that way so

592
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
there's many different ways to um many

593
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
different ways to collaborate we try to

594
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
leverage um as many of them as we

595
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,559
possibly can within the bounds of the uh

596
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
within the bounds of the law as you can

597
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
imagine

598
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,720
and uh

599
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,039
and uh encourage you to also like join

600
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,760
your local trust groups uh participate

601
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
in your information sharing and analysis

602
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
centers or the uh the counterparts to

603
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
those in in your countries

604
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,159
and uh

605
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
and work with us

606
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200
so

607
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,799
that is um

608
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
that concludes my prepared remarks for

609
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
today

610
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,919
um i'm sorry if i went through that a

611
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
little bit quickly but i wanted to save

612
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,000
a lot of time for question and answer

613
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
so thank you again for having me this

614
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,559
has been an honor to uh to speak today

615
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
and um and really looking forward to

616
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,159
your questions

617
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,039
thank you again okay yeah so um thanks

618
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,880
again um um thomas for coming on the uh

619
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,440
thanksgiving uh night yep um

620
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
okay

621
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,120
now what is

622
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,039
so i have one question

623
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,919
so

624
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,720
uh

625
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
just now you mentioned uh one of the

626
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,320
most important thing about the bad

627
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
practices is to run legacy softwares

628
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,520
like windows server 2008 or

629
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
those software that's not supported but

630
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
i think one of the issues that um i've

631
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
seen with some of these uh critical

632
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
infrastructure is that those critical

633
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
infrastructures are underfunded so

634
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
there's a problem uh whereby

635
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
we have a hard time trying to convince

636
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
them to kind of migrate from these

637
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,240
systems and um sometimes these systems

638
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,080
are running a lot of their

639
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,559
um are tangled with their the rest of

640
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,159
their infrastructure so

641
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,880
it can be pretty difficult to or costly

642
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
to do so um what's kind of the the

643
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,240
general strategy um for those especially

644
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
for the private entities whereby we

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
cannot just like fund them directly

646
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,600
so one thing we have um

647
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,158
and uh

648
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
this is a little this is going to be a i

649
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,720
realize you know we have we have uh we

650
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
have a lot of different people in the

651
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
audience here today but uh pretend this

652
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
is kind of an off the record uh off the

653
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
cuff remark one thing we have started

654
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
talking about a little bit within within

655
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,240
sizza

656
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,919
is whether it would help for us to have

657
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,919
a grant-making authority

658
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,400
um so that we could provide different

659
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
organizations with um

660
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
with funds to um to improve that

661
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
situation unfortunately i don't think

662
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
that solves like just having the money

663
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
doesn't always solve the problem because

664
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,919
uh it can be a big supply chain problem

665
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,520
i have a

666
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
i have a friend of mine who works at a

667
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,679
at an academic institution

668
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,240
who is just now um telling me he was

669
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
trying to install

670
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,760
some completely unsupported version of

671
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,200
windows on onto a machine

672
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
um

673
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
specifically because it was connected to

674
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
a milling station

675
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
so it works in like the architecture

676
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
school and they use a lot of different

677
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,799
milling they use actual industrial

678
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
control systems there

679
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,279
um uh to teach the students how to

680
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
interact with different types of uh

681
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
um like metal working tools and blades

682
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,679
and things of that nature

683
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,279
so he's working he's gotta install

684
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
windows

685
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
i can't remember which version but it's

686
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,440
way out of date and um and it's only

687
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,679
because it the the software to run the

688
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,279
mill or the lathe

689
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
only works on that version of windows

690
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
and we know this is just a microcosm

691
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
of what the situation is like in

692
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,080
critical infrastructure because it's not

693
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
enough to say you know like oh you have

694
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,279
to invest in this

695
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
it's like can you really replace the

696
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,159
machinery

697
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,559
and you may even have machinery

698
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,640
that no longer you know is no longer

699
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
supported with uh with modern software

700
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,039
just because of the supply chain for

701
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,360
these devices and how things get you

702
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
know companies get bought

703
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,679
or uh or you know they get involved in

704
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,679
mergers all this all this sort of stuff

705
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,400
changes about the economics of uh of

706
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,480
software and and what has to work with

707
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
what

708
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
um

709
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
so just having just being able to throw

710
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
money at the problem

711
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,520
doesn't necessarily uh

712
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,080
doesn't necessarily solve the issue

713
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
um

714
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,080
what we wanted to do when we published

715
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
that bad practice though what we really

716
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
wanted to to

717
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,559
to start was

718
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,320
start to have that difficult

719
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,919
conversation

720
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,919
about you know like why is there so much

721
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,760
unsupported software especially in

722
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,159
critical infrastructure and what are the

723
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,000
uh what are the investment decisions

724
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
that need to be made to change that um

725
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
and where do they belong in the supply

726
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
chain one of the other effects we wanted

727
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
to have with that with that bad practice

728
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
was to have a conversation with uh cyber

729
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,919
security insurers

730
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,720
so like say if a cyber security

731
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,960
insurance you you ask a cyber security

732
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
insurance company for a policy

733
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
and uh and then they find out you're

734
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
running a lot of unsupported software

735
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,799
then that you know that might create um

736
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,360
additional costs for your policy or you

737
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,559
might be deemed uninsurable period

738
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,960
and that turns um that turns investment

739
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,120
decisions around very quickly right

740
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
because you think oh i can offset risk

741
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,760
by buying cyber security insurance

742
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
go find out because we run so much

743
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
unsupported software the cyber security

744
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,480
insurance is now very expensive well we

745
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,640
could save money on this investment to

746
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
buy down risk by buying down risk in

747
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
other places

748
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
so those are the conversations we were

749
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,520
trying to start and it is a very

750
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
difficult

751
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,279
um i guess this long rambling answer is

752
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,880
just a way of saying like it's a very

753
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
difficult complex thing

754
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
we tried to boil it down to one bad

755
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,559
practice though to start that

756
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,640
conversation about how to solve that uh

757
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
difficult problem

758
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
okay cool so um

759
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,559
uh the general idea is that uh it is a

760
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,559
difficult problem and um we can't just

761
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,640
throw money at it and we try to set the

762
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,520
right incentives like um having higher

763
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,600
insurance premiums for

764
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
for um

765
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,559
organizations that run these um

766
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
legacy software so that's kind of the

767
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
general idea right

768
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
that's right

769
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
um

770
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,799
she's doing a bad practice joe

771
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,799
um

772
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,080
here is the question this is a required

773
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,760
agency or sectors to patch nearly three

774
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,039
or three countries vulnerabilities

775
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,320
how could you

776
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,120
how could cesar make sure the the sector

777
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,880
the government sectors or agencies

778
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,520
already patched these vulnerabilities

779
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,799
so uh we have some visibility into the

780
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,159
uh the operating system status of uh of

781
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
at least the parts of the federal

782
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
government that we're tasked with uh

783
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,799
securing

784
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,399
um

785
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,240
so

786
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
everybody every government agency runs

787
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,000
its own i.t

788
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,279
um but we uh we have visibility into

789
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,440
different uh host-based agents that tell

790
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
us the status of at least some of the uh

791
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,799
some of the endpoints in their networks

792
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,559
so we have some visibility into their

793
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,159
patch status that way

794
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
the other way main way that we uh

795
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,159
determine we determine whether they're

796
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,840
uh whether they've patched according to

797
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,200
our directions

798
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,919
is uh is simple attestation

799
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,399
so we will just do a data call we just

800
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,919
ask the question have you know like

801
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
report the number of systems or the

802
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,679
percentage of systems that have been

803
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,039
patched and uh and they have to tell us

804
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,399
and um

805
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,440
the uh the enforcement of this

806
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
is not done by cesar per se it's

807
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,919
actually done by the inspector general

808
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,679
of that agency

809
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,919
which um which actually gives it a

810
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,720
little bit more uh more weight

811
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,159
because uh you can't run from the

812
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,159
expense inspector general and they will

813
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,559
publish what they find if they if it

814
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
turns out

815
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,480
hey hello can you hear me

816
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,279
yeah uh thank you your talk is very

817
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,320
impressive

818
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
um but i'm very interesting about the

819
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,840
ransomware because

820
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
many taiwan vendor is also being

821
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,000
compromised by the ransomware group

822
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
and in the past we saw that

823
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,880
law enforcement may be useless

824
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
in the case of rainsongwear because they

825
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,480
may not locate it in u.s or taiwan so

826
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
our law enforcement may not have the

827
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
power to take down lamb but however

828
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,640
recently we have noticed that many

829
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,880
groups like the black matter is being

830
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,159
shut down

831
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,519
and

832
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,760
it may because some pressure from the

833
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,320
u.s law enforcement government so i

834
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,679
would like to know

835
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,640
why uh u.s government and maybe see sisa

836
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
take important role here that can take

837
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,320
down

838
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
this ransomware group and why see

839
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
suspicious position

840
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,279
when we do this take down operation

841
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,480
yes thank you

842
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
can um

843
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,200
the microphone was a little bit

844
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
distorted on that question

845
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,200
can uh can i get a repeat or

846
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,159
uh

847
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:30,880
okay

848
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,120
or yeah or generally uh what he's asking

849
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,720
is um how does the u.s uh like just now

850
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
he mentioned that uh

851
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,440
um

852
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
the the threat actors are not in in

853
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
taiwan or in the u.s so he's wondering

854
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
how the u.s took down those um

855
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,919
ransomware threat actors uh that's the

856
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,440
okay yeah that's what he's asking

857
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,440
um

858
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,039
all right well so

859
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,919
generally uh we will for takedowns which

860
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,320
scissor scissors role in a takedown is

861
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
to do victim notification um for um

862
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,159
organizations that are already infected

863
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,760
with the the malicious code that we're

864
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,120
concerned about

865
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,840
but

866
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,760
we work very closely in coordination

867
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
with our partners who are usually

868
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,080
a combination of law enforcement and

869
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,360
private sector

870
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,519
um when a takedown occurs

871
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,919
so in most of the cases where we've done

872
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,200
takedowns

873
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,240
it's become it's be because of uh the

874
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,039
fbi working together with private sector

875
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,200
in very close coordination

876
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,240
um where both both organized both the

877
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,799
private sector side and the fbi will

878
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,200
have access to um to specific

879
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,120
information that's really key

880
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,279
and uh and they share that information

881
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,120
and coordinate when they want to do the

882
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
takedown

883
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,279
and then uh on a particular

884
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,039
particular date and hour when they've

885
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,360
decided they can uh they can seize all

886
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
of the evidence that they want to uh to

887
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,559
make the case

888
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
um

889
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
excuse me

890
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
we uh

891
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,679
we uh they they i should say big we not

892
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,480
not sizza but they the uh the law

893
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,640
enforcement agencies especially with uh

894
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,960
the cooperation of interpol for example

895
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
or europol

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,519
um go in and uh

897
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,919
seize the evidence that the need um and

898
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,640
uh disrupt the infrastructure

899
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,559
it's it's basically it's a combination

900
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,159
of usually of private sector and law

901
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,559
enforcement agencies and then sizza is

902
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
basically um doing

903
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,039
domestic victim notification that's all

904
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,080
we do

905
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,360
i see

906
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,679
yeah i understand thank you and the

907
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,600
other small question is that the sysa

908
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
has a project called stop ransomware and

909
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
we also know the layer on the other

910
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,159
group like a normal ransom so what do

911
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
you think what's the difference between

912
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,480
these two group

913
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,440
yeah

914
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,919
it's clear

915
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
i think you're holding i think you might

916
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
be holding the microphone a little too

917
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,919
close to code okay

918
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,719
yeah is that better

919
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
oh yes

920
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,119
yeah my question is that

921
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,119
i know seesaw has a project called stop

922
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,560
ransomware

923
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
and

924
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,918
we also know that the other group lies

925
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,960
called normal ransom and i wonder

926
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
what's the difference

927
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,159
in your opinion between these two group

928
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,280
um well stop ransomware is our is our

929
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,599
page mostly for resources to help you

930
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
prevent and respond

931
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,320
um

932
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
no more ransom is uh largely a group of

933
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,679
it's got europol involvement so there

934
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,760
are government agencies involved

935
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,599
but it's largely a group of private

936
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,480
sector uh partnerships working together

937
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,159
and they are sharing

938
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,520
um my understanding of no more ransom is

939
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
that their main goal is to share as many

940
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,640
decryption keys as possible so that if

941
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
you are victimized by ransomware you can

942
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,280
visit no warmer nomoreransom.org

943
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,320
and hopefully get the decryption key

944
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
um if it's already known

945
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
and then you know you render the attack

946
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
uh you can just decrypt all of your data

947
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
that way

948
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,720
but

949
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,560
the thing about publish the thing about

950
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
the uh

951
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,839
the adversaries in this case is that

952
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,839
they know they watch no more ransom and

953
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,200
they know when their keys have been

954
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,960
published

955
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
so it's it's kind of a

956
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,920
you know it's a it's a constant struggle

957
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
to try and stay ahead of them as soon as

958
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
you know like we publish keys and they

959
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
change their keys and it's it's never

960
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
ending that way

961
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,280
but i admire i admire the work that

962
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,240
they're doing and uh and

963
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,160
i think the only i think the only reason

964
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,560
that um we have not i'm

965
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,839
actually you know what i'm not really

966
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,160
sure what why there's not like a direct

967
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,839
partnership between what we're doing on

968
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,200
stop ransomware.gov and

969
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
netmoreransom.org

970
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
yeah okay thanks

971
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
okay um thanks um

972
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
uh

973
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,680
so um one of the

974
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
issue with the cryptocurrency or

975
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,160
ransomware is that uh the the ransoms

976
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,839
are paid through cryptocurrency and

977
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,280
there are advancements in the

978
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,920
cryptocurrency space for instance uh

979
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,160
right now most of them demands bit uh

980
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,440
bitcoins um and bitcoin is traceable so

981
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,119
that that makes law enforcement much

982
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,160
easier but there are um

983
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
more anonymous or um

984
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,760
uh currencies like monero available so

985
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,880
um if uh say the threat actors say they

986
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,640
switched to this sort of uh more uh less

987
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,599
traceable um cryptocurrencies for their

988
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,920
say ransomware operations uh what do you

989
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,079
think is the um

990
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,800
uh best response um

991
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,330
in in this kind of situations

992
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,160
[Music]

993
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,079
i can't very i can't speak to that very

994
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,480
well unfortunately um i wish i did have

995
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,280
more more uh detailed knowledge of that

996
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
aspect

997
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
of countering ransomware and disrupting

998
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,599
their operations but that um

999
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,160
those issues uh fall almost entirely

1000
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
into the uh

1001
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,280
under the responsibilities of our law

1002
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,440
enforcement partners and uh and the

1003
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
treasury department

1004
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,720
that's not like scissor doesn't

1005
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,520
typically um concern itself with i mean

1006
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,839
we just tell everybody to not pay

1007
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,440
that's the official u.s government

1008
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,599
policy is to recommend everybody do not

1009
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,520
pay the ransom

1010
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
and that's why stop ransomware.gov is

1011
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,000
full of so much advice on how to make

1012
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
sure that you've got offline backups so

1013
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
that you can restore yourself back to

1014
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,839
operations without having to worry about

1015
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,359
paying the ransom

1016
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,000
um so we're not too concerned we don't

1017
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
concern ourselves too much with the the

1018
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,000
aspects of how they're trying to

1019
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,640
monetize this we want to prevent the uh

1020
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,160
we want to prevent the harm from being

1021
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
done in the first place or minimize the

1022
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,760
harm by making sure everybody has a

1023
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,720
great incident response plan

1024
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,079
i see so um from a seesaw standpoint

1025
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,400
the primary goal is to uh for to

1026
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,240
reinforce maybe recommend um preventive

1027
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,200
measures and to guide

1028
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,240
the victims if they if they get hacked

1029
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
but not deal with the uh investigations

1030
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
or law enforcement

1031
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
right if you think about it um

1032
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,520
one metaphor we like to use where for

1033
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,640
our incident response work is that um

1034
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,440
uh we are we're more like the emergency

1035
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,040
emergency services in the fire

1036
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,240
department

1037
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,160
um we show up and we want to make sure

1038
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
that everybody is safe and sound and uh

1039
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
and can get out of the building and with

1040
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,240
you know with all of their loved ones

1041
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400
and everybody survives we don't care too

1042
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,720
much about who did it there's police

1043
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
that show up and that would be our

1044
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,000
partners in the fbi and they're very

1045
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,680
concerned with who did it who's

1046
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
responsible how they're going to build

1047
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
the case and make sure that it never and

1048
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
make sure that they can't get away with

1049
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,880
it so they don't do it again but we're

1050
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
just we're there to make sure everybody

1051
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
is safe and sound so that's the

1052
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
difference in our responsibilities when

1053
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
it comes to incident response

1054
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,800
that's a very very very good analogy i

1055
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,880
think a lot of people will understand

1056
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,640
better that way yeah so

1057
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,160
um

1058
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,440
so there's a question from one of our um

1059
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,680
online participants um

1060
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,480
and um the question is um

1061
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,440
uh in in in taiwan or us we frequently

1062
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,040
get hacked by

1063
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,160
um

1064
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,920
one of the uh

1065
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
state actors um but i'm not gonna name

1066
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,800
the country to avoid being too too

1067
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,599
political and um what's what's the

1068
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,520
general um

1069
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,720
directions or guidance on how to prevent

1070
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,078
those um state actor hacking incidents

1071
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,480
um

1072
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,960
i'll have to say this right the thing is

1073
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
is that

1074
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,680
persist the reason they're called

1075
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,839
advanced persistent threats

1076
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,440
are the reason we started calling them

1077
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,160
that and uh and i don't think

1078
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,920
scissor came up with that term that was

1079
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
a that was an industry term and then we

1080
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,440
just sort of adopted it

1081
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,319
um

1082
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,760
but the reason they're called that is

1083
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
because they they do use sophisticated

1084
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,960
tools but most importantly they are very

1085
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,319
persistent

1086
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,839
and um and based on our experience the

1087
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,440
thing is is that

1088
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,520
they they uh

1089
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,760
we know from defending our own agencies

1090
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,920
against these types of

1091
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,119
nation-state-sponsored intrusions

1092
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,040
that if uh

1093
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
if these types of threats want to get

1094
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,359
into an agency and find that data they

1095
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,280
will spend enough time

1096
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,440
to uh they will spend long enough to

1097
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,920
where they will gain that access

1098
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,400
the uh the most important thing in most

1099
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,480
cases is to detect it as quickly as

1100
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
possible

1101
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,640
and then uh share that information and

1102
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
eradicate their access as quickly as

1103
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,000
possible so it's really about um

1104
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,760
for those types of compromises i don't

1105
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
think prevention is always like

1106
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,079
making it difficult is is important um

1107
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,240
but prevention is extremely hard because

1108
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,599
of how much time they're willing to

1109
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,560
spend

1110
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
um you know

1111
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
working on phishing your um staff and

1112
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,760
employees um working on you know like

1113
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,440
waiting for that one moment when you

1114
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
aren't patched and there's a new zero

1115
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,200
day that's floating around in the wild

1116
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,000
um developing their own zero days that

1117
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
is another thing that's extremely

1118
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
difficult to defend against so all of

1119
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,079
these things stack in their favor but

1120
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
the main thing is they they want access

1121
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,160
for long periods of time that's why they

1122
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
do these uh these intrusions because

1123
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,319
they uh they want to compromise you and

1124
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,079
use you for you know use your networks

1125
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,520
for their own intelligence gathering

1126
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,640
purposes

1127
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,119
um or to uh

1128
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,599
you know to pre-position malware for you

1129
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,359
know possibly other purposes down the

1130
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,359
line but if you can detect it and

1131
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,839
eradicate it in a in a quick fashion

1132
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,280
then that renders all of their

1133
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
investment uh you know more or less

1134
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
worthless

1135
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,319
so i think uh

1136
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,000
i think that's the real lesson to learn

1137
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,280
here from what we've what we've

1138
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,680
experienced um helping defend our own

1139
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,359
agencies here in the united states

1140
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,440
and that's why we do uh that's why we do

1141
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
a lot of those hunt engagements where we

1142
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,920
just assume there's already a compromise

1143
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,599
and we go in looking for it so we can

1144
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,400
eradicate it um eradicate it from the

1145
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
network okay cool that's a

1146
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,160
very different perspective than well um

1147
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,960
because i think a lot of the mindsets is

1148
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,040
to kind of prevent these hacks but

1149
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,760
that's a very interesting um kind of way

1150
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,680
to view it is to get them out if they

1151
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
get in instead of like trying to stop

1152
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,880
them from getting in at all

1153
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,119
um

1154
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,920
so i think we're about time so um let's

1155
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
uh end here and then uh let's uh thank

1156
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,640
uh thomas again uh with a round of

1157
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,470
applause

1158
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,600
[Music]

1159
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,839
um thanks

1160
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,640
no thank you this was this was fun i had

1161
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,640
fun
