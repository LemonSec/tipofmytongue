after this talk okay progress

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
i'll do a presentation as soon as

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,200
possible

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
okay

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
so thank you for giving uh

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
thank you for you you're giving a great

45
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,319
opportunity for me to share our view

46
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,200
about the recent cyber security issue

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
and what kind of effort we're doing in

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
japan

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
especially i would like to emphasize on

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
the importance of the collective

51
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
collaborative activities for cyber

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,519
security

53
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,879
because

54
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,680
the

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
as you know the cyber attack is becoming

56
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
more and more sophisticated and smart

57
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
smarter and smarter

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
so the attackers try to find

59
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
vulnerability in the weakest point in

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
supply chain

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
so

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
in japan and i think the

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
in taiwan

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
also the many big companies has already

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
introduced a very high level of cyber

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,440
security messages

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,239
and

68
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,720
they can they have already introduced a

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
sock system

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
and a special game

71
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,440
for cyber security inside the company

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
they do they have already made a big

73
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
effort to manage to protect themselves

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,840
from sophisticated cyber attacks but

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
actually

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
the attackers are trying to find an

77
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
entrance point to the big company

78
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
that's a small

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,080
medium sized company smu is

80
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
in japan we had a very interesting

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,359
survey in 2018

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
all second chamber of commerce regional

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
chamber commerce

84
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,600
conducted a very interesting survey

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,320
to

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
smus

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
all second chamber of commerce made a

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
partnership with university of kobe

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
to give special monitoring services

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,199
for

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,400
30

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,198
smes

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,639
during 3 months in 2018

94
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
all 30

95
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
smes

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
receive serious cyber tax

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
and

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
5

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
from 30 companies

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,720
received serious damage

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
and became became

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
the attacking point

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,919
to

104
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,840
partner

105
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
just a big companies

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
that's a reality

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
and

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
after the survey

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
also chamber of commerce wanted to know

110
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
what kind of reality they are facing

111
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
especially the end big enterprises are

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
facing were facing

113
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
and

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,039
they gave

115
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
this

116
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
they tried to receive the anchor

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
from

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
100

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
big companies

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
in

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
kansai area

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
and one fourth

123
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,840
25 percent of the

124
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
companies received serious

125
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
damage

126
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
from

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
by the attack

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
from part as a chrome exam is

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,479
poor partner of big

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
enterprises

131
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
it may

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,160
roam that survey surrounds this service

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
we have already seen

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,199
smus has already become the attacking

135
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,080
point to big enterprises

136
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
for

137
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,639
cyber

138
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
criminal prayers that's reality

139
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
because of their

140
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
individual activities for cyber security

141
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
is not enough to protect our supply

142
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
chains our society

143
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,120
that's the first point we should start

144
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
talk about cyber security that's our

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
understanding

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,520
we have already

147
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
had a various kind of the frameworks or

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
guidelines for cyber security for

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,479
example

150
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,680
iso 27

151
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,199
27001 to

152
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,240
nest

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
cyber security framework by

154
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
u.s nist

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
all these kind of

156
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
the framework and guidelines for cyber

157
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
security

158
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
are good

159
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,440
for especially individual entities but

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
these framework and

161
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,199
guidelines

162
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
will not work well

163
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,000
for

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
promote promotion of

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,319
collaborative activities

166
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,360
so far

167
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
we have only

168
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
cyber security tools for individual

169
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
entities

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,599
because of that

171
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,479
making my organization and my division

172
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
decided to introduce a new type

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
framework for cyber security to promote

174
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
collaborative activities that's a

175
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
cyber physical security framework cpsl

176
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
we spent all

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
one and a half year to introduce the

178
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240

two times public comment

181
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,919
not only in japanese battles in english

182
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,039
and there we release the version 1.0

we received thousands of comments not

187
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,479
only from japan but also outside japan

188
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,199
like the united states and the european

helpful comment

193
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,040
on draft on the draft of cpsf we

194
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
reflected all this kind of positive

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,839
comment on cpsf because of that

196
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,120
cpsa has already become one of the major

197

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
has already been used by many big

204
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760

210
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
in building area there are various kind

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
just started

267
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
to talk

268
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
to how to make

269
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
their specific cyber physical security

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
guidelines based on cpsf for space

271
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
related industries so all these kind of

272
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
activities

273
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
all industries

274

have just started

276
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
in each sector to introduce such a kind

277
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
of sector specific guidelines based on

278

cpsf

279
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
and basically on cpsf we also introduce

280

that's a

285
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,880
iot that

286
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,639
iot security safety framework we named

288
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,240
covered

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,160
the all iot area how to set

290
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
the security messages

291
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
for each

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
iot

293
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
products

294
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,000
we gave the

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
conceptual framework

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
how to

297
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
sync the risk

298
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,320
and measures for iot

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
and we

300
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
will

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
release

302
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
we will release a data management

303
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
framework based on cpsa maybe in the

304
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
first of next year

305
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
we have already finished the public

306
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,600
comments not only in japanese but also

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
in english

308
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
for

309
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
the draft of data management framework

310
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
you can see the draft of data management

framework

312
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
we would like to use data management

313
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
framework as a major than the reference

314
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,760
to build a true data free

315

317
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
based on data management framework all

318
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
these kind of activities we are doing

319
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,079
now

320
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
and also

321

these two

322
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
are helping

323

japanese industries

324
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,959
to strengthen their capability for cyber

325
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
security but

326
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,519
we also to promote actual activity

327
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,040
for industries

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
first point

329
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,839
we talk with japan

330
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,560
many japanese business associations to

331
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
let them make some kind of partnership

332
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,000
by themselves by themselves and

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
eventually

334
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
japanese measure three business

335
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
associations

336
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,639
took leadership to launch

337
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,000
supply chain cyber security consortium

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360

356
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
to share the what kind of efforts they

357
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
should do and what kind of partnership

358
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,560
they should build

359
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
now

360
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,670
they are focusing on the

361
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,279
[Music]

362
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,160
three major

363
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
topics first

364
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,519
to support the same with cyber security

365
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,199
second

366
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
to make

367
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,279
two strings in the partnership between

368
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,199
academia and industry for cyber security

369
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,680
and to promote the cyber security effort

370
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,000
not only in ireland area but also

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,560
regional area

372
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
and

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,639
also they are trying to share what kind

374
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
of cyber incident happened and what kind

375
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,160
of measures will work well for companies

376
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
through

377
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,759
surprising cyber security consortium

378
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,560
industries

379
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
are sharing the best practices

380
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
and to strengthen the partnership

381
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,600
between

382
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,399
enterprises

383
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
even

384
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,199
we

385
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
are making this kind of effort

386
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,560
frankly speaking it's not enough because

387
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,959
we need to protect smooth

388
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,639
that's a big big challenge frankly

389
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
speaking and i frequently talk with

390
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,519
american friends and european friends

391
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
and the israeli friends how to protect

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
smes because to protect our supply chain

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
we need to

394
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,040
strengthen the capability or for cyber

395
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,399
security

396
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
on smes but on the other hand as you

397
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,639
know

398
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
sm is capacity and capability

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
uh so limited

400
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,480
it's not enough to add a special

401
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
capability for cyber security

402
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
for smes

403
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
that's a big big challenge because of

404
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,438
that

405
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,599
four years ago

406
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
i started talking with

407
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
insurance company

408
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,160
i asked insurance company to

409
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,400
prepare the special

410
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,439
insurance

411
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,199
cyber security insurance for smes

412
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
at that time four years ago

413
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,559
insurance companies mentioned to me they

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
wanted but

415
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
they didn't have enough data to

416
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
architect to

417
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
design the appropriate cyber security

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
insurance for smes

419
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
what kind of corporates say that israel

420
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,919
should have

421
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
premium how much

422
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
all these kind of data

423
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
they did they didn't have at that time

424
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
because of that

425
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,600
in japan

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,039
we launched

427
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
national project

428
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,440
to make

429
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,559
cyber security insurance for smes during

430
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,799
two years

431
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,600
we succeeded in gathering very good data

432
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
and a good marriage for insurance

433
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,520
companies insurance company

434
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
made a partnership with

435
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
security vendors

436
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,520
and the regional chamber of commerce to

437
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,919
make appropriate marketing

438
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
to smash users

439
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,679
and from this april

440
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
these insurance company groups succeeded

441
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,720
in starting commercial

442
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
services

443
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
they start sharing

444
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
cyber security

445
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
insurance for smes

446
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
we named

447
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
cyber security savers

448
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
such activities are so

449
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
cutting-edge activities wrongly speaking

450
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,280
but we anyway we succeeded in study

451
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
american friends

452
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
european friends australian friends and

453
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
especially israeli friends showed strong

454
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
interest especially the insurance

455
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,200
services because israeli government also

456
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
has the same idea how to use the

457
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
insurance company to involve the cyber

458
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
security activities

459
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,600
they also had a similar kind of concept

460
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,480
but

461
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,400
they have not yet succeeded involving

462
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
insurance companies because of that i

463
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
shared my experience

464
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
with this very friend we are very

465
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
glad to share our experience with our

466
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,679
friends

467
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,480
and

468
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,760
also

469
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
i would like to

470
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
i would like to point out the importance

471
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
of industrial control security things as

472
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
well

473
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
to protect critical infrastructure

474
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,159
not only information

475
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
system security but also industrial

476
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
control system security is very critical

477
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
it's very very critical frankly speaking

478
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
specialists for industrial control

479
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,799
system securities

480
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
are so limited not only in japan but

481
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
also all over the world even in the

482
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,400
united states even in the israel

483
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
the species for industrial control

484
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,559
system security

485
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
are so limited because

486
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
in japan

487
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,440
we

488
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
launched a special center of excellence

489
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
we named

490
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,840
industrial cyber security center of

491
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,320

coe

497
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
we give a special one-year training call

498
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
to specialist

499

501
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,520
one year training is very very

502
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
workable

503
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
it's very effective

504
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,200
after the end of training

505
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
more about cyber security from

546
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,600
specialized over the world

547
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,960

our effort is not is apparent

549
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
prematurely concretely speaking cyber

550
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,080
attack is becoming more and more

551
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
sophisticated and more aggressive

552
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
we need to make

553
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
more effort to protect our separating

554
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
our society

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
kind of framework developed by uh your

576
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
team right

577
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
so how how to like um how to develop

578
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
such a framework in how many um

579
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
like like efforts uh and what is the

580
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
challenge of uh developing such

581
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
framework

582
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
thank you very much that's a very

583
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,840
interesting question

584
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,120
actually the cps is a very huge

585
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
structure and i recommend you all to

586
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,039
actually

587
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,919
read

588
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
cpsf itself you will be able to find cps

589
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,640
in english in website and

590
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,039
actually to

591
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,400
make a basic concept

592
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
my team around my team

593
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
i give the basic concept to my team

594
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,440
the in cpsf there are three layers to

595
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
articulate a risk point

596
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,279
in cyber physical integrated society

597
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,200
three layer and six elements for supply

598
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
chain that's a basic concept i give the

599
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,960
concept

600
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
and my team member

601
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
three members

602
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
give some kind of component but on the

603
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,559
other hand it's not enough we also need

604
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
to study

605
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,840
other

606
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,159
countries

607
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,360
standards

608
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,400
framework guidelines over the world and

609
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
because of that

610
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
we

611
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
give up

612
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,720
we made a partnership with one company

613
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,679
to make a draft of gps the first draft

614
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,880
around

615
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
30 or 40 pages like that

616
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,440
then

617
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,039
i gave this

618
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,400
guy

619
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,640
we gave the draft of the cpsa to our

620
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,919
study group

621
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,440
we gathered the

622
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
major

623
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
industries and academia people around 20

624
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,799
people

625
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,360
then we receive they re-saturate the

626
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
draft of the first draft of the cpsa in

627
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,279
the study group and we receive the comma

628
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,240
and we improve the draft of the cps is

629
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,600
that the second

630
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
drug

631
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,080
then

632
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,440
we give

633
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,240
we conducted a public comment

634
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,279
on second director of cpsf not only in

635
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,840
japanese but also in english

636
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,919
and fortunately we have very close

637
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,919
relationship with especially american

638
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,039
friends because

639
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,360
i was stationed in the united states

640
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
there are a lot of friends we i have in

641
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,399
not only governmental side but also

642
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,000
industry side and we shared the the

643
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
second draft of the cpss to american

644
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,919
friends first grade and

645
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
governmental people gave the comment and

646
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,559
also many major jobs and companies like

647
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
microsoft says

648
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
they gave the big help support for us

649
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,559
in the case of microsoft they

650
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,440
saturate the second draft of cpsf not

651
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,399
only in the engineer in the united

652
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,240
states but also all over the world the

653
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,640
work for microsoft

654
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
they

655
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
they gave the very sophisticated

656
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,919
comments

657
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,440
for us

658
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
through the public comments of course

659
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,960
the european friends also gave the

660
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,799
especially german friends has a very

661
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,159
good sense about especially iot area

662
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,720
manufacturing iot area their comment

663
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,360
also so

664
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
helpful

665
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,000
so meaningful so that we reflected all

666
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,080
those kind of comments

667
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,679
on the third draft of gps and the third

668
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,320
draft of cpss became over 100 pages and

669
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,200
also

670
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,520
we give correspondent table between cpsf

671
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,559
and iso 270012

672
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,000
cpsf

673
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
and

674
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,640
nist cyber security framework cpsf and

675
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,370
sp 800 171 all these kind of major

676
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,159
[Music]

677
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,520
standards we covered in cpsf you can see

678
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,000
the corresponding table with all these

679
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,039
major

680
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,720
standards the we made this kind of thing

681
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
so that many people

682
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,559
during this process frankly speaking

683
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,559
over the thousands of engineers actually

684
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,360
involved into these activities through

685
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
public comment because we

686
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,039
conducted two times public comment and

687
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,200
the major companies

688
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
calculated the draft of the cpsf to

689
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,520
all engineers not only in japan but also

690
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
outside japan and in the case of the

691
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,240
united states not only

692
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,640
the engineering use the united states

693
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
but also the other area japan the asia

694
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,960
and europe

695
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,279
we succeeded in

696
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,320
corrected all this kind of

697
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
diverse

698
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
diverse view

699
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
on cpsl

700
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,840
because of that we spent over one and a

701
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,880
half years a relatively long time we use

702
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
but

703
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,960
we succeeded in

704
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
making a very good

705
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
framework i think so
