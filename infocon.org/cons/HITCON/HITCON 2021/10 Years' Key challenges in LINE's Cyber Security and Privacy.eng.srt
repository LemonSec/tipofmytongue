00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
this is

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
lions mission

46
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
that means bringing together the

47
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,680
information services and people to get

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,720
them closer and closer

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,239
this is the dynamic user base

50
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,000
for line

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,280
we have

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,879
189 million in global

53
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,879
mau

54
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,200
uh

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
in japan we have 89 million in taiwan 21

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,239
million of thailand 52 million

57
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
and for these three countries

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,760
uh almost more than seven percent

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159
mau

60
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
population

61
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
especially in taiwan it's over

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,319
it's almost 90 percent

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
this is a history of line

64
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,280
in 2011

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
we have launched the line

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
after that

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
we release

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
line pay line global blockchain

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
and line bank thailand and taiwan and

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
also in the media

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
and line bank japan will be coming soon

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
in the

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,239
next year

74
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
uh line services could be

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,919
a part of our daily life

76
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,560
currently called

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
life online this is a concept a story of

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
one day of your life

79
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,440
for example

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
uh when you get up in the morning the

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
first thing to do might be

82
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
checking the news by using live news

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
online today

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,000
and all the pizza delivery for lunch and

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,840
time with uh the maicom japan orlando

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,080
thailand

87
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
and get get coupon from official

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,759
accounts

89
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
and

90
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
get shopping using line pay

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
and enjoy music with live music or line

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
tv of taiwan thailand on the way back

93
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
home after work

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
in such a day of life

95
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
we could say that

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
this user could spend

97
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,639
um much time of daily life in some of

98
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
line services

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,240
this is the concept of life online

100
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,280
it is also natural to say that line is

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
expected

102
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,198
uh

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
to provide safety service that protect

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
and handle the user data and its privacy

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
appropriately

106
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,840
and practically we have been doing that

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
it is

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
always important for us to keep the

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,720
user's trust for line while our users

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
can enjoy our services

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
and

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
if we could uh

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
keep such a condition we believe that

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
line could become a sustainable digital

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
platform that meet our social

116
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
responsibilities

117
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
tim cook of apple

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
has said

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
like

120
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
we shouldn't ask our customers to make a

121
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
trade-off between privacy and security

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
we need to offer them the best of wealth

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
this is just a challenge for

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
all the line

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
in today's presentation i'd like to talk

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
about

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
three

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
perspectives technology process culture

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
by these

130
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,759
three perspectives

131
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
we have been working on and challenging

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,719
for cyber security privacy

133
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
is by technology

134
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
this is a story of lion account security

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
line account security model is based on

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
mobile so

137
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,750
and not based on web so

138
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,039
[Music]

139
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
in general the potential risk of account

140
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
hijack is potentially

141
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
is a different

142
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
from the the case of web

143
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
because the mobile device service

144
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
account can exist

145
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
based on one phone number

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
and

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,039
let's say

148
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
the two mobile device cannot bind to one

149
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,440
phone number

150
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,479
it's true

151
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
and so

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,440
as soon as the normal user's account is

153
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,319
hijacked by the user abuser the normal

154
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,720
user's application let's say line

155
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
application becomes unavailable

156
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
this is a

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
different from web

158
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
and in early days of line application

159
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
the line account login certification was

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,639
very simple without any two-factor

161
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
authentication

162
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,319
so

163
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,639
it was very weak against password list

164
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,960
attack

165
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
um so potentially we had an account

166
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
takeover program

167
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,440
and

168
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
uh in real

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
after

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,840
2012 we found a huge number of victim

171
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
users of uh come takeover

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
especially in japan and taiwan

173
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,039
it was a

174
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,880
kind of big social problem remember

175
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
remember remember that

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,479
so in 2014 we have introduced four digit

177
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
pin code for blocking

178
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
password list attack

179
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,080
but as you know it's really old style

180
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,760
and it's not

181
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
uh

182
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
it's not a good countermeasure for

183
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
possible lease

184
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
you can easily imagine that many of

185
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
users tend to use the same four digits

186
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,480
from four digit number with the password

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
or email address

188
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
so that's why it was still weak against

189
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
password list attack and we found so

190
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
many abuses and

191
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,560
many victims

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
then

193
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,160
2016 we introduced a new migration rule

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,399
uh which is line

195
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
will check if the user has previous

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
device or previous phone number when

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,320
migrating to new device with new phone

198
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
number

199
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
in the settings

200
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
menu you can

201
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,519
check

202
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
the account migration switch

203
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
offline application this is one of them

204
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
and we found this approach was very

205
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,399
powerful to password list attack

206
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,279
and we found there was no password list

207
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,480
attack

208
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
available and succeeded after this new

209
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
is released

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,279
that was powerful other time

211
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,360
yeah but at that time

212
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
after that after several months

213
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
we found new type of abusers

214
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,480
uh

215
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
the approach was social engineering

216
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
abusers tries to talk to the normal user

217
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
after taking over his or her friend once

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,519
the abuser pretends to be

219
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
a friend and start the communication

220
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
hi help me

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,839
on what's up

222
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
uh i have lost my phone and

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
could you tell me your phone number

224
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
and yeah my phone number is blah blah

225
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
blah okay uh the pink order is sent to

226
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
your sms

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
please tell me the the pin

228
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,440
okay this is

229
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,399
7.158

230
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,680
that's all

231
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,360
um but doing this approach

232
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
abusers

233
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,760
succeeded to uh get account and

234
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
success

235
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,839
and we also found

236
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,200
then the the number of victims has

237
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
increased again unfortunately

238
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
speaking decision line it was was worse

239
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
situation

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
because we know that

241
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,399
changing our specification will never

242
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,920
improve this situation and the problem

243
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
so

244
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
we change it

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
the approach

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
the data analysis and machine learning

247
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
when the victims report to the situation

248
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
to line

249
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
we start analyze

250
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
the data and develop the model to

251
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
identify such abuses

252
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,200
by

253
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,519
using their business behaviors and

254
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
operations

255
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
and attributes as well

256
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,279
and in

257
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
september

258
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
2019

259
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
almost three years after new migration

260
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
rule is released

261
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
finally we have succeeded to examinate

262
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
lion contact over cases made it zero

263
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,560
since then

264
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
we don't have a massive accounting of

265
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
cases like before so

266
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
data analysis and machine learning was

267
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
finally very powerful

268
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,120
even for social engineering

269
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
this is a story of lion consecutive and

270
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,320
our challenge

271
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
next one is pyro

272
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
pyro is a new authentication standard

273
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,839
using public key cryptography and

274
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,120
specification

275
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,079
is standardized in file alliance and

276
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
major platform ios android windows are

277
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,920
supporting

278
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
for example uh the web wilson is really

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
well known standard

280
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,639
based on file specification

281
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
okay

282
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
this is story of line and vital

283
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,959
since

284
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,160
line joined in fighter alliance as a

285
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
board member

286
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
we have been releasing file enabled

287
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,560
services in line pay and line

288
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
and this year we have open sourced our

289
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,079
files to server software

290
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
and i will

291
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
explain

292
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,839
passwordless line in detail

293
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
from the next slide

294
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
this is the use case of passwordless

295
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
line

296
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
basically

297
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,480
password

298
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
uh will be never required to input in

299
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
login

300
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
with desktop line application

301
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
in this scenario

302
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,440
uh

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
only for the first time log in 6 digit

304
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
ping is required to input

305
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
yeah but

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
after that password input is not needed

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
in that device

308
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
this is a

309
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,160
high level system artichoke passwordless

310
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,079
line protocol

311
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
when the file protocol

312
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
is initiated

313
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
line application will

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,880
be woken up by push

315
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
and generate the key pairs of firewall

316
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
and make signatures

317
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,800
as a part of file protocol and so on

318
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,000
so

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
but we have several issues to implement

320
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
as in general

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,480
most of the developer will face the same

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
issue

323
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
first one how to

324
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,680
on

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
where to manage the

326
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,880
the public key periods for viral

327
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,600
the second one is how wide os versions

328
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
and platforms do we support

329
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,440
how do we realize a file policy flexibly

330
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
for example one of the application

331
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
allows only biometric but another

332
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
application allows biometric and ping

333
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,680
and

334
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,560
several kinds of authentication methods

335
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
that can flex

336
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
flexible policy

337
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
maybe we have to handle

338
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
so in order to resolve these issues

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,399
we have developed line trusted security

340
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,600
module ltsm

341
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
um this is the client-side architecture

342
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,639
or for a file or enabled application

343
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,360
based on ltsm

344
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
rp can uh

345
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
call the file client api

346
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
that is supported by ltsm core um ltcm

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
core will

348
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
provide the

349
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
um

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,279
some basic functions that in reality the

351
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,079
file features

352
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,279
and

353
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,920
it the adsm also supports the

354
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
abstraction for

355
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,199
uh

356
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,480
the authenticator user key management

357
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
and attestation key management

358
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,279
and especially

359
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
adsm can

360
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,360
support not only

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,560
android keystore including te

362
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
ios keychain but also whitebox

363
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
encryption

364
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,199
this is a safer protection software

365
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
module to protect

366
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
the cryptographic keys

367
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
in software level

368
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,079
in case that device doesn't support

369
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,040
android keystore or

370
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,839
in that case dsm can support that

371
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
so

372
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,040
thus the ldsm has been developed to

373
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
support as many types of platform and

374
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,639
services as much as possible

375
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,319
um

376
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
as you can understand in the previous

377
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,559
slide lion has developed the atsm which

378
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,599
is like

379
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
um

380
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
adopting the white box encryption

381
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
and supporting the wire coverage of both

382
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
ios and android version

383
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,199
and

384
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
abstraction of different

385
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,480
uh

386
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
of platform features like api in each of

387
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
these or each os or authenticator and

388
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
sequestration and so on

389
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,880
okay next one is letter seeding it's a

390
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
end-to-end encryption

391
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,880
uh

392
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
into an encryption is

393
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,400
the

394
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
by design

395
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,559
the server side let's say line server is

396
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,120
not able to decrypt the

397
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
encrypted message or obtain the

398
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,240
encryption key

399
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,480
it's different from tls

400
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
uh basic concept of letter sitting is

401
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,160
design

402
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
uh

403
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,039
like

404
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
any line application must support

405
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
latency

406
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,080
second one is any secret key must be

407
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
handled only in line application in the

408
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
client side

409
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
in third one a line server

410
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
is responsible only for limited

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
functions

412
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
gateway for key exchanges

413
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
message transmission

414
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
and

415
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,640
public key management

416
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,960
and so on

417
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
this slides to explain how the

418
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
encryption key is shared and how

419
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
the message is encrypted and decrypted

420
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
between one to one user

421
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
basically every line user has ecdh key

422
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
pairs

423
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
uh this is generated in line application

424
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
no not in the server side of course

425
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,039
and each stock room of line

426
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
share secret key is generated by using

427
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,960
the the room members

428
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
then the

429
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
plain message will be encrypted

430
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
using the shared secret

431
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,679
uh always using

432
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
sha256 and the asgcm

433
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
and

434
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
and c

435
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,280
and tag generated by

436
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
aes dcm will be

437
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
sent to

438
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
uh for sent from a to b and

439
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,240
the user we can decrypt it

440
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
uh

441
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,799
yes and uh

442
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,880
as we apply asgcm um

443
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
so receiver side can

444
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,679
obtain the play message wizard

445
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
uh

446
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
with the decryption key

447
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
and also the check the integrity

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,280
by using

449
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
uh this

450
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,080
this one date of authentication file

451
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,400
and here by assuming that

452
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,159
when this user is

453
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,360
using line application in iphone

454
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
but also

455
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
using the windows at the same

456
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
for the same line account

457
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
so

458
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
line application will be required to

459
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
synchronize

460
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
the ecd is key

461
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,840
key pairs including a secret key

462
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
and shared secret of the room

463
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,640
and also messages

464
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,520
the

465
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,000
question is

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,320
how we design

467
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,039
the

468
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,640
security for

469
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
such synchronizing the keys

470
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
the point is when they use the login

471
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
in the

472
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,520
line account in the new devices

473
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
how to synchronize

474
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,799
i will explain that

475
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
on the left side already

476
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,960
the account is

477
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,679
logging in this smartphone and the user

478
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,600
i would like to

479
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,720
log in in the new device with desktop

480
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
line application

481
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,080
starting from generating the ecd's kpi

482
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,480
for desktop line application

483
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
in the client side this is also in the

484
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
client side

485
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,080
and send the ecdh public key

486
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,280
that is encrypted with six digit pin

487
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,799
code this is the point and

488
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,280
the user can see

489
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
and input d6 this is pin code and then

490
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
the user side can

491
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,600
create the decryption key

492
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,799
and then

493
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,640
so then the smartphone site will get the

494
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,840
public key of this

495
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,520
of desktop application

496
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
so then

497
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,200
both sides can compute the shared secret

498
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
by using

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
uh this ecdh

500
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
cryptographic algorithm

501
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
so

502
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,159
this temporary

503
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,760
shared secret

504
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
can enable the two application to send

505
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
e2e message

506
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
i mean

507
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,400
by using this

508
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,880
e2e connection

509
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
the smartphone side will send the secret

510
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
key of ecdh

511
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
to desktop from smartphone to desktop

512
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
this is a solution

513
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,679
in in case of lines letter setting

514
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,720
so then

515
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
the two application can synchronize the

516
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
cryptographic key especially in case you

517
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
see this

518
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
public hand

519
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,240
private key

520
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
and

521
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
next one is ongoing challenging

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
first one is future of letter singing

523
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,880
the scope of the letter setting includes

524
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,440
text message locus location based

525
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
message and voice call video call

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
for limited features

527
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,559
but point is how

528
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
can we expand the scope

529
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
so in order to do that we need to

530
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
resolve the issues regarding for which

531
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
format like thumbnail generation

532
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,799
optimizing

533
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,960
uh the encoding

534
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,320
and resizing and resending and

535
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
transferring and storing

536
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
and so on

537
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,559
uh anyway as of today we are still

538
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,760
unchallenging for this issue

539
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
number two

540
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
is uh

541
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
assuming that situation like a user a

542
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
sends

543
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
a third message content to user b with

544
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,200
with end-to-end encryption but

545
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,039
uh

546
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,760
line would like to use study data even

547
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
though line doesn't need to know their

548
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,559
content itself for example the free

549
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
sticker

550
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
if

551
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,600
we apply the free sticker with e3 in

552
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
future

553
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,720
we can see that content

554
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,200
uh technically

555
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
but if line

556
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,799
could know

557
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,520
uh

558
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
what type of sticker free sticker is

559
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,919
popular for teenagers in christmas

560
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,440
season for example

561
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,320
this

562
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,919
kind of information will be a good

563
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,000
reference for creating new popular

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
sticker

565
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,039
in future so

566
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
it might be reasonable for the

567
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
reasonable that line

568
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
would like to know that

569
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
no

570
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
this kind of static statistic

571
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,159
information

572
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,159
but in order to realize that uh

573
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,080
there's several problems regarding the

574
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
privacy

575
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,279
uh so uh we look forward to

576
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,240
federation learning technology as a core

577
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,320
technology for solving the program

578
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
while keeping the user privacy with e to

579
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,440
e

580
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
and never send out the raw statistic

581
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,000
data to line server that line could know

582
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
a rough

583
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,039
but privacy protected statistic data

584
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,440
getting by getting

585
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,720
inputting

586
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,060
noise

587
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,360
[Music]

588
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
into the

589
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,480
into the the world data

590
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,120
this is also ongoing challenge though

591
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,760
we expect that challenge could

592
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,159
realize the best balance of privacy and

593
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,320
best business

594
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
in future

595
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,879
still on going challenge

596
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,080
next one is a by-process it is also

597
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
another important factor in

598
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,360
cybersecurity and privacy as you know

599
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,799
uh there is a famous quote by blue

600
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,080
schneier security is not a product but a

601
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
process

602
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
as we have many product release

603
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
in every month

604
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,559
sometimes in every week

605
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
our service production lifecycle is

606
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
always in operation

607
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,480
and we also have a security privacy

608
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
development life cycle

609
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,960
on that for

610
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
creating this better security and

611
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,919
privacy for the product

612
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
and i will pick up some process that we

613
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
are doing

614
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
first one is pia

615
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
pia is a private privacy impact

616
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
assessment process

617
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,760
it's uh in line it's a manage mandatory

618
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,559
process for any kind of services

619
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,400
that handles the personal data or

620
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
sensitive data our

621
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
privacy related information and so on

622
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,360
this process is to confirm the services

623
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,080
compliance with existing laws and

624
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
internal rules

625
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
and

626
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,720
also policies and in addition to that to

627
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
meet the expectation to privacy or

628
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
expectation from users

629
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,640
um

630
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,720
government media or other stakeholders

631
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
during the course of the process

632
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
pia team

633
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,080
uh consisting

634
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,279
uh

635
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,600
legal and data protection expert

636
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
sorry

637
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,600
check that what kind of data is

638
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
collected and why

639
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,559
and

640
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,960
who access and

641
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
how to control

642
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,080
and environmental control data

643
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
what the system or operational

644
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
environment

645
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
to control the data

646
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,600
um

647
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,799
anyway recently we have many services

648
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
that need to handle user data for

649
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,159
in mainly improving the user experience

650
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,559
of the service the number of pia

651
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,760
requests is increasing rapidly year by

652
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
year

653
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
we also have another management process

654
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,640
called risk assessment

655
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,039
this is a

656
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,200
kind of manual security test done by our

657
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
security engineers

658
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,240
basically any services are required to

659
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,799
pass the risk assessment process in qa

660
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,880
stage before releasing

661
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
but

662
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,600
we have so many risk assessment requests

663
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,279
recently

664
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,559
because the number of services are

665
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,679
increasing

666
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,880
so

667
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
our team is also challenging to develop

668
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,520
automated security testing environment

669
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,799
for supporting

670
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,080
the risk assessment process

671
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
this is called sims

672
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,600
security issue management system

673
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,720
the concept is based on deficient office

674
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,279
and for example triggered by the event

675
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,679
from git or jenkins security scanner

676
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
will start to scan the product

677
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
automatically

678
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
and notification of the report will be

679
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,799
also automatically sent to the

680
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,799
communication channel like slack

681
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,159
we have already developed and adapted

682
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,080
this system to

683
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,279
the some part of the real product

684
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,159
and

685
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,440
now we are going to expand the scope in

686
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,360
the next year

687
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
and i hope this system could optimize

688
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
the security engineers resources for

689
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
risk assessment process

690
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
next is our three processes after

691
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,799
releasing background program and

692
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,158
reporting and awareness

693
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,240
uh we are running running security

694
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,840
banquet program since

695
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,720
2016. now it is on

696
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
platform

697
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,039
we can have uh reports regarding

698
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,480
vulnerability or security problems of

699
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,840
our product from outside engineers in

700
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
global and the number of report is

701
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,919
increasing year-over-year

702
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,880
especially

703
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,679
2020 the number of report has

704
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
reached the maximum

705
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,399
these are figures related to the

706
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,880
background program um

707
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240
valid

708
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
valid report

709
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,960
is over 30 percent out of all reports

710
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
are found to be valid

711
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,039
just more than 100 reports in a year so

712
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,679
it's so helpful for us

713
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,559
amounting bounding in last year we paid

714
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,480
almost 1 000 usl

715
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,799
type of vulnerability there are

716
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,039
many significant type of vulnerability

717
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,960
you can find for example for example

718
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,399
information disclosure uh reflected xss

719
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,360
an improper access control ssrf that

720
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,799
covers almost 50 percentage

721
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
only by looking at this uh we can

722
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
understand how wealthy activity the bio

723
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,480
bounty program is

724
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,600
since 2017 we have an annual

725
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,760
campaign focusing on

726
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,320
account takeover and fishing and so on

as a awareness activity

728
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,159

729
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
in the internet life

730
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
in this recent

731
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,760
few years other internet companies also

732
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,039
join this campaign with line and

733
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,600
to live on up the campaign

734
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,720
now we have a common website and here uh

00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,880
provides interactive quizzes and

736
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,799
external links to the web website

737
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,480
of participating companies

738

to help the users and

747
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
employees also understand

748
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,919

and the better understanding and

751
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,919
awareness privacy in user user side is

752
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,600
one of the most important

753
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,559
issue

754
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,320
and it's also our challenge

755
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
this is uh

756
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,519
done in

757
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,960
in japan site

758
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,240
and this is in taiwan side

759
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
we also have a certain awareness

760
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
activities in taiwan

761
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,279
line timer has been running a large

762
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,760
campaign for users awareness

763
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
addressing the cyber security and

764
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,440
privacy risk and internet safety

765
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
for these several years lion has

766
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
partnered with irene

767
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,559
irwin is a taiwan same government

768
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,000
organization

769
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
dedicated to

770
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,919
promoting safety or internet environment

771
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
and this year's awareness campaign

772
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,159
address a program

773
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
related to teenagers and children's

774
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,039
safety

775
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,919
as

776
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,840
they

777
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,000
are uploading their private photos

778
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,440
usually

779
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,200
however which might be spread

780
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,760
involuntary

781
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,039
uh even the 40 percentage of them don't

782
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,960
know how to deal with it

783
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,519
this is a one of the big social problem

784
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,360
in taiwan

785
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,880
during this campaign we utilize this

786
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,600
online timeline line today live music

787
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,360
and an irene official account as well

788
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,039
and

789
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
this kind of

790
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,239
campaign is not only for awareness

791
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,399
for users but also contributing to

792
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,639
eliminate such a social

793
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,960
uh program

794
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,599
this is about reporting

795
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,480
this is also important activity from

796
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,280
uh

797
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,079
transparency point of view

798
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,199
every year line publishes um

799
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,679
transparency report

800
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,159
in this report we disclose a number of

801
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,320
cases we respond to

802
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,520
government

803
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,679
data requests based on

804
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,839
legal instruments such as such warrants

805
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,000
and we also show the

806
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
breakdown

807
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,639
by country and

808
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,919
quan type also

809
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,240
in addition to that we also disclosed a

810
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
content moderation report where

811
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
we show how

812
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,440
how many contents are taken down by

813
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,520
our monitoring activities in violation

814
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,880
of our time of use

815
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,359
uh example

816
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,040
the

817
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,160
promotion of illegal activities and uh

818
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,520
obscene content and spam and so on

819
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
for line side we could be aware of our

820
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,720
social responsibilities through

821
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,800
uh disclosing this type of report

822
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,680
and

823
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,480
for user side they could have an

824
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,720
opportunity to understand and judge the

825
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
soundness and social

826
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,520
significance of line's relationship with

827
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,480
government and also this activity itself

828
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
as well

829
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,119
we also publish this encryption

830
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,400
encryption report that includes uh

831
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
which cryptographic

832
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,359
algorithm we are using and what the

833
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,760
message what type of message the data

834
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
setting applies to

835
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,280
and

836
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,880
how much message are encrypted

837
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
as a statistic data

838
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
and so on

839
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,520
such information are updated and

840
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
disclosed

841
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,440
almost every year

842
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,759
the third factor is the culture

843
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
in most of our organization

844
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,040
uh i think

845
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,359
we have a big issue that how to educate

846
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,599
and improve skills of employees and

847
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,240
engineers for security and privacy not

848
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
only employee

849
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,640
like phishing and ipt

850
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,760
but also the for the engineers like

851
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,920
infrasecurity and server side engineers

852
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,359
and security engineers secure coding

853
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,720
configuration secure process

854
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,200
and so on

855
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,440
then we

856
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
have developed called line class

857
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
this is an internal education

858
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,839
environment

859
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,839
supporting the content management

860
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,400
education content management and

861
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
participant management

862
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
and score on achievement management and

863
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,400
so on

864
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
we value such a

865
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,560
skill development for security members

866
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,079
and we want it

867
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,599
we want it as

868
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
one of our culture

869
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
and also value to develop something we

870
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,119
are something by ourself when we need

871
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,240
something

872
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,440
this is also one of our culture

873
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,520
first motivation

874
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,280
of this line class was actually the only

875
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,079
fall

876
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,960
and focusing on our security members

877
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920

okay this is summary

962
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
okay in today's presentation

963
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,680
i have introduced lines key challenges

964
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,040
for these 10 years by technology by

965
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,160
process and by culture

966
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,960
that

967
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,599
included multiple directional approaches

968
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,160
and challenges

969
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,200
and of course to keep on such challenges

970
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,000
is

971
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,640
necessary for lying as one of important

972
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
social responsibility

973
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,800
and also we know we have to keep on

974
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,920
updating

975
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
finding better things for getting closer

976
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,079
to the best for cyber security and

977
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,000
privacy

978
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
we believe that such sustainable

979
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,079
challenge could be the source of our

980
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
users trust for

981
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,680
life that's all my presentation thank

982
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,000
you very much
