i introduce myself

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,479
my history i was playing a lot of games

13
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,040

hours per day or

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,479
something like that

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,159
and then during

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
the university days i was

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280

sort of the security models

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,878
so then after in 2002 i started work for

25
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,440
cyber security uh now

26

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
after that i started work for one

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,840
japanese mega bank called the ufg monk

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
for three years

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
then

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
in 2014 i worked for established

for japanese financial industry

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,599
then

36
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,560
i also start establishing our morris in

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,200
2019 that is a cyber security education

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
company so currently i mainly work for

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
financial side of japan and also i'm

40
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,200
adviser to financial services agency of

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
japanese government that is japanese

42
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
financial regulator

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
and i do several other things and

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,200
finally

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
my phobia is cycling

46
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,879
that

47
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
is my major part of my working time

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
so today's agenda is like

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
some small introduction some case

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
studies from japanese financial industry

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,599
cyber security

52
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
issues and then

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
several lessons around and conclusion

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
so introduction

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
so

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
uh when we talk about the japanese

57
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
natural industry cyber security i always

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
explain

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
there are three different roles so first

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
one is

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,920
there a regulator policy layer that is

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
mostly done by government or public

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
sector so second one is uh associations

64
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
take the guidelines and third-wise

65
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
operations

66
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
so first one is we have like financial

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,159
services agency as a regulator and the

68
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,959
bank of japan for the regulator

69
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
and central bank and they regulate

70
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
japanese banks and also we have the

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
nisc's

72
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,200
that is a national cyber security center

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
we have these three

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
public sector organizations as uh

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,799
making they make the regulations

76
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,080
policies

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
laws those things and for the guideline

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,040
part we have several many different

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,880
associations bank associations credit

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,960
card associations

81
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,919
insurance associations and also we have

82
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
the organization named fisk fisc that is

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,639
organization focusing on the creating

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
guidelines for computer systems

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
so buzzer this guideline

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
creating organizations

87
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
consider more like a

88
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
mid-term lens they don't

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
do the daily operations for cyber

90
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
security

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
uh issues so

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,639
the financial

93
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,960
financial like that japan is taking care

94
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
of more like everyday basis

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,960
uh incident like phishing or crowd money

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,840
transfers videos a lot so

97
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
if there's anything happens today we

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
discuss today and we do something today

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
so that's kind of the operational

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
viewpoint we financially like japan is

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,600
taking care of the important role of the

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
japanese financial cybersecurity

103
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
issues

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
so within in japan historically we have

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,199
a concept i think

106
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,880
many of you understand chinese

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,639
characters so i

108
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
uh

109
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
made it just right with chinese

110
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,800
characters so in japan we call it

111
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
that means

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,199
self-help and mutual help and public

113
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,400
health so that in japanese there is some

114
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
japanese history

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
that's if there's any problem in the

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
like a nationwide thing

117
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
so each

118
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
many of the people expect the government

119
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,919
the public entities will help everything

120
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,960
for the

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
everyone but actually the government or

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
public entities also don't have the

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
enough resource to do everything so

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
in the japanese history

125
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,360
sometimes government asks the please

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,560
consider to help by yourself first then

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,680
if you

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
don't have enough resource to do

129
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
everything by yourself please consider

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
to helping each other in the

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
neighborhood

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
so we call it jojo and that maybe in

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
english we can say mutual help so within

134
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
if we think about the japanese financial

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
industry we can

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,680
create some mutual help organization or

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
activities

138
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
to

139
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
to make our in japanese financial

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
industry cyber security better so

141
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
let's say that there's no single bank

142
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
one bank can do everything for the

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
industry so we need to think about

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
several different banks insurance

145
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
companies securities companies helping

146
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
each other to do

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
uh cyber security matters for

148
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
industry-wide

149
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,759
so with that that is a background of

150
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
what why we establish financial japan

151
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,759
and then

152
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
we work for

153
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
uh various cyber security matters and

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
helping each other to

155
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
like creating tools and doing the

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,759
project together

157
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,479
doing the exercise together or

158
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
create maybe training materials and

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
conduct hands-on

160
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,240
exercise something like that

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
so next i'd like to talk a little bit

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
about japanese cyber

163
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
landscape in financial industry

164
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
so we have many

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
various different cyber attacks happened

166
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,919
in

167
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
financial industry initially we say that

168
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,319
there are sophisticated

169
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
cyber attacks to cryptocurrency industry

170
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,639
that i don't talk much about this today

171
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,520
but

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
we see various cases that crypt currency

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,199
companies are facing with a very

174
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,960
sophisticated apt-like attack that is

175
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,759
very

176
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,240
highly technically highly motivated and

177
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
very difficult to detect or protect and

178
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,360
then

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
this is one of the important thing we

180
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,199
should consider

181
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
and then the next part next one needs a

182
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,240
fraud money transfer mainly target for

183
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
the bank or payment company in

184
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,958
securities companies insurance companies

185
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,599
so before maybe like 10 years ago five

186
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,600
years ago we see the front money

187
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
transfer goals only for bank

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
but

189
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
after we see the

190
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
more the more payment companies are

191
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
starting the services we see the

192
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
criminals targeting the payment

193
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
companies to do fraud money transfer and

194
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
in these two or three years we see more

195
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
securities companies or insurance

196
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
companies are becoming a target of the

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
fraud money transfer

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
so

199
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,279
i will explain some more details about

200
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
this one later

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
and also we see the various cases that

202
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
business or service suspension by ddos

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
attack or other

204
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
cloud service trouble or maybe other

205
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
hardware issues but

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
many people believe that

207
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
cyber security is only about cyber

208
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
attack but

209
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
we should think about

210
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
what is a business

211
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
we should think about business viewpoint

212
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,760
so if the business or service suspended

213
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,959
by some

214
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,160
reason

215
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
it is not a matter of the if it's cyber

216
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
attack or not so that we see various

217
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
cases that business or internet service

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
suspended because of the sometimes we

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,839
see ddos attacks sometimes we see

220
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
hardware trouble sometimes we see

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
misconfiguration sometimes we see some

222
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,700
the

223
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,040
[Music]

224
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
routing routing issues so there are many

225
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
different reasons to cause the business

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
or service suspension sometimes this is

227
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,959
a ransomware attack codes the business

228
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,519
suspension or service suspension

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,079
but from the business viewpoint

230
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,480
the reason like cyber attack or not is

231
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,519
not

232
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,200
super important but we see the many

233
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
i.t related cases that happen that

234
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
causes the business or service

235
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
suspension

236
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,760
also the there are as i think that this

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,079
is worldwide issues but the information

238
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
leakages through cloud services

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
in many most of the cases it is happened

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
because of the

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
misconfiguration the

242
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
maybe system administrator or system

243
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
integrator operators they somehow

244
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
misconfigure the cloud services and

245
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
somehow

246
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
publish the data and then someone finds

247
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
or your data is published and they

248
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
notified to you and then then you

249
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,839
realize your information is leaked so

250
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,680
those kind of the information leakage

251
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,040
through cloud services by

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
misconfiguration happens

253
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,880
uh

254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,000
a lot

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
like in japan and worldwide so that is

256
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
one of the

257
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,720
one of the issues we should focus

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,399
so the ransomware incident is uh now

259
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,360
becoming the problem worldwide

260
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,160
but i recognize

261
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
some some countries faces a lot of

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
around somewhere incident but

263
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
some other countries don't see there are

264
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
some incidents so it looks like the

265
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
land somewhere

266
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
threat actors are targeting

267
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
some

268
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
some companies that can pay the fee of

269
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
the ransom so

270
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,079
some i see the

271
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,040
i see that the criminal activities are

272
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,279
active in some countries but not active

273
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
in some other countries

274
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
and in japanese financial industry we

275
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
don't see a lot of the ransomware

276
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,000
incidents so far that is good for us

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,959
but we have several small several cases

278
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,600
that i can introduce i will introduce

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
some later

280
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
so now i need to introduce some case

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,839
studies

282
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,079
so talking about the fishings as you

283
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,320
know the attackers established a

284
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
phishing site for

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,760
bank or maybe

286
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,079
sometimes we see the payment companies

287
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,560
there is different fishing site

288
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
established everyday basis

289
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,440
and then most of the cases they try to

290
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
steal the information like id id and

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
password some personal information but

292
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
their

293
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,240
motivation is to

294
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
not only to steal the personal

295
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,200
information but they try to get money

296
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,160
by fishing attack

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,279
and the

298
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
bank

299
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,880
bank payment companies were main target

300
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
maybe like five years ago but we see

301
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
securities or insurance companies are

302
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,399
becoming more target these days so that

303
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
is one of the big difference

304
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
uh

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
for now

306
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,120
and i would like to introduce several

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
fishing site analysis in japanese

308
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,800
financial industry and we see

309
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
more than ten thousand cases sometimes

310
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
it's like seven thousand sometimes it's

311
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
like fifteen thousand so the numbers are

312
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,000
different uh but we see more than ten

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
thousand fishing site observed per month

314
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
and most of the fishing sites are mobile

315
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
companies large bank credit card

316
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,839
companies and those top three target is

317
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,839
like 80 percent of those 10

318
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,120
000. and uh

319
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
so fishing site phishing site usually

320
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,199
have their own domain names and then the

321
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,519
when we analyze the domain registration

322
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
companies

323
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,959
uh we see the dac dns public named cello

324
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
godaddy is mainly used

325
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
to register the domain name and the

326
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,880
important thing is those

327
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
registration companies are not major

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
majorly used in japan so

329
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,199
we we think that that is

330
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,839
there's another entities outside of

331
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
japan uh doing these activities

332
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
and also if we think about what hosting

333
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
companies are used

334
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
we see the eighty percent for only four

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
hosting companies i use eighty percent

336
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
of those facing sides so there are some

337
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,680
trends attackers are choosing some

338
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,279
specific hosting

339
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
companies uh to do to establish the

340
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
phishing site

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
and then we see the top-level domains uh

342
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,639
major major domains use top rapid

343
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
domains over org com cn top xyz and we

344
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,839
don't see a lot of the cases of the dot

345
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,959
jp domains used for our phishing site i

346
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,399
think that is because not jp is

347
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
kind of expensive compared to other

348
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
domain names and i think that they

349
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,920
choose

350
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
easier domain name or cheaper domain

351
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
name for a phishing site

352
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
and most of the interesting thing is

353
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
most of the phishing site is using https

354
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,399
and

355
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,040
actually there are some cases that for

356
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
example some japanese government website

357
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
is not using https but the phishing site

358
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,560
is using https

359
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
uh maybe it's like 15 years ago the

360
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
people said

361
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
facing site never use https

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,399
so we should

363
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
which can determine if the

364
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,399
their website or phishing site by

365
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
checking the https or not but

366
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,360
recently the fishing site is almost

367
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,320
all of them are using https by let's

368
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
enclypt and then there are some cases

369
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
that real sight is not using the https

370
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,279
uh so there is so now the physics side

371
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
are more secure

372
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
if we say so and then we see that they

373
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,399
they take effort to create the hdbs site

374
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,600
for

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
phishing site

376
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,120
and then also uh as i as i told you that

377
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
we see the

378
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
many

379
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
of the phishing sites were targeting the

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
mobile companies so there are three

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
major

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
japanese mobile companies are

383
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,959
ntt docomo a you kddi and then softbank

384
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,480
those three companies are major japanese

385
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
mobile operators and then

386
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,040
we see a lot of the phishing sites are

387
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
targeting those mobile operators that is

388
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,799
because uh

389
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,760
i think that mobile companies have the

390
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
crazy large number of the customer

391
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
volumes it's like uh

392
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,760
40 million users

393
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
potentially

394
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,039
run in japan or something like that so

395
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
maybe 40 million customers is like one

396
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,799
of the

397
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
largest japanese bank volume so

398
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,679
i think that it is

399
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,559
good cost performance

400
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,960
things to target the mobile companies

401
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
and then also the almost all of those

402
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
mobile companies have uh their own

403
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
payment services that

404
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
if the

405
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
attackers can steal some information

406
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
from users they can easily steal money

407
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
by those through those mobile payment

408
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,679
services

409
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
and also there we see the rights of the

410
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,740
using the isim ecm is easier to

411
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,039
[Music]

412
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,000
start service or create some contracts

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
then we don't need to go to the physical

414
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
shop to start services and maybe the ecm

415
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
or mobile payment services they do many

416
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,799
things online and then the

417
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
dockers can easily to steal money by

418
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
those online services and that is the

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,919
reason why

420
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,799
uh

421
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,039
i think the mobile companies become

422
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,400
target

423
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,679
so another

424
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
phishing site analysis and

425
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
we see the some cases that attackers

426
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,720
creates like thousands

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
of the url or single phishing site so

428
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
they use a dynamic dns services by duck

429
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
dns and create like hundreds of the url

430
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
and then they distribute the

431
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
uh urls for many people and then but if

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
we go to the phishing site all of those

433
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
different url facing sites are using the

434
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,400
same ip addresses ip address

435
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
and then

436
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,240
we see what we see is as you can see on

437
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,750
my screen

438
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,120
[Music]

439
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
so if when you receive some sms the

440
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
uh the link is like using bit.3 and why

441
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
and then if you click it that goes to

442
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,679
dynamic dns url and then dynamic dns url

443
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,240
go to the phishing site that all are

444
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
same ip addresses

445
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
so that is one of the case we see that

446
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
attackers are using a lot of the dynamic

447
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
dns

448
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
so that's another case

449
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
if you when you receive some phishing

450
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
email

451
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,679
and then you go to facing site they ask

452
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,200
id and password

453
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
and then they when you

454
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,400
type i and password you see the login

455
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,360
screen

456
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,000
actually you even if you type the wrong

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
id and password you can log in so that

458
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
is interesting part of the phishing site

459
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
so you don't have to input the right

460
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
information but if you are

461
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
expecting to see what's inside you can

462
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
just type some

463
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,520
strings looks like email address and

464
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,400
some

465
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,039
stupid password then you can go log in

466
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,679
and see they require to pay

467
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,559
some money so then in this case they

468
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
in this screenshot they require to pay

469
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,400
40 000 japanese yen

470
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
and then you can it looks like you can

471
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
choose some 711

472
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
pagey

473
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
and itunes it looks like you can choose

474
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
but actually you can choose only the

475
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
itunes

476
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
then you you choose itunes

477
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,919
uh

478
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,039
gift cards then go to the next page and

479
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,679
then they require

480
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
input

481
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,240
item serial code then the

482
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
you can you can finish the payment so in

483
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,039
japan we see many cases that

484
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,240
cyber criminals ask you to go to

485
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
convenience store and

486
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
buy itunes gift card and tell the serial

487
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,600
number

488
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
so that so it looks like the itunes gift

489
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
card is considered one of the important

490
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
thing for criminals and then

491
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,799
we

492
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
see the fishing site is also using that

493
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
kind of things

494
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
so

495
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
this is another phishing site if you go

496
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
to phishing site you type id and

497
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,080
password and log in after you log in you

498
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
require to pay some money and then

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,039
the phishing site will ask you to go to

500
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,520
atm physically and then

501
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,159
pay money by using the pages that is

502
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,600
japanese uh payment service that you can

503
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,080
do it at the atm and then the pc you you

504
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
you use pagey to do the payment that and

505
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
you need to go to atm on the fishing so

506
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
it's an interesting thing is a phishing

507
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
site ask you to go to physical atm

508
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,799
physically and to do the operation and

509
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
then they provide a very detailed manual

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,200
so this screenshot is uh

511
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
the manual how to operate the atm and

512
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
then the phishing site asks you to go to

513
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,159
atm and click this button

514
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
type one two three under

515
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,039
transfer like 20 000 japanese and

516
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
something like that so

517
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
so that's the teaching site is

518
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
not only the internet they ask you to go

519
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,679
to atm to make them payment

520
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,720
so also we see a

521
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,039
fishing site for life insurance

522
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,480
companies

523
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,679
and

524
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
that is kind of a new trend and but

525
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
within some

526
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
life insurance companies

527
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,039
as criminals can steal money once if

528
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,440
they get the personal information

529
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,280
and then uh

530
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,720
so because the many of the people

531
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
believes this kind of fishing site

532
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
happens only bank

533
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
in financial industry but so

534
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
when the fishing site happens in life

535
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
insurance companies life insurance

536
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,640
company people did not

537
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
have experience to handle fishing site

538
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
so that we discussed we create some

539
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
meeting to discuss about how we respond

540
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
to it and then bank people provide the

541
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,400
knowledge and experience to life

542
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
insurance companies

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
and also we see the

544
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,280
some

545
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
cyber criminals uh

546
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,000
contact customer support chat and ask

547
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
what to do so

548
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
what we see is uh

549
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
so customer support chat they say thank

550
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,280
you for waiting then there's

551
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,600
the customer and this is actually the

552
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,840
criminal is saying that i cannot access

553
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,480
to my service as a bank account

554
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,880
then the customer support said we detect

555
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,480
suspicious behavior

556
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,679
and then your account has suspended so

557
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,039
how i can

558
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,919
recover my account so then support says

559
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,200
we need identify identity information

560
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
like our name birth other's phone number

561
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,200
or etc

562
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,480
and then the

563
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
criminals actually have those basic

564
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
personal information

565
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,600
uh

566
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,919
through phishing sites so

567
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,039
they can

568
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,799
they can tell the exact right

569
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
information to

570
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
unlock the

571
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,640
unlock the account so then they steal

572
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,120
money and then they go somewhere so that

573
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
happens

574
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,240
so those are several cases i introduced

575
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,559
uh fishing site and

576
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:50,780
i

577
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,159
[Music]

578
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,240
i introduced some ransomware incident

579
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
happens in japanese

580
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,480
securities companies so in some

581
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,320
securities companies they have the

582
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,799
online trade service running through the

583
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,279
internet so

584
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,720
and then

585
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,679
for maintaining this system they had

586
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,799
some

587
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,440
computers uh using that that was wrongly

588
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,760
open the remote desktop protocol of the

589
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
windows rdp and then attackers somehow

590
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
find this rdp and get blogging get into

591
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
the online touring service and lose

592
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,640
around somewhere

593
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,760
incident

594
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,720
so this happens

595
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,440
because mainly because

596
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
this securities company initially they

597
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,559
did not

598
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,360
intend to use the internet to provide

599
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
service

600
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
um but they change their mind to use the

601
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,679
internet

602
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
and then they connect the system to the

603
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,120
internet and then

604
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
they change the network configuration

605
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,600
and then they wrongly open the rdp

606
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,240
without the proper access control and

607
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
then they didn't intend to

608
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
intend to

609
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,120
use rdp even use rdp but they

610
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,559
did their

611
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,600
operation misconfigure to

612
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,559
uh

613
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,840
open the rdp and attacker usage to the

614
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
ransomware

615
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,120
so in in this case the securities

616
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
companies could not recover all the

617
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,480
system they had data as backup but they

618
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
could not recover the system itself and

619
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,080
they

620
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,039
renewed system after this instant

621
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,640
but this incident happens uh

622
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
because they did not recognize rdp open

623
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,039
its misconfigure and also initially they

624
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,520
did not think about using the internet

625
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
for this service but they change after

626
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,559
years so that's kind of the

627
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,120
uh like the the difference of they

628
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
change the network diagram later and

629
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,960
also they miss wrongly uh turn on the

630
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
rdp so those kind of the

631
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
misconfiguration operation causes uh

632
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,159
somewhere incident so this kind of the

633
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
misconfiguration of things

634
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
always happens and uh sometimes we see

635
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
uh this kind of the things

636
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,679
causes a very serious cyber attack

637
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
incident

638
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,320
so

639
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,200
so that this is the third cases i'd like

640
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
to introduce to you under current

641
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,919
service access control there were cloud

642
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,919
service uh i say service s

643
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,720
and then this service company notified

644
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,200
the users there will be configuration

645
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
change happens maybe in three months or

646
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
something like that

647
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
and most of because this configuration

648
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,400
change uh looks very complicated many of

649
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,039
the customers did not understand what it

650
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,840
is

651
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,080
and then they tried to understand but

652
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
they couldn't understand that they

653
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
didn't take any action and then

654
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
this configuration change happens under

655
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,880
many of the international institutions

656
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,440
data suddenly become public because of

657
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
this change

658
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,600
so this is also happens

659
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
many of the people recognize this is

660
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
happens because of the misconfiguration

661
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
but

662
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
the

663
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,360
some of the users say

664
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,799
that

665
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
this announcement the notice of the

666
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
configuration change is uh

667
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,120
too complicated to understand and then

668
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
the two for understanding this

669
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
configuration change

670
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
these companies the customers need to

671
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
have the

672
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,760
very strong expert who and completely

673
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,720
understand this cloud service but most

674
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
many of the financial institutions

675
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,919
didn't have

676
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,880
that kind of the expert in the company

677
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
and then

678
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,000
they could not understand and this

679
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
happens so there are many discussions

680
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,880
what is a problem uh but i will

681
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,399
introduce later

682
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,120
but

683
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,279
this cloud service company says we

684
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,000
announced that so it is your fault and

685
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,399
then the customers i said no you

686
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
announced was not enough so it's like

687
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
there is

688
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,880
a

689
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
big argument between the ground service

690
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,520
vendor and customers

691
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,279
so this is the case

692
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,720
so what we do for it under so three

693
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,039
cases i introduced the fishing

694
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
somewhere on the ground service case and

695
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,399
for the fishing case we

696
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,919
because we see

697
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,000
too much number of the fishing site

698
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
launches

699
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,399
every

700
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,279
day basis and we create some small

701
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,960
technical group

702
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
to develop and distribute phishing site

703
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,919
detection too so

704
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,240
we use open

705
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
open source information all synth open

706
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
source intelligence capabilities to

707
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,760
gather the information of the phishing

708
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,640
site

709
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,880
uh urls and so you and the if isak japan

710
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,679
members can search if there is any of

711
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,240
the fishing site is available for the

712
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,279
company

713
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,320
for bank and then we distribute the two

714
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,120
to all the members and

715
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
we also provide the hands-on training

716
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
for in-house monitoring of the phishing

717
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
side

718
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,679
also we create a torah node servers list

719
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,840
for monitor suspicious ip addresses for

720
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,159
the banks and that is a kind of

721
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,279
effective way to monitor

722
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,200
some suspicious access to the internet

723
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
banking system or internet insurance

724
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,039
management system

725
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,559
uh from the suspicious ip addresses

726
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,880
and then the

727
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
so larger as as

728
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
maybe the large banks or larger

729
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
financial institutions have enough

730
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,559
resource to monitor the phishing set

731
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,279
everyday basis but the smaller banks

732
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,279
smaller institutions smaller insurance

733
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,520
companies don't have enough resource to

734
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,919
monitor the fishing side everyday basis

735
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,799
so

736
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,279
we do the create some information

737
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,279
sharing community phishing sites share

738
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,480
information

739
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,559
sharing community and

740
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,559
when we detect some

741
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,480
phishing site we

742
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,320
exchange the information among the

743
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,840
members and then the oh you about you oh

744
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,799
mr

745
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,120
x from bank a you have basic side today

746
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,919
did you aware that and we can tell that

747
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,679
and if the bank a person

748
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,720
uh

749
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,440
it is new for him to handle the fishing

750
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,559
site we

751
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200
the some of the community members teach

752
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
him how to handle the fishing side so

753
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,480
that is kind of the helping each other

754
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,120
things happens a lot

755
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,279
for phishing site activities

756
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,919
was a ransomware incident

757
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
in the beginning of my presentation i

758
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,760
introduced

759
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,559
we don't see many ransomware cases

760
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,600
other industries but we see around

761
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
somewhere cases some sometimes and

762
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
basically we don't see it is very

763
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,360
critically high seriously

764
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,840
uh impact thing but we keep gathering

765
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
the global trend of the ransomware

766
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,960
incident and what we discussed more

767
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,279
about ransomware is more business

768
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,279
viewpoint

769
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
agendas like uh

770
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
if we get

771
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,159
somewhere incident how we consider to

772
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,159
pay or not so

773
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,080
most of the people believe most of these

774
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,120
people said we never pay for it but

775
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
there are some cases especially in the

776
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,279
colonial pipeline case in the united

777
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,799
states they

778
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,120
pay initially pay and they take back

779
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,679
some money by fbi operation

780
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,640
so

781
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,840
there is option of paying if the

782
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,480
the victim company is very important

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,919
critical infrastructure companies so

784
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,559
so even even some global

785
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,279
discussions people want to leave the

786
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,600
possibility of the paying to run

787
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,880
somewhere to recover the data so

788
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,440
that's kind of the business uh decision

789
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
making discussion is running and also

790
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
the

791
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
another thing is if we get down

792
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,519
somewhere incident

793
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
in many cases we our business will be

794
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,320
suspended our service will be suspended

795
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,640
for three days maybe one week or even

796
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,440
one month or something so how we

797
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,480
do the bcp so we discuss those things

798
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
also

799
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,720
for the case of the cloud service access

800
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
control we after that happened we

801
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,760
discussed what has happened and we

802
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,000
discussed to create some guidelines how

803
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,840
to respond to it and

804
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,640
how to handle the cloud services access

805
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
control things so

806
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,720
every time when we see some cases

807
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,200
happens we get together and discuss how

808
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,080
to respond to it and what lesson what

809
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,880
are the lessons run and what we should

810
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,480
do for the next or future so we do that

811
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
and then also we discussed with the

812
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,719
cloud service provider and

813
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,440
what was problem it's like post modem

814
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,839
and then we see

815
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
uh

816
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
what we should have done for this case

817
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,199
so for the future possibilities

818
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,839
and also we organize some technical

819
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,560
member a technical seminar for members

820
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,199
what was happened what was the issue

821
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,800
who say what and what is a real problem

822
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
what we can do for the future so that

823
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
kind of seminars we organize and share

824
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,679
those information to all the members

825
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,239
so finally conclusion

826
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,520
so do some ppt people process technology

827
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,839
analysis

828
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
so

829
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
as i told you there are many different

830
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,159
cases of the cyber security cyber attack

831
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,640
situation happens in japanese financial

832
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,520
industry and then

833
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,640
uh the

834
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,400
the one of the important thing is the

835
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
security team really understands current

836
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
cyber threat situation in japan or not

837
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
or global so

838
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,960
so we need to keep update ourselves for

839
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,240
understanding the current situation but

840
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
if we work for some companies our

841
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,720
time goes to do some internal matters

842
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,040
but we need to see more outside of the

843
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,640
company to understand the current

844
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,599
situations so if focusing on the people

845
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
people don't have time to look outside

846
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
of the company

847
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,760
but they need to understand the current

848
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,079
situation so that is

849
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,839
sometimes making a problem

850
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,760
so and then also

851
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,040
we

852
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,200
then we organize seminar or hands-on

853
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,359
trainings opportunities for their

854
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,680
security people to learn and understand

855
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,760
the current situations

856
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,560
and then sometimes we see the people who

857
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,079
don't have the enough knowledge or

858
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,920
experience to understand the current

859
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
situation maybe

860
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
for understanding ransomware they need

861
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,599
to have some knowledge of the windows

862
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
operating system or software

863
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
or data backup or even some bcp

864
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,520
management other things or so

865
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,599
we if we recognize that people don't

866
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,599
have the enough knowledge experience we

867
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,839
create some training material

868
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,880
uh provide hands-on seminar provides

869
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
some lecture

870
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
or maybe table top exercise discussions

871
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,760
or things

872
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
and also the for

873
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,560
the people viewpoints

874
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,960
having the good information source is

875
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
important things and then

876
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,040
belong to community or strong community

877
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,359
the active strong community is important

878
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,200
to do that

879
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,240
and also the even if you have a very

880
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,320
good understanding of the cyber security

881
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
from the technical viewpoint management

882
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,640
viewpoint if you don't have the good

883
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
corporate internal communications to

884
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,280
others to rather than i.t division or

885
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,320
maybe board members or maybe head of id

886
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
directors uh

887
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
it is not

888
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
you are protecting the company so the

889
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,720
corporate internal communication

890
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,760
is another important part of thinking

891
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,920
and also that we should recognize that

892
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,960
people

893
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
we do misconfiguration and the

894
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
misconfiguration happens that causes the

895
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,960
cyber

896
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
incident and that cyber incident calls

897
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,720
the codes crs a business suspension for

898
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,359
the company from the process

899
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,200
organization viewpoint

900
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
creating the policy

901
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,160
is not difficult but the enforcement the

902
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,480
policy is much more difficult

903
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,680
and then

904
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,599
in many of the cyber

905
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
victim cases

906
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
things happen because we

907
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
really did not understand what ideas

908
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,800
that we have throughout companies within

909
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,200
including subsidiaries maybe overseas

910
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,440
something like that

911
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
and also the

912
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,160
we see many cases that how strong i.t

913
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,520
division security division matters how

914
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
they have the strong cyber security

915
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,400
issues

916
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,440
and also the recently the it is

917
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,720
worldwide problem that the top-level

918
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,440
uh corporate management understanding of

919
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,839
the cyber risk is a key issue for now

920
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,520
from the technically technology

921
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
viewpoint the small things cause big

922
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,640
problem like the ransomware ldp cases

923
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,480
that was a very small

924
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,200
misconfiguration but code that causes

925
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,160
corporate wide business suspension for

926
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,880
one month two months and then they

927
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
needed to rebuild all of the services so

928
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,280
there

929
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
if we

930
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
uh skip some small technical things that

931
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,839
causes a very big impact for the

932
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,240
business we need to understand that and

933
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
also recently the

934
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
we have the more discussions about if we

935
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,640
should do the in-house technical

936
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,119
operation or we should outsource

937
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,560
uh to the vendors and the more the more

938
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,400
financial institutions

939
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,480
start thinking about the in-house

940
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,240
technical operations

941
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,800
uh not perfectly depending on the

942
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,760
vendors so we see more cases

943
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,960
in-house

944
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,040
in house technical operation team is

945
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,880
running

946
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,960
and also the for the cyber security

947
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
matters it is daily operations agile

948
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,880
thinking is more important and also the

949
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,000
we

950
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,839
even in the financial japan we have 427

951
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,520
members we don't have

952
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,880
a

953
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
large number of the technical people the

954
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,760
who understand who can do the hands-only

955
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,400
programming who creates uh develop to

956
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,280
create tools or distribute tools

957
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,000
but if one of them

958
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,720
can develop the tool and distribute to

959
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,400
them they can help others so we should

960
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,320
understand the technical people can help

961
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,520
non-technical people

962
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
so then

963
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
it is always we say that we need more

964
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
people to work and then the

965
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
uh the if we think about the people

966
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,680
it is always i think about technical

967
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
skill or management skill so technical

968
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,079
skill is of course important to do the

969
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,079
technical operation of cyber security

970
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,640
models but we also need the management

971
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
people to discuss with corporate top

972
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,760
management or maybe

973
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
outside of the id division people or

974
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,359
maybe talk to regulators so both of the

975
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,119
technical and management skills are

976
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,960
important but there's no single person

977
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
who understand both

978
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,520
perfectly so we need to helping each

979
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,440
other to share the resource so then the

980
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,480
as i told you that talking to the top

981
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
level management is more getting more

982
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,599
important for making them understand how

983
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,079
the cyber incidents affect to their

984
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,800
business in the long term period and

985
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,680
then also the

986
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,160
even for talking to the top level

987
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,760
management

988
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,480
there are many challenges how to talk

989
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
what kind of words we should use

990
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,760
what is more important for them also

991
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
for having the even for having the

992
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
better discussion with top ratio

993
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,520
management so helping each other with in

994
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,359
the industry

995
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,079
to

996
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,920
like maybe company a tells oh i told

997
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,119
my

998
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,520
cio about this information and he

999
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,280
understand very well produce this

1000
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,079
material so that's kind of the helping

1001
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,160
each other in the industry is really

1002
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
effective

1003
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,720
for

1004
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,280
the better cyber security operation from

1005
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,200
even from the management viewpoint and

1006
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,599
technical viewpoint and then the that

1007
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,920
kind that can become a power

1008
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
to have the better cyber security

1009
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
so that is my conclusion thank you very

1010
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,760
much for your attention

1011
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,880
and

1012
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
i expect we have some time to get the

1013
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,920
question

1014
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,839
so for this uh very fruitful talk

1015
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,359
and um

1016
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,599
i see currently there's no question from

1017
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,280
slido yet and is there any question from

1018
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,000
anyone on site

1019
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,000
okay i i have a question so

1020
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,800
um you are the establisher of the f isac

1021
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,800
in japan so this is um you share meaning

1022
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
like a phishing site and this kind of

1023
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,640
information how do you

1024
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,440
share this information distribute the

1025
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,880
indicators like ioc to the banks and how

1026
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,839
do you

1027
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,359
encourage the

1028
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,240
the banks to share back the information

1029
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,598
to fi sec

1030
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,079
yes

1031
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,200
can you hear

1032
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,640
yes yes

1033
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,440
yeah

1034
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
so we share various information

1035
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
including ioc

1036
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,599
and also we sometimes share like a

1037
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,359
malware sample

1038
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,839
we share the ip address of the attackers

1039
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,560
for the front money transfer we share

1040
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,240
the various

1041
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,640
methodology methodologies of how

1042
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,800
attackers try to steal money from banks

1043
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
so we share

1044
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,720
very much of the technical details like

1045
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,760
malware sample ip addresses domain names

1046
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,560
hash value new things and also the how

1047
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,960
the attackers treat

1048
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,359
customers sometimes they make a phone

1049
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,760
call to the bank customers and try to

1050
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
cheat them and then we will share those

1051
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,680
kind of the social engineering technique

1052
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,760
information so we share the technical

1053
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,480
details also together with non-technical

1054
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
information

1055
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,280
and

1056
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
how do you encourage the members to

1057
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,560
share back the feedback of their their

1058
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,560
some ioc they suffer attack how do you

1059
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,800
encourage them to share

1060
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,680
yeah

1061
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,640
so

1062
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,520
it is always very difficult question how

1063
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
to encourage the members but if

1064
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,480
we if uh someone sometimes someone asked

1065
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,960
me a question if they have some

1066
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,520
information or if they face some

1067
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,000
situation like attack or some incident

1068
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,920
or some

1069
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,599
strange situation they ask us then we i

1070
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,839
suggested them to share the information

1071
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,560
to the community and then you will get a

1072
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,359
better feedback than my experience other

1073
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,720
my ex explanation so that

1074
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,319
if they if they once experienced the

1075
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,960
good uh good

1076
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,200
good thing by sharing the members they

1077
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,280
will keep doing that so

1078
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,400
uh

1079
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,640
anytime when some of the members have

1080
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
the situation we suggest them to share

1081
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,640
the information to the community and

1082
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,359
they will have the good experience by

1083
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,040
other members will

1084
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,480
actively

1085
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,880
help them to solve the issues or

1086
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,240
handling the incidents so

1087
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,240
many of the members hesitate to share

1088
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,760
the information to community but they

1089
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,960
want to talk to someone so we encourage

1090
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,520
each of them to share the information to

1091
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
the community not only talk to them some

1092
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,079
specific people then they will have the

1093
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,119
good experience and they will understand

1094
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,640
it is a better way to share the

1095
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,599
information to the community

1096
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
thank you thank you because

1097
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,839
i also work for one of the largest

1098
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,160
japanese bank and i feel sometimes i

1099
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
want to share some information but the

1100
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,560
maybe the upper management thing is too

1101
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,599
sensitive to share so that's uh

1102
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,400
uh we hesitate to show how much

1103
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,119
and uh instance and how sensitive

1104
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,440
instant should we share feedback to this

1105
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,560
kind of isaac that's always a challenge

1106
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,880
yeah

1107
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,680
yeah thank you thank you for this

1108
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,079
thank you

1109
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:08,960
and

1110
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,240
any other questions

1111
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
okay i have another a second question

1112
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,520
because i my maybe my role in the

1113
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,079
company very similar to your role like

1114
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,359
fighting these fishing sites like uh how

1115
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,480
how do you

1116
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,280
like we we have difficulty to uh take

1117
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,319
them down because um usually the hosting

1118
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,079
vendor or the

1119
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,560
cloud vendor they don't collaborate with

1120
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,960
us so it's difficult to take down

1121
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
fishing sites is there any uh better way

1122
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,839
to to like uh

1123
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,160
deal with the fishing sites how to block

1124
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,240
them like in taiwan

1125
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,119
taiwan police has a system to block

1126
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,720
fishing sites

1127
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,280
starting from last year so if

1128
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,359
there is a confirmed phishing site and

1129
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,400
we can

1130
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
report to taiwan police and time police

1131
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,359
can request the isp to

1132
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,480
stop resolving the dns

1133
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,880
so this is called the dns of prz the the

1134
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,560
pre resolution broker so

1135
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,119
police in taiwan can request

1136
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,920
taiwan sp to stop resolving some fishing

1137
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,200
domains is there any similar way to do

1138
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,119
that in japan

1139
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
oh yes in japan if we find some

1140
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,240
difficult situation to handle

1141
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,400
handle the incident only by financial

1142
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,119
industry we talk to the other industries

1143
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,079
like isps or hosting companies and

1144
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,319
sometimes we talk to the national

1145
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,880
uh sub team the jp coordination center

1146
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
or sometimes we talk to the government

1147
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,480
agencies for asking them to help contact

1148
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,359
the

1149
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,000
hosting companies or maybe the owner of

1150
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,480
the ip address or owner of the phishing

1151
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,040
site or something like that so we always

1152
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,760
try to expand our network to talk

1153
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,000
handling the incident both of the

1154
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,560
locally in japan and also globally

1155
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,359
international so sometimes if we need to

1156
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,839
contact to some international financial

1157
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,599
institutions we talk to the

1158
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,480
international friends to find the point

1159
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,760
of contact

1160
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,720
to help us or sometimes we set up like a

1161
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,119
meeting or conference to talk to them

1162
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
for asking them to help to solve the

1163
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,200
issues so

1164
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
if there's anything we cannot solve by

1165
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
ourselves we always

1166
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,000
ask to help like even if it's police

1167
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,359
agencies or japanese government agencies

1168
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,119
or maybe cyber security companies

1169
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,400
vendors or anything like that

1170
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,920
thank you very much yes i think um

1171
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,640
the

1172
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,960
taiwan and japan will suffer many

1173
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
similar criminal case

1174
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,119
because maybe the same criminal actor

1175
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,000
want to

1176
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,680
attack a bank in taiwan and japan both

1177
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,119
like um

1178
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,920
the same actors behind so we can

1179
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,200
collaborate

1180
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
more in the future so thank you very
