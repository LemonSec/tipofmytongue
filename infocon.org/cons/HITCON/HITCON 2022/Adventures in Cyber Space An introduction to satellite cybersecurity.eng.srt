2
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
i work with the dod's directorate for

3
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
digital services

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
but today i'm actually speaking in my

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
personal capacity mostly about research

6
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
i did while i was a phd student at

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
oxford

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
where i studied space cyber security

9
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
and what i want to do today is pull

10
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
together some threads from my research

11
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
into space cyber to try to motivate

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,399
people in the audience who might be

13
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
curious about this field to get started

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
and to get an understanding of why space

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
security matters and what they might be

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
able to do to help

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
with regards to the first point i think

18
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,840
it's pretty obvious to most people that

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
space matters and we've known that space

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
is something special since the very

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
early days of the space race this quote

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
from then u.s senator lyndon b johnson

23
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,319
in the 1950s really embodies this

24
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,959
mindset of space as a sort of ultimate

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,280
high ground and this idea that

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
controlling space gives someone

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
influence or control of the world below

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,920
orbit as well

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
and this has been embodied by many

30
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
modern militaries which rely on gps and

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
communications from orbit

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
in order to execute their missions and

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
also many modern businesses which rely

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
on satellite data or connectivity

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
in order to be able to maintain their

36
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,280
kind of globalized posture

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,200
and given the importance of space it

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
kind of raises uh interesting puzzle

39
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
because

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
there aren't any space wars right

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
so to date there have been basically

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
no

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
destructive attacks against other

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,480
people's satellites in orbit and given

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
how important satellites are and how

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
many countries and individuals and

47
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
businesses rely on them

48
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,239
this is a bit of a puzzle why is space

49
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,599
so peaceful

50
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,879
and will it stay that way

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
in this brief we're gonna delve into

52
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
that peace puzzle and try to figure out

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
what it is that's kept space peaceful

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
and how cyber counter space capabilities

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,640
might interact with that how cyber

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
attacks on satellites might interact

57
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,760
with the balance of peace in orbit

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
we'll also take that kind of theoretical

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
policy thinking and apply it practically

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
to two case studies

61
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
the first will look at an attack against

62
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
something called space situational

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
awareness data where we'll pretend we're

64
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
a nation-state actor with kind of

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
sophisticated capabilities to compromise

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,680
a key database that stores information

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
about what's in orbit and we'll see how

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,160
that attack can mess with other people

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
in space and how they operate

70
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
we'll also consider a simpler case study

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
something that can be done by an

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
individual with about three hundred

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
dollars in home television equipment and

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
how that equipment can be used to

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
intercept deeply sensitive

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
communications uh that are probably

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
better kept private but that are

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,919
available to anyone with knowledge to

79
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
intercept them from modern satellite

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
internet feeds

81
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
so let's dive into it and start

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
unpacking this piece puzzle

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
so we'll talk about something called

84
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
asap or anti-satellite weapons and try

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,440
to determine if space will remain

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
peaceful even in the context of cyber

87
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
asap capabilities and for me i think

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
there are three broad reasons that space

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,320
has remained peaceful despite there

90
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
being strong incentives to attack other

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
people's space assets

92
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
the first of those reasons is

93
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,560
accessibility

94
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
it is quite hard to actually get to

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,320
space this image here is from india's

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
anti-satellite weapons test that

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,000
occurred a little while back

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,639
and represents india becoming the fourth

99
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,520
country in history to demonstrate an

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
anti-satellite weapons capability using

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
kind of kinetic vectors like rockets

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
in general it's not just the

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
anti-satellite weapons that can be uh

104
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
difficult to develop they're only about

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
a dozen or so depending on how you count

106
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
countries that can get things into space

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
without someone else's help doing so so

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,240
countries that have their own orbital

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
launch capability

110
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
by comparison it's much easier for

111
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
countries to play in the cyber game

112
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
everyone has computers everyone has

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,919
access to the internet and they can have

114
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
that kind of influence over

115
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
cyberspace in order to even start

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
developing weapons

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,319
likewise when we think about

118
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
anti-satellite weapons there's only

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
a very small number of countries that

120
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
have demonstrated anti-satellite

121
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
capabilities china the united states

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
russia and india

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
while on the flip side

124
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
there's a huge number of countries that

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
have demonstrated offensive cyber

126
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,759
capabilities in some way or another

127
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
and just in general most countries are

128
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
way closer to being able to build a

129
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
cyber weapon than they are to being able

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
to develop a space program

131
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
the main reason for that of course is

132
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
cost

133
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
the cost to develop a space program and

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
then get that space program to a point

135
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
where it can develop weapons is to the

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,199
tune of billions and billions of dollars

137
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
meanwhile the cost to develop a cyber

138
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
capability it may be expensive you may

139
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
have to hire some engineers but it's

140
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
being on the scale of hundreds of

141
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
thousands or maybe the low millions of

142
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
dollars nothing like a space program and

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
its complexity to get even the best of

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,160
the best vulnerabilities for your kind

145
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
of cyber anti-satellite weapons

146
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
likewise if we think about kind of a

147
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,280
softer policy environment as a factor

148
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,800
that's keeping space

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,360
safe there are all kinds of reasons that

150
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
a kinetic anti-satellite weapon might

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
violate international norms this image

152
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,680
here is a map of countries that sign

153
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
something called the outer space treaty

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
which bans the weaponization of outer

155
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,160
space

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,919
and while the outer space treaty has all

157
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,479
kinds of problems i think it is the

158
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,039
start of a legal regime that at least

159
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
raises the diplomatic cost of attacking

160
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,520
someone else's satellite with a

161
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
traditional anti-satellite weapon

162
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
there is this outer space treaty regime

163
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
that's been around for 50 years and

164
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,879
adopted by hundreds of countries

165
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
against the use of kinetic

166
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
anti-satellite weapons well on the cyber

167
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
side there's nothing comparable we've

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
got the talon manual which is kind of

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
policy guidance for the kind of laws of

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
combat as they relate to

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
cyber conflicts but it's very weak and

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,039
indecisive in terms of who's going to

173
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
listen to it and to what extent

174
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,399
likewise states tend to be cautious

175
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
historically when pushing the boundaries

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,958
in space even when they break the rules

177
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,519
they often justify their rule breaking

178
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,679
by pointing to precedent and saying

179
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,800
actually it's an interpretation question

180
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
in cyberspace many states have shown

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
that they are quite happy to break the

182
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
rules whatever those may be

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
in terms of pushing the boundaries for

184
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
acceptable behavior in kind of cyber

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
attacks

186
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
likewise with kinetic weapons it's very

187
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
easy to know who's responsible you can

188
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,480
see where the rocket that hit your

189
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,839
satellite launched from and know who to

190
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,640
blame cyber weapons are very hard to

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
attribute by comparison it can often be

192
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,480
a

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
false flag kind of thing where you've

194
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
got you know strings in your malware to

195
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
lead someone to suspect someone else of

196
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
developing it

197
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,839
it can be very difficult to

198
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
actually pin down whether it was a state

199
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
actor or a state-sponsored actor or a

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
patriotic non-state actor who's

201
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
responsible for an attack and this lack

202
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
of attribution can make it much easier

203
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,839
for states to expect to get away with

204
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,080
cyber attacks on satellites in a way

205
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
that they haven't historically been able

206
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
to get away with kinetic attacks on

207
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,480
satellites

208
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
finally there's the environment as a

209
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
factor this image here is of pieces of

210
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
space debris orbiting the earth there

211
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,720
are thousands of tiny objects like these

212
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
that if they crash into a satellite they

213
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
can destroy it random bits of metal and

214
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,000
stuff that fell off of other space

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
missions

216
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
and every time an anti-satellite weapon

217
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
is used it can create more debris

218
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,880
because it hits a satellite it breaks

219
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,800
that satellite up into pieces and those

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
pieces go on to threaten other

221
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
satellites

222
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
this high risk of collateral damage from

223
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
generated debris

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
really deters the use of kinetic

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
anti-satellite weapons you don't want to

226
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
shoot any satellites because you may

227
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
damage the overall space environment

228
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
on the cyber side there are all kinds of

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,399
ways that someone might debilitate or

230
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,040
disable a satellite with kind of zero

231
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
debris counter space capabilities

232
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
something like just denial of servicing

233
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,160
a satellite that doesn't destroy it but

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
disrupts its ability to provide value to

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
an opponent

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
likewise when debris goes into space it

237
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,040
stays there for a long time and so the

238
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
cost of generating debris can be very

239
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
high you may constrain your access to

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,720
orbit for decades or even centuries as

241
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
pieces of debris remain out in space

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
threatening satellites

243
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
on the flip side when we talk about a

244
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
cyber asap weapon

245
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
the effects of a given exploit are often

246
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,240
much more controllable by an attacker

247
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
and while you can imagine cyber exploits

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
that destroy satellites you can also

249
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
imagine exploits that do a little bit

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
less we're going to look at an exploit

251
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
that just shortens the life span of a

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
satellite by wasting fuel for example in

253
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
a way that's very hard to attribute and

254
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,680
detect

255
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
and achieves some benefits for an

256
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
attacker with very low environmental

257
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
risk

258
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
finally when we think about who cares

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
about the space environment basically

260
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,079
everyone who has an anti-satellite

261
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,959
weapons program also has a space program

262
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
and satellites and so they are

263
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,360
particularly interested in keeping the

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
space environment safe so that that

265
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,760
investment in rocket launch technologies

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
and access to orbit isn't wasted

267
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
when we flip the coin around and look at

268
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
cyber weapons though things are a bit

269
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
different

270
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
many of the people who can attack

271
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
satellites in cyberspace don't have

272
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,079
space programs they could be nation

273
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
states or even individuals who don't

274
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
care quite as much about the space

275
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,519
environment and so that deterrent effect

276
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
that has historically kept space safe

277
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
for environmental reasons may also

278
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,639
weaken as satellites become more

279
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,240
vulnerable in the cyber domain

280
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
so to summarize we've kind of presented

281
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
an argument here that cyber

282
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
anti-satellite weapons so hacking

283
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
satellites to damage or disable them

284
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,279
is a threat because it uses relatively

285
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
accessible technology compared to

286
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
traditional anti-satellite weapons

287
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
it's difficult for countries to deter or

288
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
attribute

289
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
and it doesn't have the same

290
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
environmental effects as kinetic

291
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
anti-satellite weapons

292
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
so this all suggests that we should

293
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
expect to see increasing interest

294
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
in digital counter space to the extent

295
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
that countries want to attack satellites

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,480
using cyber attacks to do so seems like

297
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
one of the

298
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
easier and more compelling ways to go

299
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,600
about it

300
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
but how do we put this theory into

301
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
practice what can we actually do

302
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
uh in terms of what an attacker can get

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,560
away with and what would a cyber attack

304
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
on a satellite actually look like

305
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
i'm going to run through two case

306
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,399
studies today the first is going to look

307
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
at something called space situational

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
awareness data which is information that

309
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
tells us about what's in orbit and we'll

310
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
see how someone who messes with this

311
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,800
information

312
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
might be able to harm the safety and

313
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
security of other people's space

314
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,079
missions

315
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
so ssa or space situational awareness

316
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
data describes everything that's

317
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,639
orbiting the earth whether it's a piece

318
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,360
of debris or an asteroid or a comet or

319
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
other satellites and it's used when

320
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
you're planning your space missions and

321
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
picking orbits or to project whether or

322
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
not your satellite is at risk of being

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
crashed into by a piece of space debris

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
it's really really important for

325
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
countries to have a good idea of what's

326
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
going on in space both to protect their

327
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,320
satellites and also to understand what

328
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
other countries are up to with their own

329
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
satellites to identify spy satellites

330
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
for example

331
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
however it's also really hard to do

332
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,880
space objects move very very quickly and

333
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
they can be difficult to detect without

334
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
tons and tons of radar systems and

335
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
sensors and scanning satellites and

336
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,920
telescopes

337
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,639
in fact it is so expensive

338
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,519
that there are very very few countries

339
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
that have a robust catalog of what's in

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
orbit

341
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
the dominant catalog is run by the us

342
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
government as part of their space

343
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
surveillance network and it's believed

344
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
to be the only catalog with really good

345
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
coverage for objects measuring 10

346
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,320
centimeters in diameter so like the size

347
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
of a rubik's cube or even smaller than

348
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
that in low earth and geostationary

349
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
orbits

350
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
to do this the us military has

351
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,440
telescopes and radar systems distributed

352
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
across the globe which are constantly

353
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
scanning the skies to track these pieces

354
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
of debris they even have some satellites

355
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
in orbit which are doing scanning

356
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,600
the next closest network is probably

357
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
russia's

358
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
which operates a space surveillance

359
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
system primarily using telescopes in

360
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
former soviet territories

361
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,839
these telescopes provide russia really

362
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,600
good coverage of certain low earth

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,560
orbits

364
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,680
but even russia likely has to refer to

365
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,320
the u.s information published out of the

366
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
space surveillance network to really

367
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
know what's going on in orbit for some

368
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
smaller objects

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
finally it's worth mentioning that china

370
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,959
is a growing player in this space and

371
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,560
one of the big things that china has

372
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
been developing around is this idea of

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,959
mobile space surveillance systems on

374
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
ships because china doesn't have a lot

375
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
of overseas military bases that they can

376
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
use to distribute telescopes around the

377
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,560
world

378
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
but you need telescopes in multiple

379
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
points in order to do the calculations

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
to figure out where an object is moving

381
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
and kind of identify objects

382
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,480
so what they've done is they've built

383
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
these very expensive ships which carry

384
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
telescopes across the oceans in

385
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
international waters so they can do the

386
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
scanning that way

387
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
and this is kind of a work around on one

388
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
hand but it shows also how incredibly

389
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
expensive and difficult it can be to get

390
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
access to this data

391
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
for most other countries

392
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,399
they may have some limited domestic

393
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
capabilities the eu has a little bit

394
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
japan has a little bit

395
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
but they fundamentally will have to rely

396
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
on third party data

397
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
that third-party data could come from

398
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
the private sector although most private

399
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
sector companies don't have

400
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
really robust catalogs yet they're

401
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
trying to make them

402
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,199
but in practice it almost always comes

403
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
from the us military who freely shares

404
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
their information

405
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,480
through a website called spacetrack.org

406
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
out of the space surveillance network

407
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,599
and the us military does this because it

408
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,119
allows them to keep the space

409
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,280
environment safe it prevents collisions

410
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
from happening where a piece of debris

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,160
hits a satellite and damages it and it

412
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,679
causes a cascade where there's more

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
debris that threatens more satellites so

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
it's better for everyone if the space

415
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
environment stays safe and as part of

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
that sharing ssa data can encourage that

417
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
collaboration and that safety

418
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
now the data in these catalogs is

419
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,679
frequently shared in a format called a

420
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,559
two-line element set or a tle

421
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,320
which is a format that was designed to

422
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
be printed on two 80-column punch cards

423
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
and with this very basic information

424
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
it's actually possible to understand uh

425
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,760
the orbit of a satellite to understand

426
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,160
the key properties of how a satellite is

427
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
moving and where it is going over like

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,160
the next 72 hours or so

429
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
this is the main format shared by space

430
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
track

431
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,320
and while you can get better data this

432
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,919
is the format of data that you can get

433
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
without signing any special agreements

434
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,720
or promises with the us government so we

435
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
think about international parties that

436
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,559
may be relying on this data set but

437
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
don't necessarily trust the us

438
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
government uh two lane limit sets are

439
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
kind of a starting point for that data

440
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
so why would someone target this sort of

441
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,679
data to attack a satellite

442
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,360
well the data is highly centralized

443
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
right there's only a handful of

444
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
databases in the world with this

445
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
information so if you can compromise

446
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,840
even one of these catalogs you can have

447
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
a huge impact on what people think space

448
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
is like you can deceive quite a lot of

449
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,160
people with relatively little access

450
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
additionally

451
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,559
most users don't have any way to verify

452
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
this information independently they

453
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
can't just pop out a telescope on their

454
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
back porch and look to see if there's a

455
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
satellite where they're supposed to be a

456
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
satellite it's actually really

457
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,360
complicated to detect a lot of these

458
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
smaller objects and so they sort of just

459
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
have to take the databases word for it

460
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
so if an attacker compromises the

461
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
database they may evade detection for

462
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
quite some time

463
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,280
additionally even though the data itself

464
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
is just bytes on a computer somewhere it

465
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
has really important effects for how

466
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
satellites operate and how they fly

467
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
so who would be wanting to take

468
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,240
advantage of these effects

469
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
i think there are a couple of possible

470
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
threat actors who would target ssa

471
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
one are the repository owners so the us

472
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,919
military the chinese military the

473
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,360
russian military

474
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
might take advantage of the fact that

475
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
they control both the telescopes and the

476
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,919
database in order to lie about it to

477
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,919
create false information that they share

478
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
with third parties

479
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
and cause those third parties to engage

480
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,039
in

481
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,000
unsafe or irrational behavior in terms

482
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
of how they fly their satellites because

483
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
they've been deceived

484
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,720
likewise we might think about

485
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
sophisticated attackers who compromise

486
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
these databases and take advantage of

487
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,240
the fact that they could compromise

488
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
maybe the sensors that feed into them or

489
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,160
the databases themselves to start

490
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,760
deceiving people who rely on that

491
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
information

492
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,120
finally even an individual or organized

493
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
crime group

494
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
may find that they're able to gain

495
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
access to these sorts of records right

496
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
they're just databases on a computer

497
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,799
somewhere

498
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
and could take advantage of these

499
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
centralized repositories

500
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,640
to have an outsized effect on the space

501
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
environment

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
so let's imagine kind of two types of

503
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,559
goals

504
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,720
the first goal is where an attacker

505
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
tries to conceal an impending collision

506
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
by messing with the database

507
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
and this is really intuitive right the

508
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
attacker finds a collision in the

509
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
database they change the two-line

510
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
element set for the piece of space

511
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,799
debris a little bit

512
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
and then a satellite operator thinks

513
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
their satellite is safe up until the

514
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
moment it collides with something that

515
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,600
wasn't forecast to be where it is

516
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,039
however today we're going to focus on

517
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
kind of the opposite version of this

518
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,840
attack which is a little bit more slow

519
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
burn

520
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
and less likely to create environmental

521
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,080
consequences so we're going to imagine a

522
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
scenario

523
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,400
where an attacker looks at the data set

524
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,159
and basically says you know this piece

525
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,320
of debris isn't going to crash into my

526
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,240
adversary's satellite

527
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
but i can make it look like it is and

528
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
the effect of that is that they're all

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
going to have to get up at you know

530
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
three in the morning and rush to the

531
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,240
office

532
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
to deal with a collision notification a

533
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,520
conjunction alert and they're gonna have

534
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,640
to spend their time and their fuel to

535
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
avoid this piece of space debris that

536
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,960
actually isn't there at all this ghost

537
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
collision and over time this will

538
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
increase the cost of their space

539
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,159
missions shorten the lifetime of their

540
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,280
satellites

541
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
and allow me to take advantage of my

542
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
control of this data to impair my

543
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
adversary's ability to operate in space

544
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
so there are a couple of things we're

545
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,360
going to assume as we're modeling this

546
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
attack

547
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,919
the first is that the attacker has

548
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,200
figured out how to compromise this

549
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
database whether that's like a zero day

550
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
in the operating system or espionage a

551
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
human intelligence officer who can

552
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,000
tamper with the files or the sensors it

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,559
doesn't really matter all that much

554
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,400
for modeling purposes we're going to use

555
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,080
two line element sets for our

556
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
conjunction analysis so to determine

557
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
whether or not an object collides with

558
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
another in practice people tend to use

559
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
more granular and precise data formats

560
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
than two line element sets

561
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
but fundamentally it doesn't really

562
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
matter what data you're using to tell

563
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
the lie

564
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
the lie itself would be the same in any

565
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
format

566
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
we'll also say that the attacker doesn't

567
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
double check an impending collision the

568
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
collision is either happening too soon

569
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
or the sensors don't have the capacity

570
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,520
to vet the conjunction alert with like

571
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
further sensing so if the forecast of an

572
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
orbital propagation model is that a

573
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
collision will happen the attacker will

574
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,919
react to that collision as if it will

575
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,960
happen

576
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
depending on the real world practice

577
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,480
this is somewhat realistic for certain

578
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
operators and very unrealistic for

579
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
others but at least helps get the idea

580
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
across

581
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
finally we're going to say that any pass

582
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,600
within one kilometer of the target

583
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,559
satellite

584
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,960
counts as a collision that's the

585
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,799
precision of a two-line element set in

586
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
the model that we're using

587
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,039
and so it's roughly how close you would

588
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
expect the two objects to be before you

589
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
start needing to change your behavior to

590
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,280
avoid that collision

591
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,080
now

592
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,240
in order to tamper a two-line element

593
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
set to create a collision we need to do

594
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,280
a couple of things

595
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,039
we need to pick the correct debris

596
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,760
object to make into our ghost collider

597
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,360
we need to put that object into a

598
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,039
specific orbit

599
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,799
we need that orbit to result in the

600
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
object being in a specific location the

601
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,039
location where our target satellite is

602
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
and we need it to be in that location at

603
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
a specific time the time when our target

604
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,720
satellite is also there so the two

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
objects collide in orbit

606
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
this is quite tricky especially because

607
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
we're trying to avoid detection we're

608
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,120
not just going to delete and enter in

609
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
the database and create a completely

610
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
fake object what we want to do is make

611
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
very small modifications to a real

612
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,039
object to make it look like it'll

613
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,960
collide

614
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,400
so let's walk through that process of

615
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,640
making those modifications

616
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
the first thing we're going to do is

617
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
look for objects that could threaten our

618
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,159
target satellite so here is our victim

619
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,000
satellite that we're going to try to

620
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
create a ghost collision for

621
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
we'll model that satellite's orbit as a

622
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
kind of plane that cuts through the

623
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,400
earth

624
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
and we'll look for debris objects that

625
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
touch that plane at some point in the

626
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,120
next 72 hours

627
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
for the objects which crash into that

628
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,039
plane

629
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
we're going to see which objects while

630
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
they're touching that plane

631
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,080
are kind of inside this sphere here so

632
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,440
this area

633
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,799
around our target satellite

634
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
and so those objects that kind of pass

635
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
within a kilometer or so actually this

636
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
is about a thousand kilometers the

637
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
sphere that you see here of our target

638
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
satellite will be candidates that will

639
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,799
try to modify the intuition here is that

640
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,960
something that like almost crashes into

641
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,679
our target satellite is probably easier

642
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,760
to make look like it's going to crash uh

643
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
with modifications than something that's

644
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
nowhere near our target

645
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,240
so let's go ahead and run our simulation

646
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,679
for 72 hours and what you'll see is as

647
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,360
certain pieces of debris pass through

648
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,799
this kind of zone

649
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
of collision potential around our target

650
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,919
satellite

651
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,240
they will light up and will kind of log

652
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
how close they come at their time of

653
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,279
closest approach to our victim

654
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,080
once we've modeled our 72 hours and kind

655
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
of compiled our data set of potential

656
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
targets what we'll be left with is this

657
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
list here of five

658
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,760
objects that pass closest to our

659
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,640
satellite within the next 72 hours

660
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
now modifying these objects is actually

661
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
a

662
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,159
really difficult problem it's hard to

663
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,880
know how a change in like one component

664
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,039
of a two-line element set will result in

665
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
a change in a position of an object over

666
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
72 hours

667
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,480
but what we can do is use a basic

668
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
genetic algorithm so a sort of machine

669
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,640
learning approach to sort of guess and

670
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
check and the way we'll do that is we'll

671
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
define our individual

672
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,360
as kind of these four components from a

673
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
two line element set which describe the

674
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
shape

675
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,440
of an object's orbit

676
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,000
and then we will define our fitness the

677
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,919
likelihood that a modification to these

678
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,080
components breeds into the next

679
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
generation of our genetic algorithm

680
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,039
as a metric of how close the

681
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,960
modifications bring our targeted

682
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
individual to the satellite that we're

683
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,440
trying to threaten

684
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,279
finally we'll try to be stealthy so

685
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
we're going to bound how much we can

686
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
change these elements so that we can't

687
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
just completely overwrite them in our

688
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
algorithm and get a member of the

689
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
population who's unrelated to our

690
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,679
original object

691
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,440
if we run this genetic algorithm for a

692
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
couple of hours basically just guessing

693
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,279
checking in that astro dynamic software

694
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
i showed you in the previous slides

695
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,200
we end up with is something that looks

696
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
like this this is an original two line

697
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
element set on the bottom and a

698
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,600
malicious two-line element set on the

699
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,679
top and you can see that we were able to

700
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,840
make very small modifications to the

701
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
malicious two-line element set which had

702
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,559
the effect of pulling us into less than

703
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,200
a kilometer distance from our targeted

704
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
satellite

705
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,360
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

706
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,400
attack

707
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,159
we've got our target satellite iridium

708
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,320
106 and our malicious debris will

709
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,919
propagate for a little while until we

710
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,760
hit that point of collision and you'll

711
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
see these two spheres are each one

712
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
kilometer across and there's pretty

713
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
significant overlap between them

714
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
now the specifics of this attack always

715
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
depend a lot on the models that are

716
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
being used and the data that you have

717
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,840
access to but i think it shows a couple

718
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
of important things about the ssa

719
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,559
environment

720
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
so the first is that third-party data

721
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
about what's in space

722
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,039
requires some degree of trust if you're

723
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
getting key data about the status of

724
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
orbits the key safety data from your

725
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,840
satellite from a third party you need to

726
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,919
understand what risks you're taking when

727
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,880
you're accepting that data at face value

728
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
we've also shown how this trust can be

729
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
abused to have pretty significant

730
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,880
consequences whether that's concealing a

731
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
collision that's on its way or creating

732
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
fake collisions that raise the cost of

733
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
space missions

734
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
finally we've seen how external

735
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
verification and state responsibility

736
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
for the integrity of their data can be

737
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
very important in this domain

738
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
any way to vet the authenticity of ssa

739
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
data even just a handful of telescopes

740
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
or even just having access to two

741
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
databases which you compare to each

742
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
other before trusting a forecast

743
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,080
can dramatically improve the security of

744
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,120
these systems and decrease the threat of

745
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,678
deception

746
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,320
so that was our study on ssa and it kind

747
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,559
of shows us at a high level how someone

748
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
might mess with the orbits of satellites

749
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
to cause physical consequences for space

750
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,159
missions

751
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,679
but let's kind of move a little bit

752
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,679
closer to earth here and talk about a

753
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,679
much cheaper and

754
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,240
simpler attack vector in some ways that

755
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,760
can actually be done by basically anyone

756
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
so we're going to look at how you might

757
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,159
listen to sensitive internet data that's

758
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
coming from modern satellites

759
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
the first thing we need to do is

760
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
understand how these satellites work so

761
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
here's the basic scenario

762
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
we've got a communication satellite in

763
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,360
orbit over the atlantic ocean

764
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,440
there is a cargo vessel

765
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
over

766
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,640
here which is trying to communicate to

767
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,600
the satellite and over the satellite to

768
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
connect to

769
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,720
this google server over here

770
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,279
the way it will do that is via a ground

771
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
station

772
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,679
locate

773
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,080
here in spain

774
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
and we'll also have an attacker down

775
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,200
here

776
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
in

777
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,880
who is trying to intercept the signal

778
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
so let's go ahead

779
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,000
and take a look at what happens when a

780
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,799
message gets sent to this network

781
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
the first thing is you beam up a request

782
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,840
to space saying get me google.com

783
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,799
the satellite is more or less a dumb

784
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,640
bent pipe

785
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,799
it just relays that signal right back

786
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,600
down to earth towards the ground station

787
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
exactly as you sent it

788
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,679
at the ground station

789
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,440
your internet service provider just

790
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
sends the request over the internet as

791
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,840
if they were connected directly on your

792
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,960
behalf

793
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,039
they take the response and beam it back

794
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,279
up to space

795
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,960
this takes a little while to get back up

796
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
to space uh geostationary orbit is

797
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,799
really far the speed of light isn't as

798
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
fast as we might want it to be and so

799
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
you're talking about 500 to 700

800
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
milliseconds round trip latency to get

801
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,880
all the way to space and all the way

802
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,720
back even if everything else in the

803
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
process is perfect

804
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,399
once our signal finally makes it to the

805
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
satellite we'll beam it back down to the

806
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
earth's surface but critically we'll do

807
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
it over an enormous area

808
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,279
so anyone in this area can pick up the

809
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,200
radio waves carrying our signal

810
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,799
we do this because satellites are very

811
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,360
expensive so you want to cover as much

812
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,520
customer area as possible with your

813
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,000
satellite transmissions

814
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,320
but the effect is that our attacker in

815
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,960
ghana can access the same information

816
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
that's going to our customer in the

817
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
atlantic ocean and if this information

818
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
isn't protected against eavesdropping in

819
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
some way it might be used by an attacker

820
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
to gain access to sensitive information

821
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,039
so that's what i tried to do i bought

822
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,880
some inexpensive home television

823
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,960
equipment and i pointed it at about a

824
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
dozen satellites in geostationary earth

825
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
orbit that provide coverage over an area

826
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
that looks something like this so a huge

827
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
chunk of the earth's surface

828
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
and started listening for signals

829
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
and what i found is that the signals

830
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
coming off of these satellites often

831
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
carried inside them unencrypted data

832
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,840
using a protocol called dvbs digital

833
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,000
video broadcasting for satellites

834
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,840
and particularly a layer on top of that

835
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
called gsc or generic stream

836
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,919
encapsulation

837
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,840
now it was actually quite hard to

838
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
understand these signals my equipment

839
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
was very cheap compared to the terminals

840
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,240
that you'd have on a boat or an airplane

841
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,760
and so there were lots of errors in the

842
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,279
data i captured

843
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,279
what i ended up doing is building an

844
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,880
open source tool which you can actually

845
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
check out yourself at this github

846
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,559
repository here

847
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
that basically just focuses on the

848
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
easiest packets to extract from these

849
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,039
corrupted feeds and tries to guess where

850
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,440
i p payloads start and end in the

851
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
protocol so it can extract as much

852
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,159
information as possible for an attacker

853
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
the effect is something like this image

854
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,399
on the right which i intercepted from a

855
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,080
boat where a maintenance worker was

856
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,240
talking about an issue they had on board

857
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
and what you'll see is that i was able

858
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,559
to decode the first chunk of that jpeg

859
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,840
image before my stream was corrupted and

860
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
i wasn't able to recover the rest of

861
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,919
that compressed data but i was able to

862
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,120
get some information

863
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
what sort of information was i seeing

864
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
well i saw traffic from at least nine

865
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
members of the fortune global 500 to

866
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,000
some of the world's largest companies

867
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
traffic from six of the ten largest

868
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
airlines in the world

869
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
traffic from shipping companies which

870
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,799
account for more than 40 percent of the

871
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
world's cargo capacity

872
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
from government agencies uh whether

873
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,600
those be postal services or air forces

874
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,440
and even from regular people who might

875
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
connect to satellite internet at a

876
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,679
remote coffee shop or while on a cruise

877
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,600
within the data there was all kinds of

878
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,760
stuff that raised concerns i saw

879
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
information that raised privacy concerns

880
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,360
things like this email which was

881
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,279
destined towards the captain of a greek

882
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,519
billionaire's super yacht when he forgot

883
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,839
his microsoft account password and was

884
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,599
broadcasting clear text across the

885
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
entire continent of europe

886
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,280
i saw information about crew members

887
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
passport data immigration data that was

888
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,199
being sent to port authorities when they

889
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,800
were planning their next port of call

890
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
likewise there was a lot of operational

891
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,639
technology related to these satellite

892
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,960
networks i saw credentials for wind

893
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
turbines that would allow you to log

894
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,679
into kind of wind turbine administration

895
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,839
panels over the open internet based off

896
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
of the passwords that could be

897
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
intercepted in these satellite feeds

898
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
similarly i saw information related to

899
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
nautical charts telling ships how to

900
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
safely navigate through the oceans a lot

901
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,280
of them

902
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,760
apparently operate over simple ftp

903
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
servers on these little electronic chart

904
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
display systems ecd is

905
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,359
and

906
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,800
these systems if you have the right

907
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,640
credentials you can actually just upload

908
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
fake nautical charts to them and

909
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,119
potentially cause a catastrophe for the

910
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,400
navigation of ships

911
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
in the aviation context i saw a lot of

912
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
information from airplanes both

913
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,880
information that went to the cockpit for

914
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,640
things like electronic flight bags which

915
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,760
help

916
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,079
pilots plan their missions and also

917
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,839
information going to passengers for

918
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,599
things like femtocells which are

919
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
basically miniature cell towers that you

920
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,079
put on an airplane this screenshot on

921
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,480
the right here is an sms text message

922
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
that was destined to a gentleman who was

923
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
on a transatlantic flight and received

924
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,440
his negative coronavirus test results

925
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
mid-flight maybe not even knowing he was

926
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,200
connected to a satellite network but

927
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,640
just connected to the wi-fi or the lte

928
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,640
hotspot on the airplane

929
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,520
so why does this sort of thing happen it

930
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
all comes down to physics right so when

931
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
i started talking about sending signals

932
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
to space we talked about how the speed

933
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,480
of light isn't all that fast and it

934
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
takes a long time to get a signal up to

935
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
a satellite and back

936
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,560
the consequence of that is that certain

937
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,119
protocols like tcp which has a three-way

938
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,280
handshake to start its connections

939
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
get really slow over satellite feeds

940
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
each of those steps of the handshake has

941
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,880
to go through that really slow

942
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,280
geostationary latency

943
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,960
and what internet service providers have

944
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,800
done is they built these tools called

945
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,480
performance enhancing proxies that are

946
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,599
essentially

947
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,000
man in the middle attackers they modify

948
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,040
your tcp traffic to make it faster

949
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
but if you use something like a vpn if

950
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
you encrypt your tcp traffic from end to

951
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,400
end

952
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,760
the internet service provider can no

953
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
longer protect you

954
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
and so many customers i spoke to about

955
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,760
these vulnerabilities said we tried

956
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
using a vpn we tried encrypting our

957
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
signals but it made the connection too

958
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,200
slow so we decided we'd rather have an

959
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,760
insecure connection than no connection

960
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
at all

961
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,520
i've been working a little bit on how we

962
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,359
might make this problem easier to solve

963
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,599
and i'd be really keen to get any ideas

964
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
from y'all basically what i've been

965
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,320
building is something called q pep it's

966
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,880
a sort of vpn design for satellite

967
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
networks which does that man in the

968
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,000
middle tcp optimization over satellite

969
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,320
links and then uses quick which is an

970
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
encrypted udp based protocol

971
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
over the actual space hop in order to

972
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
protect traffic and encrypt it in the

973
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,400
air while still offering a lot of the

974
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,160
performance benefits that you would

975
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,599
expect

976
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,079
from long range satellite communications

977
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,240
from performance enhancing proxies

978
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,839
uh it's actually available it's open

979
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,119
source you can check it out and play

980
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,119
around with it it beats a lot of

981
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,400
traditional performance enhancing

982
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
proxies because of some unique

983
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,920
properties of quick but i think there's

984
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
still a lot of work done to get this

985
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,520
kind of approach rolled out in the real

986
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
world and make it palatable so that's

987
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,119
the sort of networking project that

988
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,119
excites you i'd encourage you to kind of

989
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
sink your teeth into this world of high

990
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,359
latency network security because there

991
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,720
are a lot of tough challenges in this

992
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,960
space that i think haven't yet been

993
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,920
solved as well as they could be

994
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,440
so what do we take away from this

995
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
eavesdropping study

996
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
i think the first is that threat models

997
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
are constantly changing i used very

998
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
inexpensive equipment to listen to

999
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
signals that were being sent and

1000
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,680
received by very expensive equipment and

1001
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,359
that really pulled the rug out from

1002
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,800
under some of the people i gave

1003
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
responsible disclosure to they said you

1004
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,200
know

1005
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,760
we were aware that someone maybe like an

1006
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,359
intelligence agency could listen to our

1007
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,040
signals but we didn't think you could do

1008
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,680
it with such inexpensive equipment

1009
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,359
and it's important to know that in the

1010
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,000
long term it always gets cheaper to hack

1011
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,240
things and so you should never plan on

1012
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
security through cost as something that

1013
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,560
will last very long if something is

1014
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,920
insecure it's insecure

1015
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,400
additionally we've seen how collecting

1016
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
data passively can have active

1017
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,320
consequences yes our satellite dish

1018
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
doesn't transmit anything it only

1019
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,079
listens to the signals we get but if

1020
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,000
those signals contain passwords they can

1021
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,920
be used to do things like login to wind

1022
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,240
turbines or mess with nautical charts in

1023
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,599
a way that can have some pretty serious

1024
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,520
consequences

1025
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,400
finally we've seen how physicality the

1026
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
physical properties of latency and long

1027
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,280
communication distances led to security

1028
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,599
design decisions that had significant

1029
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,680
impact on the safety of these satellite

1030
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
communications networks

1031
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
and that kind of brings me to my

1032
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
computing thoughts for this whole talk

1033
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
because i think if we step back and look

1034
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
at these two case studies there's some

1035
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,240
very obvious themes for satellite

1036
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,880
security that come out

1037
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,599
and the first is that physicality

1038
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
space systems are built to adapt to the

1039
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,760
environments they're in whether it's

1040
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,920
because it's hard to measure uh debris

1041
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
objects so you need to share telescopes

1042
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
with other countries or the data that

1043
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,400
comes from them

1044
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,640
or geostationary signals are really slow

1045
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,320
so you need to ease drop on your

1046
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,560
customers tcp connections to optimize

1047
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
them the physics of space leads to

1048
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,920
security adaptations that raise security

1049
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,240
problems that don't exist on the ground

1050
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,680
but still matter for space systems

1051
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,520
we've also seen how there's a lot of

1052
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,359
value in walking between disciplines

1053
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,280
when we talk about space whether you

1054
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,599
care about the policy how we set norms

1055
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,079
and rules for responsible behavior in

1056
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,760
space and cyber

1057
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
or you care about communications or

1058
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,960
astrophysics or the dynamics of orbit

1059
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,800
there's value in having people from many

1060
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
disciplines working together in space

1061
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,640
security because of the complexity of

1062
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
these problems and because of how space

1063
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,079
touches so many different fields

1064
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,760
finally i think we've learned a lot of

1065
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,000
the value of adaptability thinking of

1066
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,599
ways that we can take existing

1067
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,240
techniques and approaches like quick and

1068
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,119
encrypted udp communications protocol

1069
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,720
and bring them into the space

1070
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
environment in order to improve the

1071
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
overall security of these systems

1072
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,079
without reinventing the wheel from

1073
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,200
scratch

1074
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,560
we're getting quite good at cyber

1075
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
security there are a lot of really

1076
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,720
brilliant people in the field and i

1077
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,240
think if they adapt a little bit of

1078
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
their knowledge to space it can go a

1079
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,000
long way

1080
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
so that's it for me uh happy to answer

1081
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,079
any questions that you might have you

1082
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
can always email me or reach out to me

1083
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,160
on twitter or ask me questions after

1084
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,760
this if there's time

1085
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,599
thanks so much for listening and hope

1086
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
you enjoy the rest of the conference

1087
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,160
hello hello dr pavu

1088
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
so thank you very much uh

1089
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,599
for giving us this talk your talk was

1090
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,359
very well perceived

1091
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,000
and uh um to be honest i have also

1092
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
bought a self set and the 6903 but i

1093
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
could never go that far like you

1094
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,920
so let's see if there's any questions

1095
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,800
from the audiences

1096
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,079
okay so while we are waiting for the

1097
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,720
question i have prepared one for myself

1098
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,200
so since you have mentioned iridium 106

1099
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
in one of your slides um

1100
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,920
how do you find the iridium

1101
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,880
do you find it interesting as a research

1102
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,720
subject or

1103
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,119
if you don't why not

1104
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,960
yeah i think the iridium network is

1105
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,880
really interesting so there's been some

1106
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,520
really cool attacks on iridium that use

1107
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,000
software-defined radios

1108
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,160
it's easier to

1109
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
work with iridium signals because they

1110
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
come from low earth orbit

1111
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
um so you need like the antennas that

1112
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,400
you need to receive them with can be a

1113
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
little bit like smaller bandwidth which

1114
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,160
is useful compared to like the big

1115
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
geostationary satellites

1116
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,880
but um yeah i think there's some aspects

1117
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,200
of like lower orbiting constellations

1118
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
that are really interesting to look at

1119
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,119
for one you have less latency so those

1120
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,280
like speed of light problems i talked

1121
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
about don't matter as much in the

1122
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,680
iridium context but then you have

1123
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
interesting relationships between

1124
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,079
satellites in the constellation because

1125
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,079
um especially when we think about like

1126
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,160
next generation lower constellations

1127
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
like starling

1128
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,200
these satellites will talk to each other

1129
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,119
so it won't just be a single bent pipe

1130
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
up to space and back down but they'll be

1131
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
all kinds of like routing attacks um in

1132
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,560
terms of

1133
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
if you can target specific satellites

1134
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,640
make the network slower or if you can

1135
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,319
like craft messages that get routed in a

1136
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,960
certain way so i think like iridium is

1137
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,880
like one of the early lower orbiting

1138
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,680
internet constellations is a great like

1139
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,200
start for thinking about those sorts of

1140
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,520
problems

1141
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,079
cool uh so i've got a question from the

1142
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,160
internet from slido

1143
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,400
uh so the question reads like uh why

1144
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
don't people just encrypt the data as

1145
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
they send through the satellites so the

1146
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,400
these data cannot be if uh if dropped

1147
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,640
uh i know that you have propelled qpap

1148
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,400
but um

1149
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,839
yeah

1150
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,359
yeah it's it's a great question and it's

1151
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,280
one that i've asked myself over and over

1152
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,319
again

1153
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,480
at basically every step of this process

1154
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,119
from like doing responsible disclosure

1155
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,079
to

1156
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,720
trying to design solutions i think

1157
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,440
they're basically two reasons um one is

1158
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,160
that nobody feels like it's their job to

1159
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,680
encrypt the traffic

1160
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,760
so internet service providers will

1161
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
basically say we don't have an

1162
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
obligation to do anything other than

1163
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,359
like move fights from one place to

1164
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,599
another place and if customers want

1165
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
their data to be encrypted

1166
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,160
will it the customer need to encrypt it

1167
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,640
meanwhile customers will either say they

1168
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,480
have no idea what they're doing right so

1169
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,079
like someone on the cruise ship isn't

1170
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,880
necessarily going to know what using a

1171
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,960
satellite signal means for the threat

1172
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,319
model

1173
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,640
or they'll say we've tried to use the

1174
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
best tools we have available to us

1175
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,920
things like vpns

1176
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,440
but because we don't control the

1177
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,760
underlying infrastructure and protocols

1178
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
those come with unacceptable performance

1179
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,800
trade-offs

1180
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,160
so i think it's

1181
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,400
not that people couldn't use encryption

1182
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,760
i think it's just

1183
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
it's very easy to tell people to use

1184
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
encryption it's sometimes harder to make

1185
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,240
people

1186
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
want to use encryption and then give

1187
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,040
them the tools to be able to do that

1188
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,720
cool thank you very much for the answer

1189
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,800
and i guess the time is up so really

1190
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,480
appreciate your talk thank you very much

1191
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,760
thank you again

1192
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,680
awesome no problem enjoy the rest of the

1193
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,399
conference
