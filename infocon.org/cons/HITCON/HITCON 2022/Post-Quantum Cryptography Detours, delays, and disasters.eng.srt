1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,280
cryptography detours delays and

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,760
disasters

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
um

4
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,960
all right thank you

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,239
let's see if I can move this over to the

6
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,539
acrobat window here

7
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,280
okay

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,320
so we gave a talk on post Quantum

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,619
cryptography at hidcon 20 and it's been

10
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,479
in the news a lot so we're assuming that

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,340
people are generally familiar with it

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,520
but just one slide of a reminder of the

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,740
importance of post Quantum cryptography

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,840
the general situation is you're talking

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,659
to a web server through https and then

16
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,060
TLS transport layer security is supposed

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,979
to be guaranteeing that you're talking

18
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,020
to the right web server and this is

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,640
something that does with a cryptographic

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,159
tool of public key signatures for

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,000
example RSA signatures now it's also DLS

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,180
is supposed to be protecting your data

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,240
against being understood by the attacker

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
the the attacker is listening to

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
everything that you're sending and even

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,820
without pretending to be the server the

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,159
attacker can record your data and look

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,020
at your data and see all your secrets

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,540
and so TLS also uses public key

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,659
encryption for example nist p256

31
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,880
elliptic curve cryptography and this

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
public key encryption is replacing your

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,740
data with encrypted data ciphertexts

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,840
which the attacker has trouble figuring

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,599
out what those psychotypes be now this

36
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,280
public key cryptography public key

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,860
signatures and public key encryption is

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,560
not the only cryptography used in TLS

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,220
because for performance TLS also uses

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,680
symmetric key cryptography which is much

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,020
faster than public key cryptography so

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,580
almost all of the data that you're

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,280
sending is actually encrypted with

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,580
symmetric key cryptography using a

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,520
symmetric key which is secured using

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,580
public key cryptography and also TLS

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
authenticates your data protects it

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,840
against being Modified by the attacker

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,780
using symmetric authentication which is

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,840
well signed using public key signatures

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,780
so there's a little bit of public key

52
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,040
signatures and encryption at the

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,780
beginning of your connection and then

54
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,879
there's lots of symmetric encryption and

55
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,280
symmetric authentication to make sure

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,019
that your data all of your data is

57
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
secure after that if any of these pieces

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,200
are broken then TLS the attacker can

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,440
pretend to be the server or can see and

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,420
understand the data that you're sending

61
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
now this is where the post Quantum

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,800
problem comes in first of all

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,140
as soon as the attacker has a big

64
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,239
quantum computer the attacker can break

65
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,659
rsf and can break elliptic cryptography

66
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,239
and so post Quantum cryptography says

67
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,080
well

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,260
what do we do to make sure that the

69
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,040
attacker we need to replace RSA and well

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,659
elliptic curve cryptography with

71
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,060
something that the attacker cannot break

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,360
all right and so already 2016 I was

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
giving these talks so this is a

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,080
screenshot from a talk I gave him May

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,180
2016 at a conference about

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,180
standardization of cryptography and I

77
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,400
was highlighting how important it is to

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,680
move to postpartum cartography so Dan

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
was already saying that all the

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,860
connections have the public key

81
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,440
component which is broken and so that

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,319
means today's data if anybody's

83
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,260
recording it and we know that there are

84
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,180
large scale attacks which who are

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,739
recalling all the communications going

86
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,440
on then they can decrypt this

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,600
communication from today sometime later

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,639
with the quantum computer and there are

89
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,779
lots of

90
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,120
kinds of data medical records legal

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,639
proceedings State Secrets company

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,940
secrets and so on that have a long data

93
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,979
lifespan where you still want secrecy

94
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,020
for many years and so it's actually very

95
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,880
important to move to post-con

96
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,639
photography sooner than later

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,160
an important message I was giving 2016

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,400
is that we actually have some secure

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
systems

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,759
they're not as convenient as the current

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,220
systems they're somewhat slower somewhat

102
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,979
bigger as you can see at the bottom left

103
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,000
here the logo of the post of the people

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,820
project was taught voice actually a big

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,460
Galapagos tortoise which is not known

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,880
for its agility but it's known for

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,979
living a long time and being very very

108
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,360
solid

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
and so what we were working on was

110
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
making nice and faster ones but people

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
could move to something secure and so

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,560
when I was answering the question about

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,860
like sanitization now or later was that

114
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,840
their arguments in favor of either kind

115
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,600
of standardization now because well it

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
takes a long time and we have to get

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,860
ready

118
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,780
also standardization later would have

119
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,180
arguments namely that we will have

120
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,759
better system to standardize but the

121
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,820
main message I was giving is well yeah

122
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,740
we can start standardization now but

123
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,060
it's really really important to have

124
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,759
sold recommendations so that people who

125
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,280
need to secure their secrets all the

126
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
data that's going on with the wire today

127
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,380
can do so and it was not just talking we

128
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,880
had actually several months before in

129
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,639
September 2015 got together with several

130
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,800
senior people in this project and said

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,759
okay

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,520
if we put our knowledge together all the

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,080
things we know about attacks all the

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,759
things we know about security

135
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,020
what are systems that today well now

136
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,240
that's eight years ago but almost that

137
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,479
we can recommend and say those are solid

138
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,660
systems and so these are the systems

139
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,539
which back then and still today we're

140
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,120
saying these are very secure long-term

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,180
recommendations so for symmetrical coach

142
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,400
actually nothing is changing so much

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,979
well the key size up here for

144
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,460
recommending 256 bit keys so this is

145
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,740
something where you still see a lot of

146
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,960
128 bits but there are many reasons to

147
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,380
move to 206-bit keys anyway and so any

148
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,380
system like as or sell the trendy or

149
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,360
Chacha 20 that you would find today in

150
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,940
the internet anyway useless 256-bit key

151
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,300
indicator same for the Authentication

152
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,919
so these were the last two things on

153
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,020
that side of our TLS also here's

154
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,460
something that we're using currently and

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,199
you're fine and then for public key

156
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,240
encryption the two kinds of systems we

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,940
are recommending were systems that have

158
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,880
aged very well and have been studied for

159
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,100
many many years so those are systems

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,940
from the late 1970s maclease from 1978

161
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,479
and hash based signatures from 1979. so

162
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,880
those were systems which in 2015 were

163
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,060
already look those have been studied so

164
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,940
long time you can just use them

165
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,800
and so well plus that meant we have

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,840
gotten people a good recommendation so

167
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,120
they can go and secure the important

168
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
data and we can do some research on more

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
efficient nicer systems and we thought

170
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,740
okay everything is good

171
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,860
except well let's look at what actually

172
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,599
happened starting in 2016 where Google

173
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,479
did try putting a system out um so

174
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,940
Google in the Chrome browser said let's

175
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,800
try experimenting with post Quantum

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,319
cryptography so they said let's take New

177
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,380
Hope 1024 and this is a post Quantum

178
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,259
system and they put it into the browser

179
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,479
they put it on some of their servers and

180
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,880
did an experiment to see whether it was

181
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,400
working and the experiment seemed to be

182
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,819
going fine now they said they're not

183
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,800
just going to turn off current

184
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,780
cryptography they're not going to turn

185
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,460
off elliptic curve cryptography what

186
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,259
they said was they're going to encrypt

187
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,639
everything with elliptic curve

188
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,379
cryptography and they're going to

189
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,240
encrypt everything with this post

190
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,820
Quantum proposal New Hope and the reason

191
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,520
for that is that if something goes wrong

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
with New Hope if it ends up being

193
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,839
completely broken then well we still

194
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,760
have current security we have elliptic

195
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,100
curve photography still protecting us of

196
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,899
course this is failing to protect

197
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,120
against future quantum computers if that

198
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,339
happens but what hopefully New Hope is

199
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,860
is okay and definitely we still have

200
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,080
current ECC security so they encrypted

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,540
with both pre-quantum and post Quantum

202
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,640
it's very important to consider the

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,980
possibility of these post Quantum

204
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,260
systems being broken because while New

205
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,899
Hope and many other post Quantum systems

206
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,600
these are very new crypto systems this

207
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,640
is very different from what Tanya was

208
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,500
mentioning a moment ago systems from the

209
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,000
1970s New Hope was published in 2015.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,980
using some older pieces but pieces from

211
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,160
2014 and 2010. so really it's very very

212
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,160
new this is when Google rolled it out it

213
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,980
was between one and six years old the

214
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,620
major pieces of this New Hope system

215
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,860
and well being a new crypto system has a

216
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,380
security threat it also means that oops

217
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,720
maybe it's patented because maybe

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,060
somebody actually figured out the ideas

219
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,279
that you're using and filed for a patent

220
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
on it before it was published and while

221
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,420
a patent holder talked to Google and

222
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,279
said hey you're using New Hope and

223
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,080
that's actually a system I have a patent

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,260
on and well a few months later Google

225
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,860
removed New Hope from Google Chrome

226
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,300
now a month after in December 2016 the

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,519
U.S National Institute of Standards and

228
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,140
technology part of the Department of

229
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,220
Commerce nist they said in one year we

230
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,800
want to see proposals of post-quantum

231
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,839
systems to standardize

232
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,019
and they made some different choices in

233
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,420
this call from what Google said so one

234
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,180
choice that they made was you are not

235
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,880
allowed to submit elliptic curve

236
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
cryptography plus some post Quantum

237
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
proposal they said you must not in any

238
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,200
of these submissions have any pieces

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,899
which are going to be broken by a future

240
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,240
quantum computer

241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
for example they said if you have a

242
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
discrete log based encryption mechanism

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,420
that would be elliptic curve

244
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,120
cryptography and you combine that with

245
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
New Hope then that would not be allowed

246
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,500
as a submission and they set up the

247
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,440
submission procedure so that proposals

248
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,860
like New Hope would be evaluated

249
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,620
primarily for pre-quantum security which

250
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,320
is very strange because the goal was to

251
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,899
get post Quantum security after the

252
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,760
attacker has a quantum computer make

253
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
sure that the attacker cannot break

254
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,940
these systems we already have

255
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,220
pre-quantum security what we need is

256
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,720
post Quantum security

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,480
so this was a distraction from the goal

258
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,060
of post-quantum cryptography and this

259
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,160
call for submissions from this had other

260
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,380
distractions for example they had

261
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
certain security categories which is I

262
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,240
don't want to try to explain what these

263
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,860
are but these ended up really

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,500
distracting people from figuring out the

265
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,260
security of these crypto systems

266
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,399
flexibility there were all sorts of

267
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,160
extra constraints on what you should try

268
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,740
to do which were not the basic goal of

269
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,399
protect against future quantum computers

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,920
all right I'm surprised you didn't put

271
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,640
security codes here all right uh

272
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,399
actually some pressure to wait for this

273
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,420
oops yeah I'm supposed to be doing this

274
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,220
slide as well so

275
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,779
um

276
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:06,000
when uh industry for instance Google and

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,980
apple and so on were looking at the

278
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,680
situation after Google had trouble with

279
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,660
the patent and then nist was saying well

280
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,060
we're going to have submissions of

281
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,339
things to standardize nist was saying

282
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,560
things that sound very attractive for

283
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,540
companies one of the things they were

284
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,820
saying was they are going to collect

285
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,980
information from every submitter about

286
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,380
patents on the submissions and this said

287
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,600
they believe it's critical that this

288
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,880
process leads to cryptographic standards

289
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,040
that everybody can use for free so no

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,980
patents and also nist said they would be

291
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,440
prioritizing the security evaluating the

292
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
security so this would give the best

293
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,519
possible guarantees if nothing going

294
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,399
wrong that the security provided by each

295
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,200
submission that would be the most

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,660
important factor in evaluating the

297
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,880
submission and also other

298
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,980
standardization organizations looked at

299
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,500
this and said yeah we'll just wait and

300
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,200
see what Nest is doing for example in

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,139
March 2017 a few months after this was

302
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,459
announcing

303
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,260
um the ietf has their research

304
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,260
organization irtf and inside that cfrg

305
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,779
which handles cryptography they said

306
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,200
well okay there's some some very well

307
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,240
understood things where we're working on

308
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,220
standards but we're going to wait for

309
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,959
nist for everything else

310
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,360
and also ISO decided to wait for this

311
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,980
and lots of Standards organizations

312
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,440
decided to wait for this well not

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,620
everybody so China said we're going to

314
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,600
run our own competition

315
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
which I'm sure is very important for

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
people in China

317
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,279
well for the rest of us the system

318
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,740
addition started in this

319
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,740
well the end of November 2017 was a dead

320
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,920
loving and nist was collecting those and

321
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,620
really see those but some solutions were

322
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,180
already announced by the designers

323
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,260
online

324
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,779
and so during the next few days together

325
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,019
was it was then about PhD students

326
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,540
we were looking at one of the systems

327
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,940
and broke some security aspects of one

328
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,800
of the challenges

329
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,160
and then finally just before Christmas

330
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,019
this made us an ice present so they

331
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,480
posted 69 completely proper submissions

332
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,720
actually very good

333
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,880
participation too many people

334
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,519
um a bit surprising maybe that there

335
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,680
were a few of them which were I would

336
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,200
classify as conservative like based on

337
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,560
very long well studied assumptions then

338
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,480
again we have those already and that

339
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,220
might Rock be rolled out every day now

340
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,860
and so well it's also understandable

341
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,019
that those who want to win empathize

342
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,120
performance

343
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,579
now what do people with an attack

344
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,339
mindset do when they see six nine

345
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,000
submissions also student loans Money

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,740
um when they had and within the few

347
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,160
first few hours broke one of them where

348
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,139
strip breaking means he actually had

349
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,839
like some fighting code just Grand end

350
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,839
of the whole thing uh with transpired

351
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,820
just a few days later together with the

352
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,620
resulting in Logan's we broke another

353
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,880
one

354
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,220
um but no one's broke another one we

355
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,019
broke another one and then some other

356
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,300
people that started jumping in now I

357
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,399
should comment on those these are not

358
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,279
script these are more favorite attacks

359
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,320
but they still show

360
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
um that the designer didn't put the

361
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,620
security level they didn't really

362
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,839
understand how secure the system was and

363
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,779
it somewhat different and so also other

364
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,899
people and well it keeps going you see

365
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,360
like the dates are not that far apart so

366
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,699
the January that was quite a card I mean

367
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,019
you're feeling like okay this is like

368
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,300
capture the flag of competition and

369
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,100
you're just trying to break as many as

370
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,899
possible and just jumped in you see

371
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,720
sometimes it's two groups breaking the

372
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,420
same one or building on it on top of

373
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,560
things

374
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,279
some get broken in a few times

375
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,100
and continues through 2018

376
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,139
okay fine I'm not going to go through

377
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,139
all of these at the end of 2018 early

378
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,079
2019 this was same thing you know

379
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,360
narrowing the field we have these 69

380
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,300
submissions so like a broken 13 in total

381
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,040
we're like broken means there's a script

382
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,660
and there are actually several which

383
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,180
have they have security claims to

384
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,399
disproved as like they were not as

385
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,899
secure that they could keep all the

386
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,240
features what they did is they narrowed

387
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,260
them filled from the 69 26 of secondary

388
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,000
candidates

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
interestingly they kept some of those

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,779
which didn't really understand the

391
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,000
security levels but they felt like there

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,940
were some some benefits then some of the

393
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,240
remaining submissions that were emerging

394
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
um what survived okay none of the really

395
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
broken ones great

396
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
um but there was also a strong bias

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,480
towards those which were faster

398
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,139
so there were at this moment deselecting

399
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,139
some which they perceived as too slow

400
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,600
and well not about to win the beauty

401
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,079
contest

402
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,419
so then what happened after that in 2019

403
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,599
well first of all industry started

404
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,900
working and saying okay actually the the

405
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,059
situation for Rolling Out Post hormone

406
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,780
cryptography has changed a little bit

407
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,720
at the beginning in 2016 Google was very

408
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
enthusiastic and tried rolling something

409
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,619
out and oops ran into trouble with the

410
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,040
patent and then well after that people

411
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,500
saw the missed competition starting and

412
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
then felt like okay niftus is going to

413
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,059
focus on security and give us something

414
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,100
strong and patent-free and that'll be

415
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,679
great but well lots of things were

416
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,059
getting broken

417
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,120
um meanwhile at least nist had published

418
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,740
statements from all the submitters about

419
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,740
what was patented and then some things

420
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,380
were not broken so okay industry for

421
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,539
example open SSH open source software

422
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,120
for doing SSH connections this is the

423
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,940
most popular SSH software and they in

424
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,120
April 2019 added a post Quantum option

425
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
again one of the newer options not

426
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
something which has been around since

427
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,620
the 1970s and while they didn't turn it

428
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,600
on by default they said you you have it

429
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,299
as an option if you enable it in the

430
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,700
client and enable it in the server and

431
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,440
meanwhile people were breaking some more

432
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,539
submissions and well Google and

433
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,600
cloudflare a few months after openssh

434
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
Google and cloudflare said okay okay

435
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
it's time for us to try another post

436
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Quantum experiment and they picked two

437
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,780
of the newer candidates and true hrss

438
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,660
which is a lattice based system and psyc

439
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,780
p434 isogeny basic system and for both

440
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,820
of these they did elliptic curve

441
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,400
cryptography and the post Quantum system

442
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,620
encrypting with both so that if

443
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,260
something goes horribly wrong if one of

444
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,360
these systems is completely broken at

445
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
least we still have elliptic curve

446
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,320
cryptography protecting us and they ran

447
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,900
this experiment and reported useless of

448
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,820
the experiment meanwhile more things got

449
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,580
broken and uh Google in another

450
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,559
department said we have a wonderful

451
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,900
quantum computer they announced Quantum

452
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,760
Supremacy and that scared a lot of

453
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,919
people realizing that yeah okay this is

454
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,780
maybe getting very serious and maybe

455
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,720
within 10 years we'll have a big quantum

456
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,280
computer and maybe attackers will have

457
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,919
it sooner and this is really scary

458
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,660
um okay more and more attacks happening

459
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,340
we're not going to list every uh

460
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,400
possible attack that happens now in um

461
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,460
2020 in the middle of 2020 nist said

462
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,220
okay out of the 26th second round

463
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,580
candidates we'll focus on 15 photos and

464
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,220
which ones did they pick well two of

465
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
this admissions were completely broken

466
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
and they did not take those also five

467
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
more submissions had security claims

468
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,980
disproved and less secure than they they

469
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,600
claimed they were supposed to be and

470
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,480
this did not take any of those Mist took

471
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,640
most of the remaining submissions the

472
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,280
ones that did not have attacks now 16 of

473
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,080
those and well two of those merged so

474
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
they ended up with 15 third round

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,960
candidates list said they are confident

476
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,200
in various systems but I think when nist

477
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,020
says confident they don't mean what I

478
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,059
mean when I say conquered for example

479
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,780
this was saying well if our confidence

480
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,200
in some faster signature systems is

481
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,140
shaken by new analysis in other words if

482
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,720
some signature systems are broken then

483
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,179
well there's this backup Sphinx plus now

484
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,100
that you might remember the Sphinx name

485
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
that was one that Tanya mentioned from

486
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,179
the 1970s okay it went through some

487
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,940
Evolution there was sinks 250 six and

488
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,860
then six plus and I mean various

489
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,080
efficiency improvements for example but

490
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,140
trying to preserve the same security

491
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,760
analysis going all the way back to the

492
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,940
1970s and then meanwhile this was

493
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,980
looking at all these other systems and

494
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,539
saying well

495
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,720
um yeah we're understanding how secure

496
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,940
these systems are for example nist

497
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,520
commented on Rainbow and said the key

498
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,039
point is not that attacks have improved

499
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,539
and may continue improving against

500
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,980
rainbow the point is the analysis is now

501
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,780
improved in a way that matches what we

502
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,700
see in experiment and so we really

503
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,440
understand what's going on with the

504
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,480
security of rainbow and then a month

505
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,460
after that there was a new attack which

506
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,620
was reducing the security level of

507
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,299
rainbow this is one of the signature

508
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,000
systems and then an attack the next

509
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,860
month was against another signature

510
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,080
system and then a faster attack which

511
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
actually was a script breaking the

512
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,520
smallest parameters for rainbow bigger

513
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,740
rainbow parameters are still okay but uh

514
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,480
the smallest ones are much less secure

515
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
than people expect

516
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,360
so maybe yes there is some issue with

517
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,740
sir

518
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,600
better performing signature algorithms

519
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,179
now what do other people do when there's

520
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,520
concerns about things not getting pulled

521
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,039
out Security in general so we got

522
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,900
together with the European cyber

523
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,419
security agency and visa and wrote a

524
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,100
document about the current state of

525
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,919
post-con Photography and the mitigation

526
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,380
of the quantum thread and so if you're

527
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,539
interested in some more constructive so

528
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,860
if you're getting depressed by all the

529
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,260
texts I mean don't get me wrong Edge

530
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,020
hacks are fun but we also have to defend

531
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,659
there is all this data that is being

532
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,000
sent over and it's insecure

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,980
we shouldn't get all distracted by

534
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,900
breaking some wimpses we actually have

535
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,840
to focus on the job of securing some

536
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,820
systems and so we wrote this report so

537
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,380
if you want to get new details about

538
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,919
well what was it what we what were these

539
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,679
15 candidates and how do they work so

540
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,120
there's some some short snippets on

541
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,080
those and also how can one move

542
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,659
um two secure systems so the report is

543
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,880
available on the Visa web page and once

544
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,940
the slides up you can just click there

545
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,820
now what happened after uh after that

546
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,100
well may 2021 open the SD in their ipsec

547
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
software they added a post Quantum

548
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,600
option again was not by default so the

549
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,400
client and server both had to enable it

550
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
but it was there and it was something

551
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,940
that people could try using and protect

552
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,799
themselves against having their

553
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,559
ciphertext intercepted and uh then

554
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,080
broken by Future quantum computers and

555
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,640
at some point the United States

556
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,400
government realized that they do not

557
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,159
like having people using post Quantum

558
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,440
cryptography and so they put out some

559
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,900
announcements first of all the U.S

560
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,640
National Institute of Standards and

561
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,580
Technology said don't let people start

562
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,520
to buy and Implement non-standard

563
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,179
unknown potentially unsecured post

564
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,159
Quantum cryptography because we haven't

565
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
agreed on standards yet now this is very

566
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,500
interesting if you remember what Tommy

567
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,539
was saying at the beginning we want to

568
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,760
have post Quantum cryptography rolled

569
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,860
out now because there are people who

570
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,799
have data which is being exposed now and

571
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,480
this is something where okay we don't

572
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,760
necessarily have some

573
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,520
well small fast systems that we're

574
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,799
confident in but we have some big slow

575
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,480
systems that have been around for a very

576
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,940
long time that we are sure are going to

577
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,100
hold up and those are systems where

578
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,200
that's the best protection we can get

579
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,380
for users who need security now they

580
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,299
need it against future quantum computers

581
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,880
and so let's roll those things up and at

582
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,460
the same time Tanya was saying we should

583
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,500
work our standards for things where you

584
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,600
know get confidence in some vascular

585
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,460
system so that we can get more people

586
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,559
using these things there's no conflict

587
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,380
between having things rolled out now and

588
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,500
having standards but nist was saying do

589
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,840
not use post Quantum cryptography now

590
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,140
which is very very strict NSA United

591
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,480
States National Security Agency said the

592
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,659
same thing NSS customers are reminded

593
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,059
that NSA does not recommend and you're

594
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,400
not allowed to use non-standard

595
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,679
cryptographic algorithms the U.S

596
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,720
Department of Homeland Security said do

597
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,860
not use

598
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,380
post Quantum cryptography industry

599
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,360
products until standardization

600
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,059
implementation and testing are completed

601
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,158
by nist very very strange

602
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,720
at the same time NSA was also saying

603
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,320
that well if you do use post Quantum

604
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,380
cryptography then do not combine it with

605
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,179
elliptic curve cryptography they said

606
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,039
they do not expect to approve

607
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,240
combinations of post-quantum and ECC

608
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,340
crypto systems which is very different

609
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,440
from what Google will say it's a lot

610
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,840
like what nist was doing but why was

611
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,000
nist saying this well interesting

612
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,760
question what does it mean for for NSA

613
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,039
not to approve this well NSA is

614
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,279
controlling U.S government cryptographic

615
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,380
purchasing and if they say they're not

616
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,419
going to approve something then well

617
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,640
that means that vendors companies

618
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,100
selling to the US government are not

619
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,960
able to sell that to the US government

620
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,940
because NSA says no and that really

621
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,159
changes how companies think about where

622
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
they're going to put their resources

623
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,179
into cryptographic development so

624
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,159
doesn't mean there's been a change of

625
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,220
mind from me giving a talk in 2016 and

626
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,400
Google doing 2016 experiments or is it

627
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,340
just a difference between Defenders and

628
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,200
attackers

629
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
so let's see what I was saying already

630
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,880
in the user report that I had on my

631
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,100
previous slides we were having a good

632
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,200
paragraph about hybrids but also

633
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
sometimes some standardization bodies so

634
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,100
NC is the U.S banking standards and they

635
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,559
have a working group I had a document on

636
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,500
post-con photography and they are very

637
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,360
much the opposite of what this has been

638
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
saying and they say well it is required

639
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,600
to use both classical photography and

640
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
post photography method for both

641
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,480
security and acceptance so in their 21

642
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,140
October release they were going exactly

643
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,059
the opposite way the same way as I'm

644
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,120
going the same as Anita is good and also

645
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,600
the French so almost the same but it's

646
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,760
uh

647
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,700
security so this is on scene they have

648
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,340
also a statement from early 20 from late

649
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,820
2021 early 2000 to 2022 where they are

650
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,100
saying that it's actually the other way

651
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,039
around they will not endorse any drop in

652
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,380
replacement so they will only accept

653
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,480
fibers

654
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,340
and it's also interesting that they are

655
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,799
saying well that postponed cartography

656
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,779
is immature

657
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,360
and I think that is correct for most of

658
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
the systems that were stored in this

659
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,679
competition at that point there was some

660
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,659
which are aged well that also

661
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,940
recommended earlier but most of the

662
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,580
systems were rather new and somewhat

663
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,559
understood it

664
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,960
um I also very much like the end of the

665
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,640
recommendation where they're saying this

666
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,620
immaturity should not serve it's an

667
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,900
argument for postponing the first

668
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,380
deployment so they were saying it's very

669
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,500
important to go get going but really

670
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
make sure to combine them use a pre

671
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,980
Quantum system with a postpartum system

672
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,659
all right so

673
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,720
all of these uh

674
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,460
systems were available

675
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,220
um all the the conservative systems were

676
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,620
available in 2015 2016 that's something

677
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,039
people could use but in 2021 end of 2021

678
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,740
people were usually still not using them

679
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,200
well occasional bits of deployment like

680
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,779
you were hearing about open SSH but it's

681
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,299
really most people were not using these

682
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,580
things and then even more arguing about

683
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,039
hybrids and then well nist was delaying

684
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,840
things more and more the most amazing

685
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,419
series of delays was from the end of

686
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,779
2021 this said we're going to select the

687
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,059
first post Quantum standards for chems

688
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,760
that means encryption mechanisms there's

689
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,260
certain technical distinctions but

690
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,940
basically that's public key encryption

691
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,100
we will select our first post Quantum

692
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,600
standards for chems and signatures

693
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,940
around the end of December or sometime

694
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,120
early January well in February they said

695
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,059
we hope to be able to announce not later

696
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,580
than the end of March

697
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,580
meanwhile open SSH said you know we're

698
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,440
just going to turn on post Quantum

699
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,600
crypto on the server by default you

700
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,760
still have to ask for it like the client

701
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,159
administrator has to ask for it or as a

702
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,620
user typing SSH you can ask for it but

703
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,779
at least it's enabled by default on the

704
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,480
server starting with open SSH 8.9 and

705
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,700
meanwhile back at this they said well

706
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
we're not ready to make the announcement

707
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,260
in March but we still expect to make it

708
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,120
very soon

709
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,720
well in April 2016 9.0 turned on post

710
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,620
Quantum crypto on the client by default

711
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,299
what happened on the 127th day of March

712
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,779
in 2022 this year Well nist finally kind

713
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,360
of late March late very late March uh

714
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,000
nist finally announced the winners so

715
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,860
they said they have selected four

716
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,080
algorithms to standardize kyber

717
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,880
encryption based on structured lattices

718
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,220
by lithium signatures based on lattices

719
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,960
Falcon signatures based on lattices

720
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,820
Sphinx plus signatures based on

721
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,899
hash functions

722
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,720
well okay so one thing is different

723
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,760
um but three Lada systems for encryption

724
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,919
and signatures and then one signature

725
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,840
scheme which you might recognize that

726
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,840
space again that is the type of design

727
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,320
going back to the late 1970s and having

728
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,419
security just based on the security of

729
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,779
hash function and well along with these

730
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,399
systems that nist said they're going to

731
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,440
standardize they said well they're

732
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
they're continuing to study four more

733
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,179
systems so out of the 15 that they had

734
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,919
there are four that they picked to

735
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,720
standardize and four more that they said

736
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,520
they're interested in and they're going

737
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,500
to keep looking at these bike and

738
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,899
classic mclees and hqc based on codes

739
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:52,080
and psych which I mentioned before as

740
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,500
this psyc e434 experiment between Google

741
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,620
and cloudflare based on isogenes

742
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,679
now there are some interesting features

743
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,840
of the nist report and the nist

744
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,520
selection in July 2022 127th day of

745
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,700
March 2022. um one of the issues

746
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,740
they said in the report that yeah

747
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,020
patents were a factor in their decision

748
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,059
they didn't say patents were critical

749
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,980
they said it was a factor in their

750
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,260
decision and they negotiated with some

751
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,120
third parties to enter into some

752
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,000
agreements to avoid patents okay so if

753
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,980
you need to spends money buying out a

754
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,779
patent then great that means we can use

755
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,179
it I mean it's maybe not the best use of

756
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,039
tax money but at least if the patent

757
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,840
goes away then everybody's free to use

758
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,059
something

759
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,039
except that the same report says the

760
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,440
Agreements are not done yet if the

761
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,779
Agreements are not executed by the end

762
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,740
of 2022 then maybe this will will choose

763
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,480
entry which was another candidate

764
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,279
instead of fiber

765
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,000
so what this tells the patent holders is

766
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,840
nist is not very good at negotiation

767
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,120
meanwhile what it tells industry for

768
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,299
example apple and so on is well maybe

769
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,140
this kyber that we've selected is not

770
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,200
actually going to be free to use so just

771
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,299
keep delaying more which is the main

772
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,220
message that I mean this is what nist

773
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,200
has consistently been saying is

774
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,679
wait forever to roll out post Quantum

775
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,620
photography example of a response from

776
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,440
Cisco well Scott Fleur and Cisco is

777
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,799
until we see what has been signed we

778
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,159
cannot use kyber and if the situation is

779
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,080
like this in the future we're going to

780
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,059
need to do something different

781
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,980
well at least he's looking for

782
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,360
alternative Solutions

783
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,740
now

784
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,140
about these backups so in the market

785
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,480
you're actually really month where we

786
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
are waiting for this to announce because

787
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,880
I mean they said late December early

788
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,940
January and then kept delay until late

789
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,880
March there were several articles that

790
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,520
were well reporters interviewing people

791
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,320
from this so for instance nature at an

792
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,059
article where somebody interviewed

793
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,559
Dustin Moody

794
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,659
um the head of this the postponed

795
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,419
project at nist and so he was saying

796
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,840
that they would have some reserves but

797
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
they're also standardize in case the

798
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,100
First Choice ends up being broken by the

799
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,720
unexpected attack

800
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,700
so there it sounded like that you'd have

801
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,100
two algorithms for each application so

802
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,260
publicly encryption would have two and

803
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,600
signatures would have to

804
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,419
and similarly even in June there was an

805
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,039
interview whereas they're saying they

806
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,559
don't want to put all X gasket and only

807
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,019
have that to solve with us and well then

808
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,340
that is the space and they have nothing

809
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,760
else which is a little bit strange when

810
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,860
you see what they posted actually a few

811
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,980
days later namely three out of four

812
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,519
being based on lattices and three out of

813
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,799
four being encryption as signatures and

814
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,559
only one encryption person there is no

815
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,360
fault

816
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,059
and I was saying before that crucial the

817
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,240
thing where to get right now signature

818
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,679
well I didn't even talk about the

819
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,960
urgency of signatures encryption is the

820
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,540
thing where today our data goes over the

821
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,820
wire and everything which is weak then

822
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,859
the attack has all our data it doesn't

823
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,899
matter the later on might get a better

824
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:21,300
encryption system if today's system is

825
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,540
broken

826
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,560
there are four more systems in round

827
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,080
four those are public key encryption

828
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,899
systems so we might get more selection

829
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,060
after round four but that will be

830
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,280
delayed by what another two years till

831
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,280
decision and another two years

832
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,159
um till the standards written so 2024 we

833
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,899
would know what it is and then another

834
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,480
two years for the standard

835
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,260
so something goes very strangely here

836
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,359
and let me come on the stability of of

837
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,580
lattices so I'm then has highlighted the

838
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,918
novelty but let me also talk about the

839
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,960
ability of systems

840
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,140
so what you see in this graph is the uh

841
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,500
so for cryptosystem the asymptotic

842
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,760
security

843
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,480
from 1978 till 2022. we'll be looking

844
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,119
while we're scaling it by the security

845
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,520
actually should be 2022 I'm sorry it

846
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,440
didn't update the number there so by the

847
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,740
current security and the ratio of the

848
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,220
current accounts so if if they attack

849
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,720
asymptotically doesn't improve you see a

850
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,240
nice horizontal line

851
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,160
so is this actually what happened with

852
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,920
lattices well not quite this is actually

853
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,839
the story from at least for code based

854
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,760
system from the 70s which I sort of

855
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,440
already gave away by saying letters is

856
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,180
not New York what you see Miss lettuce

857
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,980
is quite a different shape so let us

858
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,900
start over here

859
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,700
much much higher security compared to

860
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,859
now the ratio is facing infinity and

861
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,079
then come down and come down and down

862
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,480
down again so the last the last decade

863
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,900
that was like 42 higher security level

864
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,020
in 2010 than today

865
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,700
now

866
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,099
if you go into the systems that are

867
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,960
actually standardized on it not always

868
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,960
notice they're even having more

869
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,720
universes these are the basic

870
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,700
lettersections

871
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,300
all right so let us just have

872
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,780
come down and security quite noticeably

873
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,119
so maybe this is what Miss meant when

874
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,099
they wrote in the report that our

875
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,079
understanding of the concrete security

876
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,660
of letters-based crypto systems has

877
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,720
greatly improved over the past several

878
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,259
years

879
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,260
another interesting feature of the

880
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,040
nist's report was what they said the

881
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,700
goal was if you go back to 2016

882
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,760
call for submissions from this then they

883
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,040
said that as I mentioned before the most

884
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,839
important factor in evaluating

885
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,540
sufficients is security and the reason

886
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,579
for that right at the beginning of the

887
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,680
document they say the goal of post

888
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,660
Quantum cryptography is to develop

889
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,820
cryptographic algorithms that would be

890
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,040
secure against Quantum and of course

891
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
classical computers I mean we already

892
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,339
have something that the new part is the

893
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,900
quote Department we already have

894
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,700
something which is safe pre-quanton

895
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,339
namely elliptic cryptography so okay if

896
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,320
the goal is to develop something secure

897
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,540
then obviously security is the most

898
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,040
important factor and they say it's the

899
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,960
most important factor and then they also

900
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,940
list a bunch of other things I mentioned

901
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,579
distractions and they said for example

902
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,800
if your security is good and if your

903
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
performance is good I mean they were

904
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,220
imagining that everything would be fine

905
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,400
with security instead of a tax attacks

906
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,780
attacks attacks everything losing

907
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,880
security they were thinking they're

908
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,740
going to be fine with security and so

909
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,900
they can ask for extra features security

910
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,380
and performance vegetables stretch goals

911
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,300
yeah extra flexibility and then example

912
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,520
4c1e in the golfer's admissions of

913
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,099
flexibility which is preferable if

914
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,200
you've got everything else is they said

915
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,660
that your system can be incorporated

916
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,500
into existing protocols requiring as few

917
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,500
changes as possible which you can

918
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,780
interpret in various ways about like how

919
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,400
small things are whether they fit into

920
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,140
packets for example

921
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,180
um there's various interpretations but

922
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,640
in any case this was an extra feature

923
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,280
because Mist did not realize that the

924
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
main problem was for security Now

925
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,859
um of course it's very important to have

926
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,079
post Quantum crypto rolled out on the

927
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:28,920
internet

928
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,200
but that doesn't mean that we're leaving

929
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
protocols unchanged we have to change

930
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,940
the software to use new crypto and the

931
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,040
exact changes to the software okay if

932
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,900
it's fewer changes that that's that's

933
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,900
better but it it's not an important

934
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,480
thing what's important is security

935
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,060
now if you look at nist's latest report

936
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,320
from July or very late March 2022 then

937
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,140
they say the goal of post Quantum

938
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,119
cryptography this is an exact quote from

939
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,880
the report it read it it's amazing the

940
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,339
goal of post Quantum cryptography is not

941
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,980
security the goal is to develop systems

942
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,160
that can be deployed on the internet in

943
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,660
your current protocols without

944
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,839
significant modifications

945
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,359
okay it's nice to have that if you can

946
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,300
have that but if this is uh I mean if

947
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,520
there's a tension if there's a conflict

948
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,460
between how many protocol changes you

949
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,280
have and security then you have to

950
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,140
prioritize security and that's something

951
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,380
they did in 2016 and they changed that

952
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,700
in 2022.

953
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,320
this is a picture of how nist is

954
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,780
handling their goals for post Quantum

955
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,700
pure doctor

956
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,520
all right well it's been a bit more than

957
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,660
a month since

958
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,660
the Iran Force started so how about the

959
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,780
tax and actually

960
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,260
um yeah there has been a little bit of

961
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,940
interesting stuff happening so remember

962
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,240
that the round four has three code based

963
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
and this one isotony based system and on

964
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,800
the 30th of July castigated were

965
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,780
announcing a preliminary version but

966
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,460
they were like well it's kind of

967
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,200
important to get this out so our paper

968
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,160
isn't fully written but we have a script

969
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,099
which breaks all proposed parameters

970
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:23,280
like on laptop

971
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,160
and then over the next few days Giacomo

972
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,800
Pope was writing a pastor script in Sage

973
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,420
because the first one needed map which

974
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,640
is not free and of course if you can

975
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,380
write it in Sage it's better and then

976
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,200
several other people joined in and it's

977
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,320
gotten faster more people

978
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,020
generalized the attack actually the next

979
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,359
one might be on Martindale had started

980
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,200
this independent office

981
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,440
they were actually describing speed UPS

982
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,119
so um to show you the effects of well

983
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,820
first of all cast implementation and

984
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,940
also the improvements from the Obama we

985
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,500
don't think and so on so the um

986
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,740
this is the column which was secured to

987
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,880
level one

988
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,760
so this is a real submission to the nist

989
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,680
proposal and this is like the highest

990
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,500
proposal for this security levels Those

991
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,020
Were Meant to resist not just current

992
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,900
computers not just well biggest cluster

993
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
you can imagine for many years but even

994
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,280
quantum computer and by now the level

995
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,099
one is down to 22 seconds and the

996
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,440
biggest one is down to one hour on job

997
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,300
well so I might be sounding quite

998
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,980
similar to what I was saying earlier

999
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,380
when I now read out that our

1000
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,000
understanding of the concrete security

1001
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,480
of Psych has greatly improved over the

1002
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,660
last days

1003
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,579
so

1004
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,339
this is an example of a disaster for

1005
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,800
psych and in general when something gets

1006
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,780
broken it's a disaster for that crypto

1007
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,480
system and a disaster for anybody using

1008
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,420
the crypto system but the real disaster

1009
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,339
is that in 2022 we're still not even

1010
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,280
trying to protect user data there's a

1011
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,040
few exceptions like openssh but most

1012
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,980
applications are not even trying to roll

1013
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,320
something out and I mean if something

1014
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,180
gets rolled out and it goes wrong then

1015
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,900
that's that's bad but maybe we managed

1016
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,579
to roll something out which is safe and

1017
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,040
we've had some systems which have been

1018
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,560
studied since the 1970s and they're not

1019
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,359
that expensive we could just use those

1020
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,520
even if there's some applications that

1021
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,859
can't afford those then well try

1022
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,780
something and that's what we've been

1023
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,780
completely failing to do so user data

1024
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,000
right now is being intercepted by

1025
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,220
attackers and as soon as they have

1026
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,900
quantum computers they will be breaking

1027
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,780
ECC and then under standing what all the

1028
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,960
all the confidential user data sets

1029
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,839
all right we have two more slides but in

1030
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,220
the interest of time maybe I'll just

1031
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,859
briefly say that one slide is saying

1032
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,500
what you can do now which is you can try

1033
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,660
rolling something out I mean make sure

1034
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,380
you tpcc but you can attach some

1035
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,319
postponed proposal to ECC and then make

1036
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:20,940
sure you do this in a way which is

1037
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,680
preserving the security of both there's

1038
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,420
more detailed documents that will

1039
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,460
explain what exactly you should be doing

1040
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,020
here to make sure that you're safe and

1041
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,760
that you're encrypting using both

1042
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,380
systems and the attacker has to break

1043
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,300
both or you're signing using both

1044
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,920
systems and then the attacker has to

1045
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,380
break both make sure you verify both

1046
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,140
signatures and then for choosing systems

1047
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,200
well it's safest to choose the systems

1048
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,900
that have been around since the 1970s if

1049
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,240
you really cannot afford that then well

1050
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,280
try rolling out something else and

1051
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,200
hopefully it's okay it's it's of course

1052
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,079
more dangerous but at least try and then

1053
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,180
maybe we managed to protect you today

1054
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,040
and then the last slide is just a bunch

1055
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,359
of links and we'll have that in the

1056
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,040
slides online thank you for your

1057
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,279
attention

1058
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,079
um so thanks for the um Grace that's

1059
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,400
great uh talk um so um I guess um due to

1060
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,140
time constraint we probably can have

1061
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,940
only one question so

1062
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,819
um uh does anyone um from on-site wants

1063
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,359
to ask a question

1064
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,380
um

1065
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,720
if not I guess I'll I'll pick one of the

1066
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,000
questions from from online

1067
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,440
um so um

1068
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,060
so um like previously you have mentioned

1069
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,140
about the anasti shifting their goals so

1070
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,859
um

1071
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,780
So like um

1072
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,300
uh do you feel that they should what

1073
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,819
else do you think they should do instead

1074
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:52,880
um

1075
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,160
so I mean we were hoping that they would

1076
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,040
prioritize Security in their choices and

1077
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,800
we were also lobbying for saying that

1078
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,680
they could standardize some systems soon

1079
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,900
where they have confidence and then

1080
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,700
continue on those with lower confidence

1081
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,980
and instead they've been going for those

1082
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,980
which are convenient to roll out but are

1083
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,700
not really well started and well then of

1084
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,920
course what we're recommending is to use

1085
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,619
it with highways what Anisa the French

1086
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,560
ANSI the American anti and basically

1087
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,119
everybody other than the US government

1088
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,700
is recommending this Studios hybrid

1089
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,280
schemes and I wish that list would

1090
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,920
listen and switch to that

1091
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,380
um so in essence um it is not very wise

1092
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,339
to kind of just roll out one of the not

1093
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,380
not very proven secure

1094
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,540
um algorithms

1095
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,020
well

1096
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,780
if you come before the better ones use a

1097
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,500
good combination of ECC and whatever you

1098
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,180
can afford

1099
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,160
our choice wouldn't necessarily have

1100
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,339
been kyber I say that flat out but I

1101
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:10,440
mean it is still better to roll it out

1102
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,540
now than to wait for another two years

1103
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,220
until this has finally written the

1104
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,400
standard so they're still even with

1105
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,200
their choices there's better things one

1106
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,940
can do than what they're currently out

1107
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,119
for

1108
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,560
okay um great thanks so

1109
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,200
um your slides will be made available as

1110
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,000
in you're willing to publish the slides

1111
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,839
right

1112
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:32,339
um

1113
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:35,400
so um uh if any of the audience wants to

1114
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,359
contact

1115
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:38,040
um uh the speakers

1116
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,220
um there's emails on the slides right

1117
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,500
um we'll post it and he'll also be on

1118
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,380
other systems later today okay cool um

1119
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,140
so thanks um I think uh that that's it

1120
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,140
for um this this talk and um that's um

1121
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,520
thank them again with the round of

1122
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,880
applause
