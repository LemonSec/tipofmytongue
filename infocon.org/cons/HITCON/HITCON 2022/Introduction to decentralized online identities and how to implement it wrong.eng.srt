1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,360
the introduction to decentralized online

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,860
identities and how to implement

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,239
implement it wrong

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,580
um

5
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,579
hello hello hi everyone uh my name is

6
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,620
alien and today I'm going to talk about

7
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,500
the ayata travel pass and the

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,719
interesting system that uh that goes

9
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,099
behind it that's called the the

10
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,860
self-sovereign identity and this session

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,180
uh I do not allow a recording uh either

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,360
video or audio or taking photos of

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,939
anywhere and the the slides will be

14
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,860
released after the talk uh

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
okay

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,200
um a little bit of self-introduction uh

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,140
my name is alien I'm a researcher at the

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,720
at assist the the citizen lab University

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,579
of Toronto

20
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,240
um my research focuses on fighting

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,720
security and privacy problems in popular

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,619
mobile applications uh in the past my

23
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,740
most probably most famous

24
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,780
research was conducted on Tech talk and

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,659
doin that attracted a lot of media

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,920
coverage

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,520
um

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,180
so when when covet started

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,780
um

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,600
a lot of apps were introduced either to

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,060
do contact tracing or

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
uh vaccine passwords uh yeah where you

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,239
you know the the Taiwanese uh contact

34
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,319
tracing app something like those and so

35
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,760
the the app I'm going to talk about

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,540
today the Iota travel pass is is one of

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,040
them

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,819
um

39
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,800
so

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
um but it's not just a covet related app

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,680
it is it has a very interesting system

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,120
behind it so uh that is uh like one of

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,239
the major topic of my talk today

44
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,080
and

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,959
um yeah and and

46
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
uh in my after work time I also uh

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,900
volunteer as digital security trainer

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,959
for civil society organizations and I'm

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,480
also a Linux desktop user and a fast

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,940
contributor

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,319
okay a little bit on the the citizen lab

52
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,340
um

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,040
citizen lab is a interdisciplinary

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,099
research laboratory uh in the University

55
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,000
of Toronto and we combine practices from

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,459
political science and law and computer

57
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,239
science and area studies uh combine them

58
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,720
to to do our research and so other than

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,959
mine research there are also other very

60
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,760
cool and interesting research Topics by

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,300
my colleagues so uh I highly encourage

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,720
you to take a look and probably our main

63
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,900
most famous research is about the the

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,319
Pegasus malware developed by the NSO

65
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,260
group in Israel

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,480
those are this this is also one of our

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,420
research topics not by me but my by my

68
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,840
colleague is that focusing on the the

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,780
digital Espionage uh targeting the Civil

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,599
Society organizations and we also look

71
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,260
at what I think our Taiwanese audience

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,319
would find interesting is the freedom of

73
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,599
online expression

74
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,099
um such as my colleague studied the the

75
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,100
censorship mechanism of the the Chinese

76
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,238
uh in some messaging app WeChat

77
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,680
so I think these are very interesting

78
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
research and I encourage you to take a

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,460
look

80
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,000
um so uh to the topic uh first I'm going

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to introduce you to the Iota travel pass

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,360
the Iota travel pass so so since covet

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,360
started uh many countries have began

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
imposing travel restrictions for example

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,740
you must test negative on a PCR test in

86
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,080
order to travel to the country

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,960
um so ayata travel pass is a mobile

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,600
application that is available on IOS and

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,220
Android that allows you to to receive

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,400
digital test results and share those

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,259
digital test results

92
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,259
um with the airport authorities

93
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,600
so to use the Iota travel pass

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,520
at the ITP first the user would have to

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,000
register on in the app by launching the

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,600
app and then completing the uh the the

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,699
registration process which involves

98
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,940
scanning their passports and completing

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,580
a liveness test because the app wants to

100
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,759
make sure that the user I mean the the

101
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,180
the the the the thing standing in front

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,400
of the of the phone camera is not a

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,620
photo uh they they will ask you to for

104
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,960
example tilt your head uh move your head

105
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,000
so that to prove that or blink your eyes

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
to prove that you are a real live person

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,380
and then they will allow you to continue

108
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,720
to register and

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,000
um after completing the registration the

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,080
user can now proceed to go to a covid-19

111
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,139
uh testing Laboratory uh and at the

112
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,660
laboratory they will the the user will

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,759
register with the laboratory essentially

114
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,199
signing up for a test and uh and the the

115
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,720
lab will use the identity created

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,060
in the ITP app

117
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,960
and after the the lab uh the the

118
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,139
covid-19 test results has been processed

119
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,500
uh the when the lab wants to issue a

120
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,639
um

121
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,240
uh digital covid-19 test result it will

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,600
send the digital test results via ITP

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,900
into the user's ITP app and then once

124
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,340
the user receives the digital test

125
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,100
result they can store it on their phone

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,340
and they can carry it along with them on

127
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,319
their phone and then when they go to the

128
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,080
airport when I check in at the airline

129
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,660
desk they can they can show uh they can

130
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,940
show to the to the to the staff that I

131
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,280
have been tested negative

132
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,259
okay

133
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,720
um the the interesting thing about ITP

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,979
is that

135
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,039
um it's not it usually it uses a very

136
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,900
novel

137
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,840
um technology called

138
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
self-sovereign identity

139
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,199
uh which is which I'm going to talk

140
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,940
about next

141
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,720
and so before we talk about the the uh

142
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,819
self-sworn identity we can first look at

143
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,699
conventional online identity systems

144
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,440
um the the most common one would

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,940
probably be oauth so in oauth

146
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,020
users would entrust their uh private

147
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,319
information to the identity provider

148
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,060
commonly Facebook and Google and apple

149
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,319
you know all these Giants and whenever a

150
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,560
application needs some user user data

151
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,720
they will

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,120
um ask you the use of open permission

153
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,099
and then the user will will tell the

154
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,199
identity provider that whether some

155
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,860
application is allowed to um

156
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,819
to receive which identity which data

157
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,520
items and once the permission is given

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,000
the the application can contact the

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
identity provider and retrieve the user

160
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,220
data from from the identity provider so

161
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,960
this is how conventionally it works and

162
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,280
the SSI is designed to replace this

163
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
system

164
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,940
sorry

165
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,958
okay so before we look into SSI let's

166
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,779
first look at how identities in real

167
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,000
world Works in this example I'm going to

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,979
take the the driver's license as an

169
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,180
example

170
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,920
the

171
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,700
um

172
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,420
so the governments they issue driver's

173
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,180
licenses and car plates which are called

174
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,920
credentials in SSI and they issue those

175
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,500
credentials to to either a holder which

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,140
is the driver and also the car that

177
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,140
holds the car plate so here

178
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,339
um

179
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,519
uh uh yeah so so here essentially the

180
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,860
the the car and the driver holds the

181
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,339
credential and uh because the the car is

182
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,820
not it's not alive as a person so we we

183
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,220
call that it's kind of like a robot so

184
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,140
it only holds the the carplay but

185
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,839
there's nothing else but it does hold

186
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,820
some kind of credentials so we call that

187
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,800
an agent in SSI and at last the the the

188
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,240
police which is the verifier can verify

189
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
those credentials carried by the holder

190
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,500
the driver uh or on the agents which is

191
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,740
the car so imagine you're driving your

192
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,019
car and and and and driving along the

193
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,080
highway and the police pulls you over so

194
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,120
essentially this is this this is what

195
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
happens in in real life right and the

196
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
police can look at your car's plate and

197
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,080
number plate and they they can verify

198
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,660
that whether these plate is valid still

199
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,000
valid and and you you fight all your

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,060
taxes for example and uh and they can

201
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,399
also verify uh your your driver's

202
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,500
license to to make sure that you have

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,540
the uh

204
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,019
you are licensed to drive this vehicle

205
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,260
so the SSI the Self Storage identity

206
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,839
systems look very similar to the to the

207
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
real world identity systems uh that is

208
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,580
the the driver's license so

209
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,260
um as I mentioned the the driver's

210
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,260
license is essentially a credential and

211
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,680
you can also call it a certificate those

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,720
certificates those credentials contain

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,420
certain statements and those statements

214
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,600
can be about anything about anyone so

215
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,180
for example it can say that you are

216
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,820
tested covet negative and you can also

217
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,680
say that you are a member of this for

218
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,140
example Airline

219
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,420
mileage program it can be a lot of

220
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,240
things and it can also be for example

221
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,360
that your your college diploma from some

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,680
University

223
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,820
yeah so uh the the issue are essentially

224
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,100
the issuer can issue any credential to

225
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,680
any user and

226
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,399
um the the agents are robots or programs

227
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,339
that can act on behalf of the user uh

228
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,920
which is also like authorized by the

229
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
user to perform these actions such as

230
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,800
cars and mailboxes so mailboxes receive

231
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,200
uh messages on behalf of the user and

232
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,360
then relay the messages to the user

233
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,500
afterwards so and also the the verifier

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,079
will can request credentials from the

235
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,180
user or request credentials from the

236
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
agent and also verify those credentials

237
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,339
yeah and and At Last I want to point out

238
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,360
that the the SSI is a it only refers to

239
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
a category of Technologies and standards

240
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,660
rather than a spec a specific one so

241
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,399
there are many many implementations of

242
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,140
SSI and also a a key observation is that

243
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,380
SSI is built upon the exchange of

244
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,420
credentials that is the the the the the

245
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,339
major

246
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,160
bit difference from uh the conventional

247
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,519
online identities

248
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,240
okay so uh to implement SSI we only need

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,480
we also need a data registry and it is

250
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,959
often but not necessarily A blockchain

251
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,720
and the blockchain the data registry uh

252
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,760
serves to facilitate peer communication

253
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,860
and it also serves as a revocation

254
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
registry to to to to to

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,360
um to allow the verifier to verify

256
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,519
whether certain credentials are revoked

257
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,639
or not and the the data registry also

258
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,459
does not hold any private data so for

259
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,700
example the the when when a driver is

260
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,540
issued a a driving license uh the the

261
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,240
driving license is never uploaded to the

262
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
to the data registry

263
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,180
and the the next component of SSI is

264
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,579
verifiable credentials

265
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,760
so the as I mentioned the credentials in

266
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,339
SSI we have the the knowledge of we have

267
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,800
the concept of credentials but uh they

268
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,139
are not just like normal credentials

269
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,500
they are verifiable so

270
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,660
um the verifiable credential is a double

271
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,740
3C standard uh it contains uh mostly

272
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,360
three parts

273
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,820
um the the most important part is the is

274
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,519
the yellow part the claims which are the

275
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,800
the statements that I mentioned the the

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,720
statements of the of the credential that

277
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,720
says something uh about the subject for

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,760
example the say some saying that you

279
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,860
graduated from a college and there are

280
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,680
also credential metadata uh like issuer

281
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,519
dates and schema and there are also uh

282
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,860
attached proofs to prove that these

283
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,200
claims are true and these proofs are

284
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,480
usually cryptographic yeah

285
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,820
uh but I'm not going to go into the

286
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,160
detail of the cryptographic area that

287
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
yeah I don't have the time

288
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,899
um and let's go back again to look at

289
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,820
what goes on the on the blockchain so

290
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,639
uh so once we understand the verifiable

291
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,160
credentials um uh these are the

292
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
information that goes on the data

293
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,380
registry uh which includes names and

294
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,420
public key resolution and there are also

295
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,160
credential schemas for example there

296
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,680
might be a schema for that goes under

297
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,959
their registry that says for example

298
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,320
College dipole Master contain field a b

299
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,680
c and d things like this and there's

300
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,440
also a revocation registry which is kind

301
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,380
of special uh as it is you I think it is

302
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,240
uh to my knowledge is implemented with

303
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,339
zero knowledge proofs and it is

304
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,500
essentially you can imagine as a

305
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,040
compound compound hashing function and

306
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,860
um the the verifier can can download the

307
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,560
hash value and using some cryptographic

308
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,440
magic they can know that whether this

309
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,360
credential has been revoked by the

310
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,380
issuer and this is all done so the the

311
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,959
verifier uh can download the the value

312
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,060
but the data necessary that blockchain

313
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
notes will not be able to know that

314
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,920
which credential and which issuer that

315
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
you are actually trying to verify so

316
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,860
this is kind of cool

317
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,019
and there are also public credentials

318
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,760
that goes on the data registry for

319
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,220
example the like public what really

320
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,260
pretty public ones like a company

321
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,940
registration

322
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,899
yeah

323
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,519
and so back to iata travel pass how does

324
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,040
iota travel pass use SSI to implement

325
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,519
their their functions so here

326
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,240
um again we see a a show you a

327
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,300
um the the Samo graph that has the other

328
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,360
other actors in The SSI so the the as I

329
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
mentioned the the Laboratories issue

330
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,300
covetash results and so the the labs are

331
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,240
essentially the issuer of the credential

332
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
and the credential is the cover test

333
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,940
result and the ITP app also issues a

334
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,579
credential to itself which is the

335
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,459
digital password that is issued during

336
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,940
the creation of your account in ITP and

337
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,040
there's also the mailbox that because

338
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,920
you you can imagine uh when the user

339
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,620
uses ITP the the phone will not always

340
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,139
be online right but the the laboratory

341
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,959
might need my my complete processing of

342
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,660
the of the covet test result at any time

343
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,060
right so there needs to be a mailbox so

344
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,360
that the lab can send the test result to

345
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
um without

346
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,579
um

347
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:49,019
uh uh uh so without loss when the user

348
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,420
is offline so that is the the the task

349
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,220
of the of the mailbox the agent and uh

350
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,579
when during verification the ITP also

351
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,980
sends the the test results and the

352
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,199
digital password for to the airline

353
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,260
which is the verifier to to to complete

354
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,119
the the verification and the there's the

355
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,280
the

356
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
specific system using the specific SSI

357
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,640
system using ITP is called Sovereign and

358
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,839
it is

359
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
um also a blockchain system so the

360
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,760
debuggling serves as a the the data

361
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,679
registry

362
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,220
okay so again uh let's compare the the

363
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,039
the the the the the flow the user flow

364
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,620
and the technical flow of the of the

365
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,039
itps operation so when the user

366
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,020
registers on the ITP by scanning their

367
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,000
passports and completing the liveness

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,179
test is essentially itpc is essentially

369
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,340
creating a self-asserted verifiable

370
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,700
credential to itself and when the user

371
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,640
goes to the laboratory to to to to to

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,600
um uh to register for a covert test uh

373
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,240
it essentially ITB establishes a

374
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,480
connection with the laboratory and third

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,620
when the lab sends a completed covid-19

376
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,960
test result to the user it is

377
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,280
essentially sending a verifiable

378
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,900
credential to the user

379
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,360
and also at last when the airport staff

380
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,400
is trying to verify the digital test

381
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,580
result uh the the airport staff and ITV

382
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,460
has to First establish a connection

383
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,320
which is a facilitated as I mentioned

384
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,440
facilitated by the data registry to to

385
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,340
build the connection and and once the

386
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,620
connection has been established the the

387
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,840
airport staff the verifier will request

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,620
uh uh verifiable credential of a

389
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,919
particular schema and the ITP will

390
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,919
prompt the user to to to whether you

391
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,440
would like to share this uh credential

392
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,720
to to the verifier and if the user says

393
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
yes and then the the VC is sent over to

394
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
the verifier

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,720
okay so what what does the the the lab

396
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,700
registration look like so this is from

397
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,160
one of the the iota's

398
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,500
um uh demonstration videos so

399
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,539
essentially you scan a QR code the QR

400
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,179
code contains something like this to the

401
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,960
right this is a invitation to build a

402
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,539
connection and the connection in SSI in

403
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,059
Sovereign is special is it's built using

404
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,940
a protocol called Aries

405
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,480
and when the user scans the QR code the

406
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,440
uh the app will prompt this screen

407
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,360
asking the user to share data to allow

408
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,120
sharing of the data or do not shoot data

409
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,179
and now I'm going to talk more on

410
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,600
Sovereign so Sovereign is is one of the

411
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,240
SSI systems and it is composed of a few

412
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,080
parts uh but I so so therefore the the

413
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,880
verifiable credential part essentially

414
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,960
defines the the the the file format and

415
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,179
the yeah in the fields that go into that

416
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,640
to for for a few for a credential to be

417
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,679
verifiable and secondly it also

418
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,100
comprises of the areas protocol which uh

419
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,480
which is designed to uh to transport the

420
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,059
exchange of uh verifiable credentials

421
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,280
and third there is the decentralized

422
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,320
identifier standard

423
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,059
um

424
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,059
which is there sort of like in the place

425
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,620
of DNS to to resolve uh

426
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,520
special decentralized names into real

427
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,620
https endpoints and there's at last

428
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,419
there's The Sovereign blockchain that

429
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,000
serves the facilitating communication

430
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,620
and as revocation registries

431
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay so

432
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,240
um because this is too too much detail

433
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,520
so I'm going to skip most of it

434
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,179
um so Aries is a as I said it's it's a

435
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,020
it's a protocol that is designed to uh

436
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,720
uh facilitate the exchange of verifiable

437
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
credentials and uh it is on a similar

438
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,380
level it is on a similar level to oauth

439
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,720
uh so it operates uh based on https and

440
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,000
it defines a set of actions that could

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,100
be taken by actors

442
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,559
and and the processes of for example

443
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,720
authorization

444
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,919
and uh so to the top left this is what

445
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,260
the the what a decentralized identifier

446
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,240
looks like

447
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,880
and the Sovereign blockchain's job is to

448
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,440
resolve the name into a really

449
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,080
contactable uh endpoint sometimes https

450
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
mostly https sometimes something else

451
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,960
and on the second part of my talk I'm

452
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,240
going to talk about how ITP implements

453
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,260
it wrong

454
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,460
so basically all the issue comes all the

455
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,440
issue is caused by the implementer which

456
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,900
is a company called evernam

457
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,059
uh

458
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,880
so you know blockchain is very complex

459
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,100
and when you want to integrate

460
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,320
application that works with a blockchain

461
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,080
there are often trouble for example the

462
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,179
nodes might not always be online because

463
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,120
drop in in blockchain nodes are allowed

464
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,500
to go offline

465
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,260
yeah so so the the no you're you're

466
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,179
trying to contact with might go offline

467
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,500
and you don't know whether it is online

468
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,200
or offline or not and it might also

469
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
takes a long time because you don't know

470
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,240
which node is located where so you

471
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,760
cannot contact the closest node

472
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,340
and this makes

473
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,760
this makes it problematic for use in

474
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,159
client applications uh because the user

475
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,900
might need to wait a long time and fail

476
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,419
and retry so this is very not very ideal

477
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,380
for for fun from a product uh stand of

478
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,580
you and so so what usually happens is

479
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,240
that the the implementer implements a

480
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,360
wrapper uh or in blockchain World

481
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,820
sometimes people say that it is a API

482
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,480
Gateway the Gateway speaks very simple

483
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,100
https or https based uh protocol that uh

484
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,380
that is always online and so the contact

485
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,059
can conduct the Gateway and then perform

486
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,520
the Gateway will perform actions on the

487
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
blockchain uh on behalf of the client

488
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,740
so this is the first problem that every

489
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,020
name creates and the second problem is

490
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,880
that in blockchain users always lose

491
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,480
your private keys and

492
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,760
so the solution comes a very popular

493
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,500
solution for the vendors that let's

494
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,780
manage the user's private key for them

495
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,240
and that defeats all the purpose of the

496
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,159
blockchain actually you probably have

497
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,400
guessed so this is the wrapper the the

498
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,940
the the green box that is used

499
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,480
um by the the Laboratories so evernam

500
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,580
creates a lab app which uh is a

501
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,159
web-based web-based application designed

502
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,580
for laboratory staff to send an issue

503
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,780
and cover test results and it also

504
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,659
manages the the lab's private key on the

505
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,000
blockchain for them

506
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,260
um yeah

507
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,360
and this is what the lab app looks like

508
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
to the right so you can see that on the

509
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,559
interface there is a place for the for

510
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,740
the for the lab staff to uh search for a

511
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,080
task sample ID and to issue a digital

512
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,940
test result and it can also they can

513
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,740
also upload a CAC file for batch

514
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,880
entrance

515
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,659
and and for verification the the

516
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,900
situation is more complex because

517
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,700
uh even though I haven't improviser

518
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,640
Airline app Iota stated that stated to

519
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,380
us that it's not actually used by any

520
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,360
airlines so and and we don't we don't

521
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,640
have the detail on on how the airlines

522
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
are how the verifiers are actually what

523
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,500
programs the verifiers are using to to

524
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,960
verify those digital uh covid-19 test

525
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,039
results

526
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,799
so the actual architecture looks more

527
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,200
like this all the green boxes are

528
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,080
implemented by every name you see

529
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,059
um the user uses ITP which is mostly

530
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,980
implemented by Eminem and the lab also

531
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,679
uses the lab app which is cloud-based

532
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,720
web-based and manage the lab's private

533
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
key and also implemented by Eminem and

534
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,640
to the right the agency service which

535
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,799
hosts the mailbox also implemented by

536
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,100
Eminem to the to the to the bottom right

537
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,980
the the verify app we know from the

538
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,360
statement it also implemented by the by

539
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,500
Evernote so uh and those different

540
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,140
wrappers the the green boxes they talk

541
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,900
to each other on behalf of the user

542
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,299
and they also supposedly will talk to

543
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,220
the blockchain to verify but we don't

544
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,480
really know because we don't have the

545
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,679
implementation

546
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,860
uh I'm not sure if everyone has noticed

547
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,059
the problem here so uh this is a a a a

548
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,419
line from the popular movie Hong Kong

549
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,559
movie uh Charlene soccer uh where you

550
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,080
see on the field in a game when you

551
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
control all the players or the judges or

552
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
the hosts or the co-hosts

553
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,760
there is no way that anyone can beat the

554
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,299
host yeah the game is essentially weaked

555
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,120
so the actual architecture of ITP looks

556
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,620
more more like this

557
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,159
so there's in the central there in in a

558
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,900
in a central there's the the evidence

559
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,640
all in one service that tells everyone

560
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,360
what to do and whether some uh

561
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,260
uh uh covet test results are valid or

562
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,059
invalid so basically they decide

563
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,340
everything they can they can uh the

564
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,419
urban M can issue uh false but looking

565
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,020
real negative test results to any user

566
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,980
and they can also allow passage of inner

567
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,700
authentic covid-19 test results

568
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,799
and the blockchain is also not really

569
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,100
needed here because everyone relies on

570
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,080
every name to talk to the blockchain so

571
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,580
we don't really need it we don't really

572
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,760
need it and if we remove the blockchain

573
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,220
there wouldn't be any any loss of

574
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,140
security of the system because it

575
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,460
already sucks and so let's compare ITP

576
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,279
with the old system

577
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,659
which is paper and in paper uh in in a

578
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,960
paper vaccination verification scheme

579
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,299
you have the lab that issue a

580
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,580
covenanting test results on paper and

581
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
you have the verifiers looking at the

582
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,200
paper to either on visual inspection or

583
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,480
sometimes there are pki based digital

584
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,840
signature algorithms to to verify but at

585
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
least there is the separation of power

586
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,020
that is the verifier and the issuer are

587
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,000
not the same entity

588
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,960
but now we still have the problem that

589
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,539
the results might be forged but worse

590
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,059
because every name controls the issuer

591
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,460
and both the issuer and the verifier so

592
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,799
this is so the essentially what I'm

593
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,000
saying is

594
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,539
the ITP is even less trustworthy than

595
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,620
traditional paper-based uh

596
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,260
vaccine sorry not vaccine covid-19 test

597
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,000
result systems

598
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,580
so there are also other issues with Iota

599
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,279
travel pass for example the live Nets

600
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,500
test is completed entirely client-side

601
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,840
so it can be bypassed

602
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,960
uh as demonstrated in my full project is

603
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,179
bypassed and the digital password

604
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,340
scanning can also be bypassed I can fill

605
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,279
in arbitrary information and ITP will

606
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,020
create a

607
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,480
um digital password for me

608
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,620
and the impact of all those problems

609
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,039
combined is that uh first theoretically

610
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,640
Eminem can create can Forge covid-19

611
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
test results secondly the ITP system is

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,919
even less trustworthy than traditional

613
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,400
paper-based systems and at last

614
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
arbitrary digital passwords can be

615
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,840
created so if people really think that

616
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,880
digital password is a

617
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,179
replacement for physical passports they

618
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,440
will run into big trouble because

619
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,740
digital passwords can be forged

620
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,799
form fortunately too man to to based on

621
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,620
the answers of ayata the digital

622
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,240
password is never really used for

623
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,059
identity verification

624
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,480
so alas why should we care about SSI or

625
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,100
ITP

626
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,860
because

627
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,159
both Canada and the European Union

628
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,659
are currently discussing ways to to

629
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,000
interoperate their existing national ID

630
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
system with

631
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,460
the SSI systems not necessarily

632
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,279
Sovereign but might be other SSI systems

633
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,860
but still I think SSI is very important

634
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,520
because it on a technological level it

635
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,580
is it has some added features compared

636
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,480
to traditional pqi but the all the

637
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,700
problems I laid out was mostly because

638
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,720
of a problematic implementation but not

639
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,480
with the the design of the protocol

640
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,740
itself so so I think so so both the EU

641
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,279
and and Canada are looking to integrate

642
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,440
SSI into their national identity system

643
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,720
so I think this is what makes SSI

644
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,460
important uh yeah for us to look at

645
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,140
and the theoretical advantages of SSI I

646
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,720
think number one would be that users can

647
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,880
finally keep their own data instead of

648
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,100
entrusting them to a identity provider

649
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,960
like Google or Facebook and secondly

650
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,299
there is the peer-to-peer data sharing

651
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,260
so the data sets on the user's control

652
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,120
until the user decides to share them

653
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
yeah and the user can also decide to

654
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,279
selectively disclose information which

655
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,700
is not possible with traditional

656
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,919
TOS or pki based certificates for

657
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,620
example if I get a driver's license uh

658
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,260
that says I'm allowed to drive Auto

659
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,740
vehicles and I have I'm born something

660
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,179
date and I'm a gender or something and

661
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,740
I can use this and construct a zero

662
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,679
knowledge proof that to for example to

663
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,020
someone at a bar to a bartender at a bar

664
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,700
to prove that I'm over 18 and able to

665
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,340
drink I can only I can I can decide to

666
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,840
selectively

667
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
only prove that my age is above 18.

668
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,399
without actually reviewing the the

669
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,940
actual age and also not

670
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,140
revealing any other information such as

671
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,220
my gender yeah and it also allows for

672
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,380
the SSI also allows for decentralized

673
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,779
and private revocation checks because

674
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,360
doing revocation checks the the the the

675
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,299
digital footprint of the check is often

676
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,840
is often also considered a a a kind of

677
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,720
can be inferred uh can can be used to

678
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,200
infer client Behavior but in SSI uh

679
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,080
using zero knowledge proofs we are we

680
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,779
can construct uh decentralized and

681
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,480
private revocation checks

682
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,720
the disadvantages of SSI I think is

683
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,340
mostly on a ecosystem level because

684
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,460
mostly SSI systems are very new now and

685
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,299
most of the SI systems are new so there

686
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,179
is also mostly only just one vendor

687
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,840
behind every SSI system which creates

688
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,640
trust issues because if you decide to

689
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,860
use a system decide to use the SSI

690
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,080
system then you only got one vendor to

691
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,299
choose from and that you will end up the

692
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,340
same as the ITP problem that you have

693
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,340
the same entity that controls the issuer

694
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,279
and the verifier yeah so this often

695
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,740
creates trust issues and the the second

696
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,360
problem is that users always lose their

697
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,880
private keys and I think there are some

698
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,120
uh innovative ways that have been

699
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,179
developed to allow like retrieval of

700
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,940
lost private keys or or or or at least

701
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,539
construct a new trustable one but those

702
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,460
are even more complex which I won't go

703
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,919
into the detail and a last SSI is also

704
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,140
highly highly complex I'm I'm not sure

705
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,940
whether all these complexities are

706
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,000
necessary but because this complexity

707
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,700
will prompt the need to seek vendors

708
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,200
because you cannot implement it yourself

709
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,940
it's too complex

710
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,880
and when you seek vendor you you go back

711
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,980
to the num question number one

712
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,260
um there is only one vendor

713
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,860
so conclusion so Lessons Learned is that

714
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,340
first don't trust the system because

715
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,740
it says is used in blockchain

716
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,919
and secondly don't let the players be

717
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,159
the judge in the system in any system so

718
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,260
we should separate the credential or

719
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,659
certificate issuer and the verifier

720
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,039
entities

721
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,159
so these are the two Lessons Learned and

722
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,039
my opinion is that exercise highly

723
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,080
complex and it is currently in early

724
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
adoption phase and So currently there is

725
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,719
not enough scrutiny on SSI and

726
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,139
implementations so therefore the and

727
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,800
also the a highly complex system also uh

728
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,379
puts a high bar to to implementation and

729
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:25,199
integration which which prompts me as I

730
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,199
said to seek vendors and uh it also

731
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,119
makes it difficult for competing vendors

732
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,820
to to enter the market and which again

733
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,599
might lead to monopolies and this is

734
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,820
Monopoly is definitely not we want to

735
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,719
see in in national ID systems right and

736
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,300
therefore at current stage I would say

737
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,879
that citizens citizens should not trust

738
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,719
SSI for any sort of public use yet maybe

739
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,399
in the future but definitely not now

740
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,280
until more scrutiny and more security

741
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,920
research is done against SSI

742
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,900
and uh but despite all this I think SSI

743
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,200
technology is still promising because it

744
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,920
has it incorporates a lot of the new uh

745
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,140
developments in in mathematics and

746
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,359
cryptographics and so it provides like

747
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,339
all those cute cool new features like

748
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,460
selective disclosure and private

749
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,680
revocation checks so I think these are

750
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,720
very useful and very cool and could help

751
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,820
protect user privacy

752
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,160
and but however uh the we we must

753
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,099
continue to make sure that SSI the SSI

754
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,660
Market remains competitive otherwise

755
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,760
with monopolies we will end up with

756
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,579
worse Solutions than traditional

757
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,000
paper-based systems

758
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,480
and I think so so this is the the second

759
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,820
last slide I will go through very

760
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,160
quickly so first uh you are not really

761
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,500
required to use ITP uh you can still

762
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,700
decide to to have a paper uh

763
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,359
covid-19 test result and also ITP is not

764
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,579
available on every flight it is only

765
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,320
available on select flight so you

766
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,820
probably have not used it that's the

767
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,800
problem that's probably the reason and

768
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,260
can I pass border control with forged

769
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,200
ITP digital Pi squares likely no because

770
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,180
we don't actually know what the border

771
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,099
control is using but I don't think it is

772
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,619
likely that they will use the the ITP

773
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,079
for for that verification so the on the

774
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,579
border control you you probably still

775
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,980
have to show your physical password

776
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,540
and

777
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,940
and third exercise does not require

778
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,940
blockchain you can you can also use pki

779
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,280
blockchain is not required but everyone

780
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,099
uses blockchain

781
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,380
and

782
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,940
so at last

783
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,660
um I did not find any vulnerability on

784
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,180
the political level but rather on a

785
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,300
ecosystem and implementation-wise level

786
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,020
yeah so I.E this is a implementation

787
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,640
issue of SSI

788
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,480
and so that's the end of my talk uh uh

789
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
you can you can look at the the full

790
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,180
report on on this link and you can also

791
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,119
find other cool research from my

792
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,180
colleagues at the

793
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,599
citizenlab.ca and I will be available at

794
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,380
the The Village uh the the cscs booth

795
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,380
you can mostly find me there and there's

796
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,300
my email

797
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,760
uh any questions

798
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,040
true

799
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,480
so anyone who wants to ask questions

800
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,540
um

801
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,660
t

802
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,800
hi

803
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,720
um thanks for the talk

804
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,579
um I guess I have sort of two questions

805
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,640
my first question is how does SSI differ

806
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,220
from just attribute based credentials

807
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,579
generally because so like uh in uh

808
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,280
Anonymous credentials or attribute based

809
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,839
credentials it's just like a pretty well

810
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,660
studied pretty well studied problem in

811
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,900
you know privacy cryptography so for

812
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,760
example the edamix protocol is something

813
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,220
I'm a big fan of that implements uh

814
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,800
attribute based credentials showing that

815
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,380
I have a driver's license for example

816
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,480
that's valid without revealing other

817
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,040
things about me or that I've tested

818
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,140
negative for covid and I'm just

819
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,820
wondering is there a difference between

820
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,339
SSI and this kind of system

821
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,780
um sorry I don't think I've studied

822
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,359
attributed credentials before oh okay I

823
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,920
mean it sounds really similar to what

824
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,960
how you described it maybe it's the same

825
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,300
thing it sounds like very similar but

826
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,859
I'm not really sure

827
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,619
um sorry um by um attribute um

828
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,119
credentials you mean like kind of like

829
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,520
metadata kind of stuff no no it's like

830
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,720
what you were saying so you have a

831
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,280
credential like

832
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,859
um let's say uh I have a my credential

833
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,960
is my University degree so it's issued

834
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,780
to me by some issuer uh like the

835
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,420
university and I have the the degree on

836
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,579
my app for example that has all these

837
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,380
fields and every field in the in the

838
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,180
credential is an attribute so I can for

839
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,540
example say I have a degree in uh

840
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,720
biology and uh and I can verify this

841
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,880
cryptographically kind of like What's

842
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,339
Happening Here

843
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:28,320
who is the signer

844
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,240
the the university would be issuing me

845
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,060
the the credentials on the signer so it

846
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,619
sounds very similar but I have not

847
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,839
studied the term attributed credentials

848
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,000
so I'm not really sure but also one

849
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,280
thing to clarify is that SSI referred to

850
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,220
a to a category of systems and for

851
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,060
example as a sovereign

852
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,700
that can be called SSI and

853
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,060
uh Sovereign is also composed of

854
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,520
different components that that serves

855
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,560
this different purposes in the system

856
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,920
such as the the the attribution

857
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,940
credential that you just mentioned will

858
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,060
probably be you very similar to the the

859
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,060
verifiable credential thing but but not

860
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,400
necessarily with the Aries protocol or

861
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,500
the decentralized identifier component

862
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,960
okay yeah maybe uh we can chat after

863
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,859
because

864
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,920
um there's uh yeah yes it's happy to

865
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,260
chat yeah thanks and do you have a

866
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,060
second question I think uh the second

867
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,380
question was kind of based on the first

868
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,780
okay we can chat about it later okay yes

869
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,119
yeah I guess probably it really depends

870
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,859
on like uh what's the definition for

871
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,020
attribute um credential I think it's

872
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,040
kind of similar to an SSI um aspects um

873
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
from what was previously mentioned yeah

874
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,780
um so

875
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,760
um any more questions

876
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,820
um

877
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,700
um if not maybe I'll I'll ask a question

878
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,780
so

879
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,400
um like right now you're mentioning that

880
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
uh the SSI is not

881
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,140
um kind of mature enough for uh General

882
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,820
applications so let's say there are

883
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,640
developers here um who works on uh

884
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,040
various apps that

885
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,200
um needs to verify the user's identity

886
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,300
so you will still propose that we go the

887
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,700
traditional route of

888
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,320
um

889
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,920
uh directly like verifying oh that's a

890
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,000
that's a good

891
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,020
and difficult to answer question and so

892
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,320
I I I think it is good for

893
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,780
I think that depends on the scale of the

894
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,640
system right so if we're talking about

895
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,680
for example a national ID system like

896
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,140
the Taiwanese Eid system I think we

897
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,820
should definitely not use this exact

898
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
technology for that for now but we

899
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,720
should definitely trial SSI because it

900
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,119
is very promising technology and it

901
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,700
offers many advantages over a

902
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,740
traditional pki-based systems so which

903
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,480
is the one that the Taiwanese ID system

904
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,160
is currently using though we we don't

905
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,420
have Eid yet but yeah this is

906
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,960
implemented with pki right so it's very

907
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,020
interesting and for small scale systems

908
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,440
for example let's say I'm a

909
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,740
um for example I'm I'm a company that I

910
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,339
want to manage my company identity using

911
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,440
SSI I think that that that that that

912
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,839
could be that could be used if you if

913
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,579
SSI could be used in this case because

914
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,180
the it is not public the the company can

915
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,240
rely on a single vendor to to if they

916
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,220
trust the vendor is if you trust the

917
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,040
vendor having all those like cyber

918
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,380
security certifications and and you

919
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,760
trust them I think it should be fine

920
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,339
having the the issue and the verifier

921
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,680
being the same person though it will

922
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,960
still be best if you seek out a

923
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,839
additional vendor uh too so that you you

924
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,579
have two vendors

925
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,680
um scrutinizing over each other yeah

926
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,900
this kind of like democracy you you

927
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,480
shouldn't put the exact excitative

928
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,040
Branch with the of the legislative

929
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,700
branch with the same uh people so that's

930
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,880
going to be problematic uh yeah so

931
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,220
that's basically my answer um so in one

932
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,020
way I mean my understanding of the issue

933
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,599
is like um if you are in a scenario

934
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,359
whereby um the benefits of being like

935
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,780
the leader in um

936
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,060
verifying identities and um

937
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,819
um managing the Privacy issue of that

938
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:22,440
outweighs the possible

939
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,839
um downtime or issues that can come from

940
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,079
using an SSI system then that would be

941
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,660
kind of the opportunity to to use the

942
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,640
system to kind of be the leader in in

943
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,460
that change right

944
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,500
uh yeah I I guess you could say that yes

945
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,380
I think I think it companies could could

946
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,800
could trial that because uh uh I think

947
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,380
the the this this or because I mean

948
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,940
traditionally companies already use

949
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,619
single sign-on systems and that's

950
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,900
already very centralized so if you

951
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,060
replace that with with SSI that is also

952
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,160
essentially centrally controlled that

953
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,560
wouldn't be so bad compared to the to

954
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,319
the to the to the old a single silence

955
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,119
system but it also wouldn't be so good

956
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,420
if you if you can if all everything is

957
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,640
implemented by the same vendor so yeah

958
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
there's okay at one point I'd like to

959
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
add is that

960
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,500
um SSI brings tons of complexity it's

961
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,960
too complex so

962
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,380
um is is the complexity worth the extra

963
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,079
advantages that you have not necessarily

964
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,119
I don't think it is currently true for

965
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,260
most of the case

966
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,020
okay so the takeaway would be um you

967
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,520
know if we have single Scion then

968
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,960
there's something that you can at least

969
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,760
continue to use until we see you know

970
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,960
SSI being um Yeah by some of the leaders

971
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,540
yes yes okay um great um so I think

972
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,000
that's about the time so uh let's thank

973
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,760
um uh paleon with a round of approx for

974
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,160
the uh fantastic speech thank you

975
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,180
I also have a bounty house uh session uh

976
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,960
which will be in Chinese
