1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
yep good excellent my name is fedi

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
chorosky and i'm the founder and ceo of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,040
a company called quorum cyber

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,599
the idea of the talk today was to

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
change it a little bit from what you

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
would normally see in a normal keynote

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
so not going to take anywhere near the

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
full hour the whole premise is to do

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
about 15-20 minutes tops to share a

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
little bit what's

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,439
the journey we experience from coming up

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
with the idea of quorum cyber today six

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,800
years later

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
using that a little bit to dissect

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,840
what a startup feels like in reality

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
including all the nitty-gritty and the

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
bad stuff in the middle

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
so before i jump quick question out of

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
the room how many of you

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
have a dream to either start or be part

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
of a startup at any point in the years

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,559
hands up please

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
okay so about

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
less than a third

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,399
how many of you are already working for

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
a startup from several people

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
i guess right cool look the whole

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
premise of today was

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,319
i think there's a glorified vision of

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
what a startup is and i think it's good

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
to talk about

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
what's in between

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
does that help

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
mike is the better

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
can we hide behind the desk

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,759
no not so good

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,479
still hear me yeah cool

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
there's

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,759
there's a nice quote that i once came

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
across that i liked i think it explains

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,479
a lot of how we feel

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,200
when you are in the startup it's almost

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
like sometimes being in a startup is the

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
collection of mistakes that you make

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
while people think you're succeeding

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
and that story is never really told we

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
only talk about

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
what is in the shiny part in the front

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,799
because that's how allegations happen i

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,240
think it's really healthy that we have a

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
conversation that is much more open

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
about everything that goes in between

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
good about the ugly so that people are

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
better prepared when coming at uni when

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,759
choosing a career path when choosing

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
their next battle what is it that they

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,799
want to do

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,920
so

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,640
what gave birth to us and what gives

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
birth to

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,119
a startup is something i'm always

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
fascinated why do you choose to do this

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,959
why would somebody choose to

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
to go out of a path where you can be

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
developed and there's budgets and

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
there's history and there's colleagues

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
and go do something different

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
and i can only refer to the ones that

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
we've had but talking to other founders

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
has been very interesting to see what

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
motivates different people and there's

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,120
always one or two things that that

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
really matter one is there's usually a

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
technical hypothesis there's something

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
that technically when you're talking

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
about cybersecurity startup triggered

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
you that's something that your your

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
curiosity was triggered by in our case

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,160
we've been doing a bunch of cyber for a

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
while we believed microsoft was doing

81
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
something pretty cool with technology

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
but wasn't yet a cyber security firm

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
right this is back in 2016 we wanted to

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,879
see what we could do hacking together a

85
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
lot of the microsoft tech and see if we

86
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,080
could use them for cyber security

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,959
outcomes

88
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,200
that was the technical hypothesis of

89
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
quorum cyber but then there was a whole

90
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,400
emotional hypothesis of chromosome 2.

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
we particularly i was really

92
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
disenfranchised by the industry i wasn't

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
impressed with what the industry was

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
doing

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
we were selling expensive stuff to

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,760
people i couldn't afford it for problems

97
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,599
they didn't have this was too easy to

98
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
fee or sell in this space it's really

99
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
easy to bully somebody into buying

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
something because at the moment people

101
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
are scared

102
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
right so they're willing to chuck as

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
much investment as they can without

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
really understanding what it is that

105
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
they're trying to achieve with it simply

106
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
because it's a huge problem they need to

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,360
do something about it

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
so combined the technical idea that we

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
could do something with really cool tech

110
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
and we were a little bit pissed off with

111
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
the industry that's what gave birth to

112
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
core that's what gave us the motivation

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
to go and do something

114
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
so how did it feel to start well it was

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,599
actually

116
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,440
the easiest part of the journey getting

117
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,519
started it was we we had a couple of

118
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,879
billable engagements we were doing

119
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,239
contracts everybody was working already

120
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
was billing so money was coming in

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,799
through the door which is usually one of

122
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
the big challenges of startup and the

123
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
first couple of years we're figuring out

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
what we wanted to do we had ideas about

125
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
what to do but we didn't really know

126
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
what would stick in the market so we

127
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
started doing pen testing because we

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
were good at that that's historically

129
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
what we're doing we did some consulting

130
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,400
around the security architecture because

131
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
we're doing it actually wasn't too hard

132
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
our dream was to build a managed service

133
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
offering in a microsoft universe so what

134
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
we needed to do was have a day job while

135
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
we were trying to build that in the

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
background trying to hack those

137
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
technologies away that actually was the

138
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
simple part it's the part in the middle

139
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
that i think

140
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,759
i really wanted to spend some time and

141
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,960
the idea would be i'm going to talk a

142
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
little bit about this next to a couple

143
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
of slides and then what i want is some

144
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
questions okay if people will take five

145
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
questions depending on how time goes i

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,479
really want us to be more of a

147
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
conversation not just me talking at you

148
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
for half an hour right

149
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
so

150
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
once we got started this is when the

151
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
collection of

152
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
errors start to happen right and this is

153
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
totally normal this is this is how it

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
feels like the problem is 90 of startups

155
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
fail at here

156
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
so if you get filtered in your big

157
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
extinction event of which you will have

158
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
many over the first couple of years

159
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
that's it that's the end of the road and

160
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
that's what most startups happen we're

161
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
now five years in we're a hundred people

162
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
strong and growing aggressively we are

163
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
quintupling our managed service revenue

164
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
permanently into that man over there in

165
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
the middle uh every year and year it's

166
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
insane right so we are thankfully

167
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,639
through kind of some of the first early

168
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
extinction level events of a startup but

169
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
we faced many of them

170
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
and

171
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
i can't stress enough what it feels like

172
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
to be facing one of them it's a bullet

173
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
train running through your stomach

174
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
because everything you work for for the

175
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
last couple of years and the people that

176
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
trusted you in that journey are all

177
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
affected by that

178
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
so what was our worst one

179
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,639
and and our worst one was a moment

180
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,160
and year probably three of the startup

181
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,080
and the moment was

182
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
the result of a collection of things

183
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
that happened before right so a moment

184
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,479
doesn't just materialize so it's a

185
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
collection of pairs that got us there

186
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
what happened and how i'll describe this

187
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
the worst day of my professional career

188
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,800
ever in the 28 something years i've been

189
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
doing this this was the worst day it was

190
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
a day that we had to sit down with one

191
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
or two people

192
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
from the mart from the board

193
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
and we looked at the numbers and we were

194
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
succeeding right we were growing we were

195
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
selling

196
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
but we were running out of money all the

197
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
time and we couldn't understand why how

198
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,360
can it be that we're winning business

199
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
like never before

200
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,319
we're bringing in new customers we're

201
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,000
bringing in ready revenue

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
but we're always out of money and we

203
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
weren't recruiting a hundred thousand

204
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,319
people so it wasn't that we were

205
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
spending all that money immediately

206
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
something here is fundamentally broken

207
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,400
and it wasn't until we dissected the

208
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
numbers and we dissected everything that

209
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
had happened that we realized that there

210
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
were two primary mistakes

211
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
one

212
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
the numbers were in right

213
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
and they weren't right because

214
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
incompetence and they weren't right

215
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
because of maliciousness

216
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
and that's something that when you

217
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,080
discover that somebody from the team

218
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
some of us were a bit stupid and some of

219
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,680
us were a bit nefarious

220
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
it is an

221
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
it is an unexplainable feeling because

222
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
you feel violated to a certain degree in

223
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
a startup in a team of 10 and 2015

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
everybody has to pull their weight right

225
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
you don't have the luxury of checks and

226
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
balances that you can put in a big

227
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
organization

228
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
and by the time you figure out that

229
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
something's not working well it can be

230
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
too late

231
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,479
and we were this close i remember being

232
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
in our really tiny shitty office and and

233
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,039
princeton street and edinburgh

234
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,240
looking at

235
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,639
what do i need to do who do i keep in

236
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,919
the business in order to keep this

237
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,199
running tomorrow

238
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,720
so it's not a question of well we might

239
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,080
need to get rid of one person or two to

240
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,680
save clustered we might need to go for

241
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
some money to keep this light on because

242
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
i can get through the hole and then this

243
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
is sustainable this as we've been

244
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
running it is unsustainable we didn't

245
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
know

246
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
because we've been cutting deals at

247
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,639
prices that were

248
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,240
unaffordable by paying commissions for

249
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
the full value of the deal we were

250
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,599
registering deals that weren't happening

251
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,879
it was an absolute schedule it was a

252
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
disaster right so this is not something

253
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
i can fix in 24 hours and get through

254
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,840
the hole so we had to sit down and look

255
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
at a roster of the entire team and say

256
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
who do we keep i cannot explain to you

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
the feeling of of that evening it was

258
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
absolutely horrendous

259
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
thankfully that wasn't required and we

260
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,120
were able to

261
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
do some magic and raise a little bit of

262
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
money and extend some faith in our

263
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
customers and ask for customers to to

264
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,800
bear with us well we recovered that and

265
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
we were able to continue without

266
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
removing more than just one person who

267
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,919
was part of the guilty party that led to

268
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,759
that situation to begin with so what

269
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
what happened there what failed yes

270
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
there were control failures there were

271
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,719
processes that could have been in place

272
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
should have been in place arguably that

273
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
in order to prevent this from happening

274
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,039
there's one thing that was fundamentally

275
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,719
wrong we forgot for one second that no

276
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,600
matter what your field is no matter the

277
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
fact that we're a cyber security tech

278
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
company this is about people

279
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
and if you don't get the people bid

280
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
right you don't have a business the

281
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
people bit is absolutely fundamental we

282
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
just happen to use tools to do an

283
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
outcome but people is all we have is all

284
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
we are we are a people company and that

285
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,279
team and how that team behaves and how

286
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
you assign responsibilities and how you

287
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
check on each other is absolutely

288
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
fundamental that is the one thing that

289
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,080
connects both the successes and the

290
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
failures of everything that we can do in

291
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
a startup it is the people that you

292
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
choose it is the people you work with

293
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
so we make many mistakes this was

294
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,519
probably the worst one a collection of

295
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
mistakes that led to the worst day of my

296
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
career but what did we get right

297
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
in order to do that

298
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,560
and we also got right to people

299
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
but what to get rid of other people what

300
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
we got right was how and why we chose to

301
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
be in this team

302
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,640
it's why we chose to spend part of our

303
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
career in this particular company in

304
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
this particular tiny company that was

305
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
starting to grow as opposed to something

306
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,120
else

307
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
we connected to something that we

308
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
actually believe was important we

309
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
connected to something we believed and

310
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
we knew was real we didn't just decide

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
to take a job in cyber we decided to

312
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
actually pick up a battle that we

313
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,399
believed in in this case in our case the

314
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
battle cry as we fight bullies because

315
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
we believe

316
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
that the tools and skills that we have

317
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
can be used for good and not just for

318
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
the source of revenue or for actually

319
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,839
just to grow a company there's a there's

320
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
a reason that we can put together our

321
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,839
combined strengths and combine skills

322
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,360
and we choose to do that in order to

323
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
defend customers that are being attacked

324
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
by threat actors that simply they

325
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
they're over matched the disparity of

326
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
power in this conversation is completely

327
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
one-sided and most organizations can

328
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
they're completely overpowered so what

329
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
we choose to do was build a company

330
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
around an idea and that idea became the

331
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
fundamental driving force of quorum

332
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
cyber and that's why today we have a

333
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
team of people that actually can see

334
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
through the challenges that we see at

335
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
the start

336
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
this is what made us win

337
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,800
it wasn't the tech the tech is amazing

338
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,399
we did great things with the tech it

339
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
wasn't the processes it wasn't the

340
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,320
certainly not the compensation sorry

341
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,120
team

342
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,000
it it is it is the idea that bonded us

343
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
together to try to do something a little

344
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
bit different

345
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,839
and that's

346
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
what if anybody here is looking to start

347
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
a startup if anybody's here looking to

348
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
join a startup

349
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,640
join the business join the team that has

350
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
an idea that you can believe in an idea

351
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
that you want to buy because if you do

352
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,640
that even the bad days are easy because

353
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,000
you have a team around you people you

354
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
can lean on and that's the one thing

355
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,079
that people bring to the table the

356
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,519
ability to lean on each other the

357
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
ability on the worst of your days when

358
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
the world is burning you're super busy

359
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
everything is on fire you look around

360
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
and you say who can i help to get their

361
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,920
job done who can i help to get them out

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
of the holder they're in and if

363
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,360
everybody in the teams behaves the right

364
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
way behaves that way then you have a

365
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,519
winning team and that's a team worth

366
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,839
being in

367
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
this is really my focus of the talk i

368
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
don't i didn't want to go beyond this

369
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
because i think the world right now is

370
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,519
and i i must admit standing here today

371
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,120
was really difficult for me because

372
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
everything that's going on in the world

373
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
didn't set up for for me to to have a

374
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
clear mind to talk and i don't want to

375
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
borrow anybody else's grief but we live

376
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
in a world that has a big bully

377
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
right now and it's really difficult to

378
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
stand here and talk about successful

379
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,839
startup and pretend to ignore that

380
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,600
situation in the world right now so

381
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
apologies if it's a bit more

382
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
unstructured than a normal keynote all i

383
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
wanted to do was talk a little bit about

384
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
what we can do here

385
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,800
to try to have better fights and to try

386
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
to fight epic battles to help people win

387
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,120
the skills that you dominate are unique

388
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
and we can apply them from pretty

389
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
powerful and good stuff so whether it's

390
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
in quorum or in a dharma or when it's

391
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
f-secure or any other companies that are

392
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
out there join something that you

393
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,360
believe in and try to put those good

394
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
skills to use find your bullies thank

395
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
you very much

396
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,920
so

397
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
ideally questions we have time and then

398
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
five i'll take five questions and then

399
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
you can liberate for coffee and go talk

400
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
to the standard to the sponsor at the

401
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
bottom we have any questions

402
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
at the very back very comfortable just

403
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,639
shout it out

404
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
yeah super super good question so for

405
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
hopefully you've heard it i've noticed

406
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
how do you attract and how do you retain

407
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
people in a heated market like today

408
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839
if you have the answer to that

409
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
i'd love to hear so something we did

410
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
very early on was we brought in a chief

411
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
people officer so when we were about 15

412
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,160
people we knew that this was going to be

413
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
an essential part of the conversation

414
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
how do we grow the team so we brought in

415
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
a cheap people off so this is a guy that

416
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
i've known for years that has grown and

417
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,399
built teams for some of the biggest

418
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,920
companies out there so i wanted somebody

419
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
really minding this even before that the

420
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
first person i brought to the team and

421
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
he's here you go to the stand you look

422
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
at a fella that's about 170 years old

423
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
it's called bill thompson he was a

424
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,279
recruiter and so the first person in the

425
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
company was somebody who's dedicated

426
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
helping me find the people so we knew

427
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
that people was the key here right so we

428
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
did some things right at the very

429
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
beginning but as we grew this became

430
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
even more complicated so you can always

431
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,360
convince the first couple of fools to

432
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
follow you so the first two or three

433
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,519
people

434
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
some weird idealist somewhere that you

435
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,880
can convince to follow you that's easy

436
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
it's what happens after that that gets

437
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
tricky

438
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
what i believe

439
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
makes you an attractive

440
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,360
company an attractive team and then

441
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,959
not just attractive for you to come in

442
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
but to stay is developing

443
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,519
what when we talk to people the thing

444
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,480
that everybody tells us that they want

445
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,639
to leave a team for is not pay

446
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,519
yes

447
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,959
at the moment it's really easy to get a

448
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,720
better salary right so you don't need to

449
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,160
be even good you just need to be here

450
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,000
and have a pulse and in cyber security

451
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,519
you're gonna get paid a fortune right so

452
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
great news for everybody in this room

453
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
there's absolutely no lack of junk

454
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
security for you guys you're all right

455
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
and in any team no matter what team

456
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
you're in if you put your cpa in

457
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,639
linkedin right now and you're probably

458
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,160
all getting brute force anyway by

459
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
recruiters every day you can get a job

460
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,880
within five seconds it's gonna be

461
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
another 20 30k right this is the reality

462
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,279
of the market so pay

463
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
is not just the reason because people

464
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
still stay in places what we found is

465
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,160
actually the lack of development is the

466
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
key factor where people choose to leave

467
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,959
they brought me in they told me that i

468
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,160
was going to be developed two years in

469
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,519
i'm still doing tickets and i've learned

470
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
nothing now there's two problems there

471
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,560
first of all sometimes you're getting

472
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,839
developed you don't even know it and

473
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,279
that's something we need to admit on the

474
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
job development is one of the key parts

475
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,519
of the development so there's a little

476
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,800
bit of you need to talk about

477
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
development

478
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,120
in order for people to know they're

479
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
being developed that sounds

480
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,279
counter-intuitive but you do need to

481
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
really talk about it very explicitly

482
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,639
because even if you think you're not you

483
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
probably are it's just the company has a

484
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
structure in a way to tell that story

485
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,279
we

486
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,279
have been terrible at this

487
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
in our growth we've sacrificed the

488
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
attention to develop our people in all

489
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
the ways we wanted to because we were

490
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,079
super busy so we took some major steps

491
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
literally this year we created what we

492
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
call quorum cyber academy

493
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
which is our internal department idea of

494
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
how do we train and develop our people

495
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,959
we have guilds so for every specialism

496
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
of things that we do we have a guild

497
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
master and that field master determines

498
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,160
the training path for people that

499
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
subscribe to that guild so you can be in

500
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,639
the salt being an analyst but you want

501
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
to subscribe to the pen testing guild

502
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
great so you'll do your job and then

503
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
you'll have your guild master that will

504
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
tell you how you can progress your

505
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
skills in that path we have an

506
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,000
apprenticeship program for people that

507
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,920
are coming out of uni where you can do

508
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
two years of rotations to the different

509
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
departments in quorum servers so you can

510
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
experience every single team before you

511
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
choose your specialism we have solutions

512
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
directors people that are kind of black

513
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
cat speakers super

514
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
famous

515
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
25 years experience in the field who are

516
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
there to run those academies so that you

517
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
have a magnet of people to learn so

518
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
i'm not just trying to pitch

519
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
requirements my point is

520
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
development is i think the key to how

521
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
you choose to attract and retain but you

522
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,279
need to deliver you can't just talk

523
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,040
about it has to be real and this is

524
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,959
where we as as much as everybody else

525
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,720
has failed in keeping that promise all

526
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
the time so we're trying to get better

527
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,279
we're trying to actually honor the

528
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
promises that we make and keep them it

529
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,839
ain't easy though

530
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
um i guess one of the things i'm curious

531
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,599
about someone say as you start really

532
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,959
small and you grow

533
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,760
and

534
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,119
i guess at the beginning you kind of

535
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,919
want to accept all the work

536
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,439
how do you kind of balance that with

537
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,439
like how much step you're actually ready

538
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,600
to deliver

539
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,079
so the question is how do you just again

540
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,360
the microphone for the recording uh the

541
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
question is how do you cope with the

542
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
balance of not saying yes to everything

543
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,320
because you see the money there and you

544
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
want to kind of get every stream of

545
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,280
revenue and every pun coming into the

546
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
door with

547
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
i guess your skill to deliver good

548
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
quality work and actually just not not

549
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
burying out right and keeping focus

550
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
the answer is super tricky right so and

551
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
there's different paths i think you can

552
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
make trade-offs if you're unfunded as i

553
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
was at the beginning but i had an

554
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,240
ability to

555
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,919
uh borrow money so i had i had the

556
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
ability to borrow debt as a company

557
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
which is not something i already can do

558
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
you have a couple of more options right

559
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
if you have no funding at all you you

560
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,799
you earn what and you eat what you earn

561
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,080
and that's it that's the only thing then

562
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
you'd be probably forced to do different

563
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,480
choices

564
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,720
so what we did was at the beginning

565
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
everybody was a billable asset myself

566
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
and everybody that came in through the

567
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
door except bill was a billable asset we

568
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
were all consulting right we were taking

569
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
contracts we were doing our work

570
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,640
consulting or in some response or pen

571
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
testing whatever right and some of the

572
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
contents were quite long so we were

573
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
embedded in customers helping them drive

574
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
security programs for them so that

575
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,919
brought money in through the door making

576
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,280
us really profitable from day one that

577
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
was great but over the first couple of

578
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
years as we had the two or three

579
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,799
products we wanted to build we did about

580
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
20 to 25 other things that were just

581
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
coming into the door as you say right so

582
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,039
great engagement in cyber security we

583
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
can definitely deliver it okay come in

584
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
so we were doing cyber essentials so

585
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
it's to mark's demise somewhere in the

586
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,240
room for example not the finest of

587
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
engagements but you know what there's

588
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,799
good money coming in new relations with

589
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,080
new customers so

590
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,679
you make a trade-off is your new

591
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,919
customer more important to you than just

592
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
doing pen testing because you want to

593
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
build relationships with new customers

594
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
and you want to figure out what part of

595
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
your portfolio you want to work you can

596
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
do that if you have funding

597
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
that

598
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,679
that divorces you from the need to say

599
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
yes to everything so for the first three

600
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
years for example we were doing this

601
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
hand to mouth pretty much with a bit of

602
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,480
debt in background at the end of year

603
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
three i drove an investment deal so i

604
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,440
went to a vc firm bill maven and i took

605
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
an investment that saw me put in two

606
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
million pounds of the growth capital

607
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
into the firm at that point i put out my

608
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,039
board and i used the two millions to

609
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,200
grow once you have a war chest and you

610
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
can start hiring a head you can be much

611
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
more strategic as to what type of work

612
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,480
you want to do

613
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
18 months after that first investment

614
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
that was june 2020 eight that would be

615
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
our 25 people we

616
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,039
revenue 2.7 million and i drove a 3

617
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,559
million pound investments but a million

618
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,240
of that was to restructure the company 2

619
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
million without about two to to inject

620
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,039
into growth 18 months after that we were

621
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,600
over a hundred people and we were

622
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
we've had seven times the revenue we had

623
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
18 months before

624
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,360
so a war chest can actually be a really

625
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,559
good way to fund your early years

626
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,720
without wasting time wasting time you

627
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
know what i mean without distracting

628
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
your attention from things that are

629
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
needed but not necessarily strategic to

630
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,559
where you want to go and that's

631
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,919
something that edinburgh has a lot

632
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,200
nobody's asking about funding yet which

633
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
is interesting whenever i have one of

634
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
these conversations people ask about

635
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
funding

636
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
edinburgh or scotland in general

637
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
edinburgh gospel i think in particular

638
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
are particularly really good at early

639
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
stage funding

640
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,080
scotland is not great at later stage

641
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,679
funding right so if you want to get 20

642
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
30 40 million to your company i think

643
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,799
it's a lot more challenging but the

644
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
beginning stages of investment if you

645
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
have an idea if you want to do something

646
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
actually there's a ton of vcp firms and

647
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
different schemas that you can apply in

648
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
the government to help you fund those

649
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
early years so my advice would be if

650
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
you're wanting to go down this route try

651
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,000
to get access to some of that money

652
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
because that can actually shortcut a lot

653
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
of the time where you're having to take

654
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
engagements you might not want to do

655
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
simply to pay the lights it's a lot more

656
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
money than people think and i know it

657
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
sounds super scary to jump into that

658
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
pool because you feel you're like a

659
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,159
goldfish surrounded by sharks at least

660
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,840
certainly that's how i felt

661
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
you can get a lot of really good

662
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
stewardship in scotland scotland is a

663
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
nice community for startups we help each

664
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,679
other there's a lot of forums where

665
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,039
people will direct you there's good

666
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,480
advisors there's people that can connect

667
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,760
you with the right investor behind the

668
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
scenes we are absolutely universally

669
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
unique scotland is perfect for early

670
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,000
startups so if this is something you're

671
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,360
interested in this is the best place you

672
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,639
can hope to start a business in

673
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,640
hopefully that makes some sense

674
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,919
two more questions

675
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
oh here one did you have any trouble

676
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
certainly i still do every day to be

677
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,360
honest so that problem doesn't go away

678
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
it's just a bigger customer that now

679
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
distrusts you uh thankfully i've been

680
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
around for a while so so i federico was

681
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
known i had a network had customers

682
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
before i had a startup before

683
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
i used to be part of what became a

684
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
dharma

685
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
ages ago so so i've been i've been

686
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
around this place when we were building

687
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,960
vacta and dc security that became a

688
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
camera that made my life a lot easier i

689
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,240
wasn't coming into a completely bare

690
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,799
pipeline if you want i also started with

691
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
a sister company who had all their

692
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,919
customers they just weren't doing

693
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,360
security they were doing a t so i had

694
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,640
access to a relatively uh friendly

695
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,559
customer base there that i could go over

696
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,080
satellite services beyond what they were

697
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
normally doing so i was absolutely

698
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
privileged in how i started however that

699
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
challenge exists every time i now talk

700
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
to companies or 30 40 000 seats trying

701
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
to buy our soak and they say oh but you

702
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
only have 100 people so well dude if you

703
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
want a hundred thousand humans for your

704
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
contract go to whipper but they will

705
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
chuck humans at it you want to come

706
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,880
somebody that does good engineering

707
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
automation and really smart guys yeah

708
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
okay that's us

709
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,080
you're always going to be too small for

710
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
someone or too unknown for someone and

711
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,960
they're going to be

712
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
preparing to buy the safe option that's

713
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
always going to happen

714
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
what i've learned over the years is

715
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
the quicker you identify what a good

716
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
customer looks like for you the easier

717
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
life begins because you start stop

718
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
focusing on all the money you start

719
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
focusing on the one that agrees with

720
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,679
your other customers that think how you

721
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,120
think the customers that believe what

722
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
you believe in and that's a privilege

723
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
right when you get to get to the point

724
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
of what we call money where it's

725
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
just busy i'm not gonna i'm gonna walk

726
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,039
away from this opportunity because

727
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,480
that's wrong it's gonna consume all my

728
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
time and attention there's 10 other

729
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
customers over here that are better

730
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
served by us

731
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
that's that's the day you win right

732
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
that's the day that you you hope to get

733
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
to and it took us about four years to

734
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,159
get there as a business at the beginning

735
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,440
you might not have that luxury you need

736
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
to work on it so

737
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,760
but

738
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
so i wouldn't stress too much because

739
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,039
there's always somebody that's going to

740
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,400
distrust in that case just move along

741
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
you're not here

742
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
i would advise there's enough people

743
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,039
that need help and are willing to

744
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
partner with a newcomer that they know

745
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
is going to be hungry that they're not

746
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,440
it's going to bend over backwards to

747
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,039
give a good service

748
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
you can trade off on look we'll charge

749
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
you less but i need a case study because

750
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
i'm trying to build my brand on my

751
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
reputation and your brand and reputation

752
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
is everything you're banking on it

753
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
doesn't matter when you are doing it i

754
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
still depend every single engagement

755
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,760
every single day we shop to work we can

756
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
undo the five six seven years of growth

757
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
we've had if we do one wrong thing so

758
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
and we drill this on the team all the

759
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
time the ethos of how you behave is

760
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
absolutely essential at the beginning as

761
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,400
much as in the middle of the end it

762
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
doesn't matter you live and die by your

763
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,120
reputation so get the one the first of

764
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
the two going and then that reputation

765
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,559
becomes your biggest weapon here code

766
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,840
talk to my customer and try to deliver

767
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,520
this work but there's always going to be

768
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,559
somebody that doesn't trust you because

769
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,240
you're too small continuing

770
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
to argentinian

771
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,880
there's always a reason

772
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,919
i'm not sure if it was a good answer

773
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
last question

774
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,719
[Music]

775
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,840
great question

776
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,679
i think

777
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,279
this is the advice that i would give

778
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
everybody don't just do the startup

779
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
because the startup feels like a good

780
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
idea try to connect with something

781
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,799
deeper for you right so when we started

782
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,360
quorum cyber when i started purpose

783
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,600
the motto the the warcraft was do the

784
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
right thing right that was that was

785
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
fundamentally i wanted

786
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
i believe that's super idealistic right

787
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
so apologies a bit error but i believe

788
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
that a whole bunch of us were feeling

789
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,279
anxious because we had nowhere to pour

790
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
our energies into there's nothing we

791
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
could believe in to pull all the energy

792
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
we had bundling up into something that

793
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
we just wanted to to really pursue right

794
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,880
i think that's why religions used to

795
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
work because they gave you a course and

796
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,799
we could put all our attention all our

797
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,520
emotion all our passion into a cause

798
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
that was articulated for us that's one

799
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
of the things religious in the modern

800
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,799
world where people are believing in

801
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,000
those things

802
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
we are not we don't have that experience

803
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
there's not a single cause in the

804
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
workforce usually that you can pour all

805
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,080
that passion into

806
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
when things really changed for us was

807
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
when we were able to really articulate

808
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,919
our message our work right and at that

809
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,120
point

810
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,279
it became so much more clear lifted the

811
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,919
fog as to why are we doing this sure

812
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,840
financial success is a necessity that's

813
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
the oxygen of the company but that's not

814
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
why you do it there's other ways to do

815
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
money much easier once than doing a

816
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,520
startup so it can that's a necessity

817
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
that you need in order to exist but

818
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,520
that's not the reason why finding our

819
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,000
why was probably the most powerful way

820
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
to actually succeed what we were trying

821
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,480
to do

822
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
and this why came from personal

823
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
experience

824
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
so when i was growing up in engineering

825
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
born and bred in argentina i was fat

826
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,400
short

827
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
didn't like football preferred climbing

828
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
and ufos and i was a vegetarian i was

829
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
bullied to

830
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
right i was bullied my entire childhood

831
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,520
i was a deeply unhappy social child i

832
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
just couldn't find my place

833
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
in a serendipitous way

834
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,400
as i said before the skills that i

835
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
developed through those dark years

836
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
became useful in a world where i can now

837
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
use them to help somebody not go through

838
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,080
that and instead of not going through

839
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
that at school i get to do it in

840
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
business

841
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
right so i get to be the grown up

842
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,600
defending organizations that are being

843
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,679
bullied and when we were able to connect

844
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,679
those personal experiences of who we

845
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,559
were before to what we wanted to do as a

846
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,880
business completely changed for us so

847
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
best advice would be

848
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
meditate on this before you start

849
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
because this is how you win

850
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,760
it's not just having a great technology

851
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,279
it's actually having a mission that you

852
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,240
and the people around you and your

853
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,720
customers can believe

854
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,960
a lot guys i'll see you around
