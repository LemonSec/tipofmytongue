1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,600
um so i'm going to be talking about uh

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
exploration

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,559
okay i'm going to talk about an

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,599
exploration into qr codes and using them

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
as like an unexpected phishing vector

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,640
uh so first of all

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
who am i i'm fourth year ethical hacker

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
uh link in the links a bit and i'm

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
currently doing my botnet on disrupting

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
the myrie botnet though i'm doing my

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,519
dissertation on disrupting my report

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
there um

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
so

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
first of all we all know what qr codes

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,680
are right they're little annoying

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
squares that you scan with your phone

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
uh qr stands for quick response codes

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,960
and they were invented in 1994 by

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
denzel wave to help with manufacturing

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
um

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,000
so

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
so it works

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
basically doesn't matter it contains a

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
few positioning squares

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
and a bunch of data and it's also got

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
some complicated error correction

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,120
methods so you can technically like

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
cover half of the qr code and it still

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
works

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
most of the time they're used

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
like the simplest form they store data

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
they can sort bytes or bits they can

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
store numeric or alphanumeric data and

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,680
we can also store kanji

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
which usually just gets used to store

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
urls to point to

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,119
some website

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,159
um

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,439
so you've got

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
i've got a few examples basically so

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,720
you've got parking you've got test and

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
protect i'm sure we've all been scanning

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,520
a bunch of the past few years

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
there's been a few people on twitter

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
posting

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
qr codes as links to

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
torrent sites

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
amazon uses qr codes to package tracking

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
and there was the big famous

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
um

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,640
recent

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,439
ad at the super bowl by coinbase with

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,640
just a single qr code bouncing around

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
so what are the malicious uses of a qr

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
code so storing it as data probably

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
isn't going to be very useful but as a

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,159
ur url

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,600
that someone can scan on their phone and

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
get taken to a malicious website

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
that could be potentially really useful

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
because it lets you place

62
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
urls in the real world where people

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
aren't expecting to get attacked by

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
fishing links

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
so the generic malicious urls that you

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,680
have

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
pretty well studied you have a

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
reflective cross-site scripting attack

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
you could have a clone of the real site

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
that someone accesses and enters their

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
data and then you get all their data you

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
should have a beef server running and

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
you can steal a bunch of their browser

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
details using that

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,360
or you could run some malicious

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
javascript when they open the webpage

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
which should let you

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
install things or

79
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
mess with their stuff basically

80
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,239
so

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
why would you use

82
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
a qr code versus a hyperlink it wasn't

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
going really fast sorry

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
um

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,599
so qr codes are pretty unreadable

86
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
like

87
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
you can technically do it

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
but you're not going to be able to do it

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
in like any meaningful time and most

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
people are getting relatively good at

91
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
looking at a url

92
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
and deciding that it looks a bit sus

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
and it's like a really long string and

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,440
you're like nah i'm not going to click

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
on that

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
but with qr codes especially with like

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
test and protect and all this track and

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
trace stuff everyone just kind of

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
sees them and just scans them because

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
that's what you do with the qr code

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
and so

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
like you could very easily just place qr

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
codes in places that people are already

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
expecting them and they're not going to

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
think twice about just

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
scanning a qr code

107
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
um

108
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
on top of that there's quite there's a

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,920
lot of apps to scan qr codes but some of

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,440
them are kind of a bit um

111
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
so you've got google lens itself which

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is pretty good because it like

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,319
tells you the entire url

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,480
and you've got you've got some that

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,519
you've got this one here that gives you

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
a little disclaimer that goes ooh

117
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,200
it may be a dangerous link don't click

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,959
it if you don't if you don't trust it

119
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
but like that's not going to do anything

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
uh you've got the one the far end

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
doesn't even tell you the full url it

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,640
just tells you the domain

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,799
and so the rest of it could contain a

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
bunch of cross-state scripting

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
and you can't do anything about that

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
and the other one is

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
a screenshot from

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
uh

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
google the play store and there's a

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
trispersky has their own url scanning

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
app that they claim will protect you

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
against dangerous links

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,720
uh all i found was it immediately opened

134
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
the link without even letting you look

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,240
at it

136
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
so you just held your phone up and it

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
immediately opened without even like

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
doing anything which was a bit scary

139
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
so

140
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
how can you bring url's malicious stuff

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
and qr codes together

142
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
so

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
you could have a malicious actor who

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
would mirror

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
a restaurant's web app like lots of

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
restaurants are starting to have web

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
apps like nando's you can order online

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
you scan all qr code on the table

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
and then if you start replacing a couple

150
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
of the qr codes

151
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
in the restaurant with your malicious

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,479
versions

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
and then

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,759
you could start skimming money

155
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
off of the transactions the transactions

156
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
would still go through to nando's

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
nando's would still give them their food

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
and the only thing that we'd notice is

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
the difference

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,759
is that it costs a couple quid more and

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,360
then actually pocketing like two quid

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
off of every transaction

163
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
and across the entirety of the uk

164
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
potentially like

165
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
china's scary how much you could make

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
basically

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
that one's kind of fun

168
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
so you wouldn't scan a qr code right

169
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
well

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
in pennsylvania there's this university

171
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,720
they did an experiment and they placed a

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
bunch of qr codes all over the town of

173
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,240
the city

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,919
about 61 of those flyers got scanned

175
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,360
with about 225 hits can't really read it

176
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
but something like sixty percent

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
of the qr codes that got scanned like a

178
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
like youtube survey and sixty percent of

179
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
the responses just said that they did it

180
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
because they were curious

181
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,280
not because they actually wanted any

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
more information they were just like oh

183
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
what's this and like

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,520
14 said that they did it for fun

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,400
um

186
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
and the next experiment they did is they

187
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
had a bulletin board that they put a

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
little surveillance camera next to this

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
bizarre car

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
um

191
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,759
but

192
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
they tracked people who like walked up

193
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
and scanned the qr code but then didn't

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
follow the link and they found that of

195
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
the 18 people in the one week period

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
that they saw scanning the qr code

197
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
only three of them didn't follow the

198
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,919
link

199
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
so

200
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
yeah i had like 15 people reading the

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
link and deciding that

202
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,160
it was safe enough to follow and go look

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
at whatever random things there are

204
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
um

205
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
so people do seem to scan qr codes and

206
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
on top of that like

207
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
there's the when you expect one to be

208
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
there

209
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
it's much easier to just

210
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
assume that it's safe if you expect

211
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
there to be a qr code

212
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
like in a restaurant to scan for their

213
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
menu just gonna do it and you're not

214
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
gonna think twice about that right

215
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,039
so

216
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
you wouldn't scan a qr code

217
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,680
so you may have noticed there's a few qr

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
codes all over the

219
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
the conference center today

220
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
or the union i guess and you guys are

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,160
actually pretty good so you only

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
i only got

223
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
10 people scanning them or nine people

224
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,199
scanning them

225
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,479
which was pretty good

226
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,599
um

227
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,039
and i had all these red dots and

228
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
locations around the net

229
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
i had them positioned uh but i had two

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,199
that looked like the test and protect uh

231
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,400
like little

232
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,160
kyle's should have had a full student um

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
and both of those got scanned two times

234
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
on one of them three times on the other

235
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
and that was in

236
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,840
half a day if that

237
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
and the actual test and protect site has

238
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
you entering details

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
so you can start scraping like people's

240
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,599
information relatively easily i also had

241
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,599
three relatively innocuous ones they're

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,319
just the qr code and a security logo and

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
all those ones got scanned like four

244
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
times or something i think

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
um so yeah people like even like you lot

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
like security professionals

247
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
just scan them for fun because you're

248
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
curious as to what it is

249
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
so

250
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,839
what do we do to protect yourselves

251
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
against like the potential for malicious

252
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,000
qr codes

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
that are gonna they're gonna steal your

254
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,320


255
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
so as a user if you keep your devices up

256
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
to date any malicious web app that you

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,399
access

258
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
it's probably not going to be that

259
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
consequential

260
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
don't just go around scanning all of

261
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
them as they say curious to kill the cat

262
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
so

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
if it looks a bit suspicious

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
you don't really need to know like it's

265
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
a random qr code in the middle of

266
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
nowhere

267
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
you don't need to scan everything

268
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
if you can do things physically

269
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
it's gonna just be better the majority

270
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
of the time because you don't have to

271
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,040
deal with accessing the weird online

272
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
world

273
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
and on top of that https is not enough

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
it just encrypts your data and it's

275
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
relatively easy for malicious websites

276
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
to get

277
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
uh https certification

278
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
so

279
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,120
there's like not much that stops a

280
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
hacker who has

281
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
a certified like who has a certificate

282
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
for

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
https or just putting licious there

284
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,920
regardless as secured professionals

285
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,959
um

286
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
this is mainly going to target like

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
mobile users no one's going to log their

288
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,880
laptop around and try to scan a cursor

289
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
like that right

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
so

291
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
on top of that

292
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,880
a lot of what would be pretty effective

293
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
is mirrors or clones so if you try to

294
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
focus on making sure that your website

295
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
is not susceptible to

296
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,680
mirror or clone based attacks

297
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
and

298
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
you also keep your

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
website secure against cross-site

300
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
scripting or click jacking

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,399
then

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,519
you're

303
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
already going pretty far

304
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
and on top of that make sure you just

305
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
don't have like random qr codes around

306
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
your venue like if you're running a

307
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,959
thing

308
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
and there's a random qr code that you

309
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
didn't put there yourself

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
it's probably not

311
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
probably doesn't need to be there

312
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,839
but you don't need to place qr codes

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
ever right

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,920
so that was relatively a quick talk but

315
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
thank you for listening to my short

316
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
ramble

317
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,040
if you want to ramble more i'll be in

318
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
the pub

319
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
basically

320
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
so i don't have any short questions

321
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
i've tried

322
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
i've tried tried it against some

323
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,959
malicious

324
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
um links

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
and they just opened them immediately

326
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
the links i think the links were dead

327
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
though so the sites that they were

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
accessing were weren't like active

329
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
so maybe if the sites were active it

330
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
would have thrown something out but it

331
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,959
just immediately opens a web like opens

332
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
a browser

333
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
which is just kind of a bit

334
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,240
not nice regardless

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
um

336
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
that's the only one that i could find

337
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,920
the advertised

338
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
like checking

339
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
um

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
but again like uh

341
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,000
google lens like works really well i

342
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
think they talked about some like having

343
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
some more security to it at some point

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
but i'm not sure if that fell through

345
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,519
um

346
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
yeah the main thing is just

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
if you scan a link and it looks a bit

348
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,560
weird

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
like the url that i had

350
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
the official security url was

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
secure dash tay dot co dot uk and the

352
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,760
url and my qr codes outside are just

353
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
secure secure dash tay dot uk

354
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
so like it's the same as regular fishing

355
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
lines pay attention to what the link

356
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
looks like and if it looks a bit not

357
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,399
right

358
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
you don't need to click on it

359
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,680
yeah so uh currently uh

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,360
that's safer do you need to do the cure

361
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,760
um

362
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,600
[Music]

363
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
well from my understanding the

364
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
authentication methods like that

365
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,839
are

366
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,600
usually when the qr code gets generated

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
at use type and then doesn't

368
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
is like no longer valid after it's used

369
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
i'm pretty sure

370
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,079
in which case is relatively decent um

371
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
because that that is in those situations

372
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,240
i think the qr code is just being used

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,519
to store

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,760
like a key that's used as a one-time

375
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,800
password

376
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,399
um

377
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
versus like um

378
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
versus like a qr code that you'd leave

379
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,839
out on a table for someone to scan right

380
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,959
i'll also show this
