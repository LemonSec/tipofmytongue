1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,880
now into the boring stuff

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
so what are containers um in order to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
understand potatoes i'm really quickly

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
going to talk about what

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,799
the differences are between like

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,960
traditional virtualization so like your

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
virtual machines

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
um

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,039
so

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,519
what a virtual machine is is it uses

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,599
something called hypervisor

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
and it emulates your computer kernel and

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
all the hardware and all the software

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,599
your operating system the whole ship so

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,680
it's an entirely like

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
software-based computer

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,040
on your computer

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,280
um obviously problems with that it's

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,160
chunky it's slow

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,689
[Music]

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,480
it's not better

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,280
okay right perfect so

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
um containers try to solve some of these

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,799
problems um so they don't actually

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
traditionally they don't have hypervisor

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
um so they only emulate all the software

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
so they have to be obviously compatible

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,040
with whatever machine you're running on

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
um this makes them much more lightweight

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
so you can get a lot more containers in

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
the space you only get one vm

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
and it also makes a little more portable

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
which obviously is good if you're trying

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
to like ship out

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
um lots of containers and people you

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
don't have

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
to wait ages to set off and

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
although the problem with this is

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,079
they're not fully isolated as a result

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,960
so

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
you have to watch

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
breakouts a lot easier

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,799
and so you have to be careful

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,880
of what's your security on them

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,600
so docker straight in 2013 currently

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
uses container ds it's one time

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
and when people talk about docker

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
they're usually talking about like

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,000
docker engine

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
or dropper desktop and the docker has

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,600
tons of products to make up these are

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
just some of them there are others

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,840
um so real quick hub is an image

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
repository that's um all containers

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
built with images

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,120
um so that's where you get them you get

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
official and unofficial images

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
um so officials have been to apache all

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
that and unofficial anyone can make

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
images

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
um and upload them

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,840
account

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
docker engine um

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
that's just cli

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
and so that's what i'm mainly talking

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,319
about today yeah that's what we're going

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
to talk about today um use linux and

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,879
actually create run manage everything

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,120
docker got the desktop it's essentially

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
a gui version that you use for

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
windows um and then

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
yeah docker containers from windows are

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
all separate keller fish it's a

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
hypervisor uh hyperd or wsl2

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,720
they're all getting into that uh compose

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
this is yaml files so if you're wanting

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
to create lots and lots and lots of

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,000
containers or you've got a very specific

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
setup that you have

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
you chuck it in like a nice yama file so

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,040
you can like spin up whatever you want

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
and then drop a swarm um have you ever

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
heard of kubernetes

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,319
it's just the container orchestration

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
solution to swarm is docker's version of

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
kubernetes such lets you manage hundreds

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
of containers at once

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
um and it makes it a little bit easier

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,958
for you

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,920
so

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
vulnerabilities what's wrong with

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
containers

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,280
um i went on the myer database um

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,799
literally like

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,120
two days ago 194 cde records for docker

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
so there is a lot there's a lot out

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
there

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,440
um some i'm just going to go into some

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
we're going to go to all because we'll

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
be here all day

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
um some like vulnerabilities and

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
misconfigurations mainly i will say

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
however um not judging anyone if you're

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
running containers like this obviously

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
docker wouldn't let you do it there's no

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
purpose so there are reasons why people

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
run their containers like this it's not

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
like a gotcha moment you see someone

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
running their containers they're

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
probably just using it to debug

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
um because she's a privileged flag

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,560
not always a great idea because one

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
thing with containers like i said

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
previously they're not fully isolated so

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
even if you're not running them as a

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
super user if you have root access

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
inside that container and you break out

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
you then get root access in those

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
so

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
very dangerous as well

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
um adding extra capabilities and lots of

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
different resources circles without

123
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
saying

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
um you can use that to like damage the

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
host machine or any applications in the

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,840
container dot attacks the whole

127
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,120
oh how can you say

128
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
i kind of see that

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
i'm sorry this is my work here and it's

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,199
there we go no

131
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,719
this talks is going great

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
right

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
dangerous directories so

134
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
sometimes you need

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
some files resources applications that

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
are on your host machine you can mount

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
them into the container

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
absolutely fine not an issue but there

139
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
are certain directories you probably

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
don't want to be

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,199
allowing your container to have access

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
to etc bin

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,919
home sometimes you can put ssh keys

144
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
um to just be mindful of that

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
i did say i won't judge but if i see

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
anyone mounting your whole host file

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
system to your container i will find you

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
that's unacceptable what is the point of

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
using containers at that point

150
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
but it is something you can do i don't

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
know why you would

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
um and then running containers in the

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
host name space

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
so

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
um talk about namespace a second but

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
essentially

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
um namespaces restrict what

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
um

159
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
what processes can see and you've got a

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
host named space and if you tell a

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
container just to mount on to that you

162
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
can see all the processes of your host

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
and then you've messed up with them

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
which is

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
not a good thing and that's the flag

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
so more

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
unofficial images like i said anyone can

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,199
upload images um

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,400
it's a bit

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
it's a bit of a tricky game

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
some companies make their own versions

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,039
of images if our specific um

173
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,039
requirements is fine

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,520
um but just be mindful of what you're

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
pulling

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,680
so i study some research on 2020 and

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,639
they

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,360
scanned all the images in docker hub and

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,759
of the unofficial ones 74 of them had

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,240
medium and high rated vulnerabilities

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
compared to only 47 of the official ones

182
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
so

183
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
also in 2019 um a security research

184
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
company found

185
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,840
um

186
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,759
multiple um

187
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
containers that have cryptocurrency

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
mining malware on it and trojans of all

189
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
sorts and one of them in chicago had two

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
million pools

191
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,000
so there are containers out there that

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,599
are mining bitcoin people don't even

193
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,360
know

194
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
uh not regularly updating your images so

195
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
it's really easy to spin up a container

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
have it do something small and you just

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
leave it you ignore it you don't think

198
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
about it

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,199
but

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,280
you need to update it um it's not

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
difficult please do

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
but you need to be careful docker can be

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
a bit funny um so

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,639
it's easy just to be like oh update late

205
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
i'll just pull the latest image

206
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,199
even on official they forever are

207
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
releasing unstable images

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
so you can actually give yourself more

209
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,039
vulnerabilities than you initially had

210
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
and so always try and go for the latest

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
stable versions uh for example in 2020

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,479
there were 40 cds to occur

213
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
32 of them had the exact same

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
vulnerability all of them were given a

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
cvss score 10 for privilege escalation

216
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
every single one of them

217
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,360
the um root user password

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,560
so

219
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,319
again be very careful about what images

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,919
you're going uh like i said poison

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
images um

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
people are private malware things and

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,199
networking i'm not gonna go super into

224
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
networking but if you're exposing your

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
container to the internet be really

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
careful um there's currently an apt

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,879
called team tnt it sounds like a

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
minecraft server and if you google it

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
it's going to come up they're not

230
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
um and they essentially scour things

231
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,680
like showdown

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
and they're pretty indiscriminate uh

233
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
their main motivation is finance so even

234
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,599
if you're like just dual blogs they're

235
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
going to try and put cryptocurrency

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
money malware on your thing and they

237
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
don't care and if you want to know more

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
about their attacks you just say

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
something factually incorrect about them

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,640
twitter and your correction

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,679
right so is it all doom and gloom what

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
can you do

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
i have the solution

244
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,959
absolutions

245
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
uh i will also say none of these have to

246
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,920
be used like separately you can mix

247
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
match with minerals

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
so make spaces i didn't talk a little

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
bit about i can't really see last time

250
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
um so yeah they restrict what resources

251
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
are processed most children can see

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
um i have some people refer to it's like

253
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
almost called container light

254
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
um so it's not contained at all but so

255
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
essentially you put the

256
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
process in a little bubble where it

257
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
doesn't know it's being restricted

258
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
but it can't see what it's not allowed

259
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
to see so it thinks vibrancy that's it

260
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,560
um

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
yes so docker has a default namespace

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
that you can enable called docker remap

263
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
um and that first

264
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
file path and you just create

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,200
daemon.json and then you add in uh

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
essentially just use your ns remount

267
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
column default and you just like please

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
use the default interface

269
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
um and this bottom two are just where

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
you check seeing your spaces if this is

271
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
enabled

272
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
and it's a pretty good one um it's not

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,519
too destructive

274
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
but it just stopped for all minor things

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,519
c groups control groups um very similar

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,680
to namespaces um

277
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
but

278
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
the process knows it's being restricted

279
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
unlike new spaces where it has no it

280
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
can't see

281
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,079
secrets

282
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
and secrets are specifically for

283
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,800
hardware resources so like memory ram

284
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,880
memory uh cpu all that shenanigans so

285
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
really useful if you want to try and

286
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
prevent um

287
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
like gloss attacks and things like that

288
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
um again it's screenshot the safety job

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,320
but i just didn't really

290
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
i restricted memory and swap memory and

291
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
honestly it's like three lines of code

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
really easy to recommend

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
right getting into slightly more

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
complicated so app armor it is the

295
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
default linux security module used by

296
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
docker what is one of the security

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,560
questions well as the name suggests

298
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,399
it's a way of securing processes and

299
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,560
applications in products

300
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
um

301
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
and you get two types you get mandatory

302
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
access controls and discretion access

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
modules so

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
dac or discretion access control systems

305
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
are like the older ones

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
um

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
and they

308
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
put everything into put all the users

309
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
into groups and they restrict

310
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,600
the like users from access nodes like

311
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
group one you can see abc script two can

312
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
say abf

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,920
now the problem is it doesn't restrict

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
the processes the users are running so a

315
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
user can just run a process and be like

316
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,959
right now go talk to like c

317
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
and they can see it so um

318
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,920
they came up with mastery access which

319
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,880
is a little bit more modern

320
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
and they

321
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
are a lot stricter and they um restrict

322
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
processes

323
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
rather than just like user groups so the

324
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
processes themselves different systems

325
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,399
um armor itself is policy based so you

326
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,480
set little policies both um you're

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
running

328
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
and

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
docker has one called docker default

330
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,079
that you can set up um it's a bit funky

331
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
you can't really edit it and it sort of

332
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
like disappears from the file system

333
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
i don't know how to touch it and they

334
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
don't want you to touch it if you want

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,519
to create your own

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,920
um don't do it by hand just no it's

337
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,880
horrible

338
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
no one does um here's some nice madeline

339
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
tools you can use

340
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
um easy profane and my personal favorite

341
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
mainly because of the name is securely

342
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
and that is specifically that's the one

343
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
specifically for docker and the other

344
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,240
two are

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
less specific but they're really easy

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,279
just a couple lines of code you just

347
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,279
tell them what containers what's you're

348
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
thing he's going to be doing it and this

349
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,940
stuff might be at home

sc limits

352
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
the bane of my existence i'm going to be

353
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
honest it's also essential security

354
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
enhanced linux and it's also a mac

355
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
system and but it uses labels

356
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
to control access to like all your files

357
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
or your purchase everything's labeled

358
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
that sounds great and it is genuinely

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
more secure than our plumber

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
but it's absolute fafsa

361
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
like it's disgusting i would say unless

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
you're doing

363
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,519
unless you've got very sensitive stuff

364
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
or you're like working for a business or

365
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
whatever i wouldn't bother with essie

366
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
linux i'd just stick with armor like if

367
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,600
it's just you doing stuff you know

368
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
small application at home

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
hobby or something i wouldn't bother

370
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
um

371
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,079
but the reason i see linux is better

372
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,519
than our farmer

373
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
is mainly because

374
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
the logo is good it depends on the

375
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,519
sunglasses but also so app armor only

376
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
restricts docker whereas it doesn't like

377
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,519
restrict individual containers so

378
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
they're all got the same rule whereas

379
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,639
seo linux you can

380
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
make specific rules for each container

381
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
so if they need different amounts of

382
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
access you can do that

383
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,000
and it's great

384
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
and it's a lot more difficult to like

385
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
break out of the rules and stuff on it

386
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,079
so yeah

387
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,839
oh

388
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,079
second secure computing it is not an lsn

389
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920
it's not a linux security module

390
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
um but it's a kernel security thing

391
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,880
um

392
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
and it limits system calls that process

393
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
can make docker is a default one

394
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,519
it disables about 44 of your system

395
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,480
calls

396
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
um and i i'm honestly i wouldn't mess

397
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
about this too much it the

398
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
docker default one is pretty good uh

399
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
here are some of the

400
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
ones that disables so you've got acct

401
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,079
or account and it disabled you can use

402
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,320
it to disable resource limits

403
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
um delete module you can delete kernel

404
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
modules

405
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
and p trace so

406
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,720
p trace

407
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,199
um you can use to circumvent second

408
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
completely and the reason i have this

409
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
gift is because

410
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,040
even if you

411
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,760
have a second profile that restricts

412
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
that you can't do a single system called

413
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
you still run containers like oh they'll

414
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
let me do this

415
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
so if you're running a container and you

416
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
can't do anything but you've got ptrace

417
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,839
enabled

418
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,279
then there's no pull

419
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
like an attack can just

420
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,959
change everything and get out

421
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,560
so

422
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
i've spent this

423
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
right conclusions

424
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
be careful of what you're doing with

425
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
your containers make sure you're mindful

426
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
of why you're like what are you wanting

427
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
them to do so like do you need all those

428
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
resources do you need

429
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,839
um

430
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,040
that

431
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,639
file system mounted

432
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,160
uh new best friends i would honestly

433
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,959
recommend app armor s linux name spaces

434
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,720
secrets like try and set them all up

435
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,519
have a play with them if you get

436
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
no check on what's yours if you guys see

437
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,079
linux working like please

438
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
teach me um i would love to know i've

439
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
never successfully done it um

440
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
but yeah i honestly wouldn't bother like

441
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,199
day to day stuff but

442
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
i think if you want

443
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,920
um

444
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,320
sorry for the disaster that's been me

445
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,600
talking about

446
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
any questions also i have a cat want to

447
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
see my cat that's my story

448
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,040
that's not my first time

[Music]

451
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,789
[Music]

452
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,440
oh so

453
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
are there any tools that will

454
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
like tell you if you're potentially

455
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
running a horrible dinner

456
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
yeah i'm sure there are i've not looked

457
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,480
into that specifically um but i'm sure

458
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,519
there are

459
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
i know securely that i was talking about

460
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
earlier it does tell you if you're

461
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,319
trying to run a container that it

462
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,520
restricts

463
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,319
so

464
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,640
that might be something similar so it's

465
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,319
like you you said you don't have this

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,639
done

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
testing sorry i'd probably stick to vms

468
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
for that um because like i said

469
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,200
um

470
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,559
so my whole discussions into the

471
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,200
breakouts and it's shockingly easy

472
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
so you're honestly putting your whole

473
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
your whole thing at risk doing that but

474
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
if you've got it

475
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
i don't know even if you got it locked

476
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,799
down i wouldn't trust it

477
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
maybe let me know how it goes but

478
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
honestly i would stick to vm for that

479
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
yeah

480
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,390
[Music]

481
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
so

482
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
are you asking if i would use containers

483
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,850
as honeypots or vms

484
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,160
[Music]

485
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
um i don't know too much about honeybots

486
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
um

487
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
i mean if you want people

488
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,000
to like

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,360
go for it

490
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
i guess containers are more attractive

491
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
so later

492
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,679
and people don't have to install as much

493
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,760
because like vms are massive um

494
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
yeah i don't know that's a good question

495
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
i don't know i don't have an answer

496
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,120
though

497
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,000
yeah

498
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
i was gonna say on the mother

499
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,320
entertainer's probably not the

500
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
to be best application containers that

501
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
don't take long for immune system

502
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,200
or like the web browser

503
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
you'd better rock work or something like

504
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,679
that

505
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
but even

506
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,320
anyone else

507
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,080
thank you
