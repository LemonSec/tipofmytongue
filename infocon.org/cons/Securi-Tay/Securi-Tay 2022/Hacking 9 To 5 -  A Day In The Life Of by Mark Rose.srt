1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,000
right so hacking 95 a day in the life of

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
so thank you for all being patient and

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,840
staying with me through the the problems

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,800
it's working now it's all that matters

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
so that's it so

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
this talk

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,680
is about a pen testing and

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
what to expect in the other life of so

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,439
i'm a pen tester

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
and i've been pen testing for quorum

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,960
cyber for

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
um three years now

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
uh prior to that i have been pentesting

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,280
for another three years so cumulative

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
six years pen testing experience

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,160
and i was an ethical hacking student

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
here in abertay and i graduated in 2016.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
so that's a basic summary of me so how

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,480
many of you have thought about being pen

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,039
testers

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
okay and how many of you have given

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,199
other

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
other areas of cyber security thought or

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,640
is it just

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,239
it's a lot obvious

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
so that's perfect so that's it

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,280
so as i say this talk is about what to

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
expect of pen tesla the reason for this

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
talk was when i was a student here i

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
kind of knew i wanted to be a pen tester

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
i knew what i wanted to do but there

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
wasn't a lot of information about what

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,600
to expect out there so pen testing isn't

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
exactly what i was expecting when i

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
graduated but i'm glad that it's not and

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
it's basically helped refine me to this

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
profession that i am now

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,799
so it's going to cover the engagements

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,640
that are frequently encountered on a pen

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
test engagement

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
people may encounter in general not just

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
on pentest engagements and this is

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
basically aimed towards people who are

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,920
looking to take their first steps into

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
pen testing

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
so this is just a brief summary of my

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,840
day-to-day overview luckily a quorum

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,280
cyber i get the ability to work from

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
home so i could wake up relatively late

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,560
and so it speaks still before nine it's

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
quite good if you're a bit

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,719
of a bad morning person i get out of my

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,600
bed i can make myself a coffee have some

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,639
breakfast

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
get down to my office and check my

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,239
emails direct messages reply to

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,959
what what basically

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
reply to people who have contacted me

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
could that be clients give me employees

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
looking for help just to basically

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,120
assist them

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,920
once that started and then start my day

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,720
testing and just juggle my testing

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,599
through

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
through the day between the means that i

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
carry out

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
so the

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
penetration testing journey

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,640
so it's not just testing so that's the

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
first thing i'd like to say people just

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,319
expect you're going to be put out in

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
front of people

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
and you're giving a website to test so

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
you're giving infrastructure to test

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
it's not always that it's a whole

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
journey from start to finish whereby

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
you interact with the clients

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
at an early stage and through to the

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
final cause of the engagement

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
so there's three sort of three-star main

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
sections here as you see the pre-sales

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,040
the delivery and the reporting stage

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
so we're going to start off with your

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
sort of your pre-sale stuff

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
so initially

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
you are first brought into your sort of

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
pen test and engagement and pen and

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
environment in your scope and call with

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,879
the customer

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,319
so the customer calls you and

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
basically says look i'm looking for this

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
test i want a pen test done and

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
pentest means very different things to

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
different people

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
so people come in like i want a pen test

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
they've heard the term that's what they

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,840
want

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
so it's our jobs along with the sales

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
people to find out exactly why they want

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,959
testing exactly what they want tested

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,440
and what elements they are most

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
concerned about

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
so this is your first interaction with

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
the clients i've mentioned

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
to me is important you are the face of

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
the test and team at this stage you need

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,959
to

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
to paint this professional image to help

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
help the company give off this good

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,159
thing with ethos to make sure that they

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,799
are the right person for the testing

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,080
because a test engagement with the

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599
customers

114
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,560
so

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
it gives you the chance to ask them

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
questions i've mentioned

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
so you kind of want to understand why

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
they want testing done so is it for

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
compliance reasons is that they want to

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
improve their security posture or is it

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,360
just they have to have a checkbox a

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
little bit saying a customer wants us to

123
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
get a pen test done can we get something

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,000
so you get this whole spectrum

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,320
of people coming in for tests

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160
as i say you get to ask your relevant

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
questions so i had someone come up to me

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,919
earlier on to do for the day asking if

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
we carry a load balance and test it so

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
obviously we don't carry out load

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
balancing testing so it's denial of

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
service if you were to toss a customer's

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
real environment that's bad you don't

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,800
want to

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
cost them money you don't want to have

136
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,040
downtime for it so

137
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
one of the questions you could ask at

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
the scope and stages for example is

139
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
do you have a uet environment so do you

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
have a testing environment do you have a

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,440
development environment and if so does

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
this directly replicate life and

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
obviously the reason behind this is to

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
make sure

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
that

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
this environment can be used as an

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,919
alternative for testing so you can be a

148
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,880
bit more free reign you can basically go

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
a little bit more vigorously without

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,880
worrying about knocking it over or

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
polluting their live databases

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
so

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
again

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
it's just basically making sure that the

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
customer has

156
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
a good overall experience of testing a

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,800
good overall experience of the

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
engagement so if you have a bad

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
engagement they're less likely to come

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
back it just

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
helps paint a better image

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
and ultimately it gets you to the point

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
whereby you can understand what services

164
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
they would actually benefit from

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,039
so

166
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
that pen test terms thrown around they

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
come and say i want a web test or i want

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
an internal test you've asked questions

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
and you've found out that their their

170
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,720
main concern is their external posture

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
so why have they asked

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
they say they want an internal test if

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
their main concern is their external

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
facing network you would tailor

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
something around this and then you would

176
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,960
say the end goal is to ultimately get

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
you to the point where by your concern

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
would then move to your internal aspect

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
and then at that point you could then

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
carry out an internal test

181
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
so the next stage of testing is your

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,240
sales support and proposal writing

183
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
so you've collected all this information

184
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
from the client on the scoping section

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
you have

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
asked them the questions you've noted

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,919
down and this is the point whereby you

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
help create the first document that is

189
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
delivered to the client

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,280
so this in my opinion is an important

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
very important document because

192
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
from the get-go this is the standard of

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
work that they would be thinking about

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
expecting so to me it's important that

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,759
it's

196
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
it's clear concise and

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
basically just

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,520
easy to follow and so they can

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,319
understand exactly what they are getting

200
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,160
so again i've said

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
clear and concise the completeness is

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
important as i mentioned so you want

203
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,280
this document to summarize testing you

204
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
want it to

205
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,440
include the targets that the customer is

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
wanting tested

207
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
and you want to include the effort and

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
if it's an objective based test you want

209
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
to include the objectives so at the end

210
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
of the day the tester who comes behind

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
you to do this engagement can get the

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
one document there and be like this is

213
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
my target this is what i want

214
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
and then they can go to do it

215
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
so following on from your sales support

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
you get to your active active delivery

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
of the engagement the testing so to me

218
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,360
this is the

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
the bet where i get most enjoyment not

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,879
that the other bits are bad it's

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,080
obviously

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,120
just

223
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
what i enjoy that's why i do pen testing

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
so this is the active delivery so prior

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
to testing you have a couple of

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,280
prerequisites

227
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
so you can't just target anything you

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
kind of need to say hey you do need to

229
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
have appropriate authorization in place

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
you can't just randomly head a website

231
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
if you do you're obviously

232
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
not an authorization you're breaking the

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
computer missions at so you want to make

234
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
sure everything is in place that you

235
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,080
have written consent saying you have

236
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
authorization to test this

237
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
target between this date and this state

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
and if anything were to go wrong you can

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
go back and say well actually you've

240
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,240
said here that

241
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
i'm allowed to do this and obviously

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
you've signed our terms and conditions

243
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,519
and that's fine

244
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,080
and you again in in discussion with the

245
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
targets you want to make sure they are

246
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
exactly what is expected

247
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
uh if there's any doubt ever in place

248
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,519
you just go back to the client be like

249
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,399
look

250
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,440
i've got this

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
discrepancy is this to be expected and

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
again it's basically covering yourself

253
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
to make sure that you are actually

254
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
hitting what you have authorization for

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
and

256
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
basically are

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
ready to do

258
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
again prior to testing you need to

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
provide the organizations your test and

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
ipe ranges this is so if they have any

261
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
wasps or web application firewall or an

262
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
intrusion prevention system they can

263
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
allow you through it so obviously

264
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
attackers have unlimited time

265
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
whereas us as pen testers we have a set

266
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
duration of time we can try to get

267
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,480
around the wife and ips however

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
with the time there it's not going to

269
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
with the time time restriction we have

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
it might not be possible it might just

271
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
continually deny us testing so if you

272
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
allow us through we've got a greater

273
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
chance of covering the

274
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
the basic

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,600
coverage of the application and

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
make sure that

277
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,160
it's

278
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
basically we find as many possible

279
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,680
issues in the testing window that we

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,959
have

281
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
and another important thing for testing

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,399
is

283
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,120
continual communication with clients

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
so

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
if you have an engagement in my opinion

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
it's important to liaise with your

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
target if you speak to them you are

288
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
basically saying look i'm about to start

289
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
testing on the day i'm about to stop

290
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
testing so that way they can keep an eye

291
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
on anything that's happening if anything

292
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
happens out with this allocated window

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
they know it's not us and you can treat

294
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
it as a real incident and follow the

295
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
correct escalation cool calls that they

296
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
have in place or escalation policies

297
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
in line with communication

298
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,200
critical issues should always be

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
communicated as quickly as possible to

300
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,279
the client so for example if you've

301
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
found the sql injection

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
and this sql injection allows you

303
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
back-end access to their database you

304
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
can get password hashes for their

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
application users you don't want this to

306
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
be publicly accessible for a prolonged

307
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
duration of time you'd always want phone

308
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,079
of the client once you've obviously got

309
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,320
your proof that is possible you phone up

310
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,079
the client i look i found this issue

311
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,279
here

312
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
and

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
this issue is replicable

314
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
by following the steps

315
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,279
and allows them to make an issue whilst

316
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
you're testing so that way once they've

317
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,079
done it you can follow back and say this

318
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
issue is no longer present you have

319
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
successfully been able to

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
to resolve it

321
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and despite this you would still include

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,640
that in the in the report and this is

323
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
just basically so that they can

324
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
they have order that in order to show

325
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
that it was there

326
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,880
and you can then document that same

327
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
that

328
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,279
the test the development team have

329
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
followed good practice they've responded

330
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
in a timely manner to resolve the issue

331
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
that is important at uh pentest report

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
as well which i will discuss later is

333
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
basically you don't always want it to be

334
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,839
negative you want to put in positives as

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
well so a penta pen test report can be a

336
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
negative thing but you want to try to

337
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
put a positive spin on it so that it's

338
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,639
not just we're not just tearing down

339
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
what works being put in place you want

340
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
to refer reaffirm

341
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
what's done well

342
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
so you're reporting

343
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
so this is arguably the most important

344
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,279
element for

345
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
for the client for the test so

346
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
everything prior to this

347
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,360
has just been um

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
it's just been theoretical you say

349
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
you've done your testing you see you've

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
done this

351
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,959
but what has the client got to show at

352
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,000
this point

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
nothing they have literally nothing to

354
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
show that you have done any work

355
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,720
so arguably is the most important

356
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
element and to say ultimately is the

357
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
product that the customer pays for

358
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,920
so the important factors in a report is

359
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
you want the report to be clear so you

360
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
want to say this is the issue

361
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,519
and

362
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
the i found then such in such a location

363
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
so i found the nexus issue within the

364
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
search search functionality on your

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,279
website

366
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,000
then you want to be concise and say

367
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,160
basically what the impact is so the

368
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,639
impact of xss is obviously

369
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,000
what is

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,040
and

371
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,120
you want the report to be the shape

372
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
you're applicable so you want to supply

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,240
some sort of proof like a get request

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
saying so that they can literally copy

375
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
and paste it directly into the url so

376
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
once that they have once they have

377
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
addressed the issue they can test

378
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
themselves whether or not the issue is

379
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
still present

380
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
so

381
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
this is

382
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
why it's important so

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
they need this audit trail to see the

384
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,959
works being done

385
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
once the work's been done you're telling

386
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
them where all their issues are

387
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
and you're giving them the point whereby

388
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,279
they can

389
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,480
resolve them they can address the issues

390
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
so status tracking as well as i've

391
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
mentioned for example the sqli injection

392
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
stuff that i mentioned a minute ago did

393
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,199
hypothetically replicate remediated that

394
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,240
during

395
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
the

396
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
during the test by having this ability

397
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
to stash track we can then mark that as

398
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
the issue has been remediated rather

399
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
than just putting in a different section

400
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,959
in the report

401
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,480
so again

402
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
as i mentioned communication on areas

403
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
are implemented well if you can

404
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
communicate what you've done well that

405
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,600
helps the

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
helps the organization justify the

407
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
development team which in the end will

408
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,480
help justify

409
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,079
the testing that they're carrying out

410
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
so once testing's been done there is a

411
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
post-test follow-up section

412
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,480
so

413
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
this is the chance to touch base with

414
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,800
the client again this is where they've

415
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,959
had the report for a couple of weeks

416
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
you can speak to them and say look do

417
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
you have any questions about any of the

418
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
findings

419
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
or is there anything that we can offer

420
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
you

421
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
further that that's not been covered in

422
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,680
this report

423
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
and it just opens up the communication

424
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
channels again and it allows them to

425
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,880
provide feedback on what they

426
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
experienced was good and what they

427
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,240
experienced was bad so that we can

428
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
basically refine the process

429
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
and help care for better engagements

430
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,399
moving forward

431
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,560
so that's the basic summary of the the

432
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
pen testing journey so hopefully that

433
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
gets across the point of it it's not

434
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
just your testing and that there is

435
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,160
other elements to it

436
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
so after that how many of you are still

437
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,880
thinking about pen testing

438
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
okay so i'm not putting too many people

439
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
off so that's good

440
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
so we're going to cover the types of

441
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
tests and experience as a new tester i

442
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
can only speak on my behalf

443
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,199
so these are the type of things that i

444
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
experienced when i graduated my first

445
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,120
role and ultimately they helped

446
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,399
helped shape

447
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
me into the test that i am now and

448
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,360
hit hold the basics that i've learned

449
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
and used throughout my

450
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
my job so far

451
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
so the first type of testing that you

452
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
would experience as a new tester could

453
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
be your web application testing

454
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
and your web application testing has

455
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
sort of three main categories

456
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,240
uh your brochure rare your

457
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
unauthenticate and your authenticated

458
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
testing so have any has heard of

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
brochure we're testing before

460
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,800
no

461
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
so brochure testing can be described as

462
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,680
purely an informational site with no

463
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,959
sort of login element no

464
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,680
no way for clients to use further

465
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
functionality that was present on the

466
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
application so your brochure we're sort

467
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
of an informational website you try to

468
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
try to think of an example of top of my

469
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,199
head but i can't um

470
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
whereby it's just information supplied

471
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
to them and they read off that's that

472
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
your unauthenticated testing is

473
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,399
obviously when your client gives you a

474
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
web application

475
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
and they say try to break in try to

476
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,199
bypass the authentication mechanism and

477
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
see what you can do as if you were as if

478
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,399
you were an illegitimate attacker who is

479
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
trying to just

480
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
break in

481
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,800
so

482
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
unauthenticated testing can have some

483
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
authenticated element if you find a

484
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
self-registration page on the

485
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,919
application if it has this self

486
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,599
registration you are within scope to

487
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,559
then follow through the self

488
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
registration process and then test the

489
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
authenticated element behind

490
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
and your third main category of web

491
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,240
application testing is your

492
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
authenticated content so you're

493
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
authenticated take the test and this is

494
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
when it's an application that doesn't

495
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,679
allow self registration

496
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,959
it's just purely a website for example

497
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,360
employees use but without having an

498
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
employee number or some sort of way of

499
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
identifying who you are you cannot

500
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
self-register

501
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
so that's that

502
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
and that's basically the three main

503
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
categories

504
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,919
so these web application engagements can

505
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,880
be tailored to clients needs

506
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
so not every client as i've mentioned

507
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,400
has the same requirements

508
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
um

509
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
they can be objective based coverage

510
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,760
based or focused on risk levels so all

511
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
depends on what your clients budget

512
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,919
budget is and what you've discussed in

513
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,760
the scope and session so if it's an

514
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
objective based test for example get to

515
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
this back end database that's your

516
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
objective if you can't demonstrate this

517
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
objective it's not being let's say it's

518
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
not going to success it has been because

519
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
obviously you've you've demonstrated

520
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
it's not possible

521
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,360
and whereas your coverage base is here's

522
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,480
a web app find as much as you can

523
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
and your specific risk levels it could

524
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
be for clients who don't have much of a

525
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
budget whether i look i'm only

526
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,640
interested in heiser criticals

527
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
find them report that

528
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,120
so some good good things that i've used

529
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,679
for learning web application testing

530
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,280
has been like the

531
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
oscp i learned a lot about web

532
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
application testing doing that when i've

533
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
done it understandably it's changed from

534
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
when i first passed however

535
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
i can only speak on my experience of it

536
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
there is goods learning opportunities

537
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
there to

538
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,280
to basically learn the basic

539
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
fundamentals that can help shape your

540
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
career

541
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,840
so your web application test typically

542
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,720
follows a methodology

543
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
and this methodology

544
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
helps ensure that you're covering the

545
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
applications in full and complete scope

546
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
so for example some methodologies are

547
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
your olaf or your oss tmm

548
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
typically you'll find people use a

549
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,960
hybrid of both and they all have their

550
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,160
own their own specific one that they use

551
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
and basically you shouldn't use it to

552
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
ensure that the application is covered

553
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
off

554
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,840
so

555
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,559
these methodologies all follow a basic

556
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,760
structure

557
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
and the basic structure is your

558
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,240
reconnaissance so this is your like nmap

559
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
scans of the website what information

560
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,840
can be found

561
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,679
can this information is basically

562
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,600
painted a picture of that

563
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
and this information can be then used to

564
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,880
tailor towards further attacks

565
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,679
your

566
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
server levels so the client wants your

567
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
underlying infrastructure done you would

568
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,520
then start trying to touch these pores

569
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,919
that are being found open you see if

570
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,679
there's anything to be exploited at

571
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,679
infrastructure level

572
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,840
and you would then move on to your

573
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
authentication issues so authentication

574
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
issues are a lot more common than what

575
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,320
you'd expect so some real life examples

576
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
of what i have found during testing with

577
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,559
authentication issues is

578
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
does it actually check for a password

579
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
so you think surely all applications

580
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
nowadays would check whether or not a

581
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
password is present

582
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
however there's a vulnerability called

583
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
failopen whereby is only checking for

584
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
the username string and once you've sent

585
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
the request you can then delete the

586
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,039
password and you're able to log in i

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,440
found that quite recently on a web

588
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
application test i was doing and was

589
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,000
able to log in without having a password

590
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
not good when you're a large company who

591
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
is trying to care for clients and all

592
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
their sensitive information is present

593
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
so that was basically another thing well

594
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
basically

595
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
i was able to take advantage of that

596
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
from an unauthorized point to

597
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,320
authenticate into the application

598
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
without having

599
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
any valid credential sets

600
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
so another example of an authentication

601
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,799
issue is

602
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,520
does an application actually

603
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,120
check for the session token does it not

604
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,000
so

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
one that i was able to do on a very

606
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,039
similar application to the

607
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,960
aforementioned one was it was using a

608
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
header so the header's name was for

609
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,640
example username colon it was like my my

610
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
name mark rose is the token

611
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
however i was able to change this to

612
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
admin

613
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,400
and successfully become an admin just by

614
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
changing one word once i had logged in

615
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
so so going from low level tab in this

616
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
case i'm just deleting a word and adding

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,159
another

618
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,120
again

619
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,200
ultimately these are simple security

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,919
issues that you need to look for as a

621
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,080
tester

622
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
so the next level after that would be

623
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,919
your your authentication as it just

624
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
mentions authorization sorry your

625
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
authorization issues

626
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,520
so authorization issues lie aloud around

627
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,640
your

628
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
for example insecure direct object

629
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,280
reference how many of yous know what

630
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
idol is

631
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
okay perfect so a couple of you so

632
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,880
basically within the url and there could

633
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,760
be example an id equals 12.

634
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
if you're able to abuse that you are

635
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
then able to

636
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
then access a resource that you're not

637
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
supposed to have access to

638
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
so

639
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
another example that i found when

640
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
testing a web app was i logged in

641
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
went to my profile section of the

642
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,880
application

643
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,080
and i noticed within the request there

644
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,159
was using a backend api

645
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,600
and within the api url there was for

646
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,799
example get slash api slash user

647
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,240
12 slash profile so i was able to change

648
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,840
that slash 12 to slash one to view the

649
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,640
admin page once i had viewed the admin

650
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,400
page i noticed i was actually able to

651
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
edit so it wasn't checking to make sure

652
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,000
i had the proper authority to edit this

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,960
page

654
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
once this i was there i decided you know

655
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,159
i'm going to change this admins um email

656
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,320
address so admin's email address then

657
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
was changed to mine i was able to use

658
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
the forgotten your password function

659
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
once i logged out to reset admins

660
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,240
password to log in as an admin

661
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
and you have your

662
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,120
miscellaneous slash injection issues so

663
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,720
this is where you would test for your

664
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,559
likes of your xss your sql injection

665
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,559
your xxe

666
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
and your server side request forgery

667
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,919
so server side request 4g is when you're

668
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
able to trick the back-end server into

669
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
making a request to a resource that you

670
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,559
control so another example of a

671
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
vulnerability that i found was testing

672
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,159
was

673
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
one of the applications allowed

674
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,440
allowed a user to create a list

675
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,600
this list was then created and whilst

676
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,880
when it was created the year the media

677
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,760
request and it looked for a specific

678
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,640
image as a cover cover form

679
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
so

680
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
what you could do is you could change

681
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,279
this cover photo to a url that is in

682
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
your control

683
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
and

684
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,679
that was the list saved at that point

685
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
there was nothing wrong your image was

686
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,039
just loaded in

687
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,000
but

688
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
what this web application allowed you to

689
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
do it allowed you to

690
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,039
export this list to a pdf

691
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
and once the

692
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,200
list was exported the server looked for

693
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,279
the image because obviously it puts in

694
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,520
this pdf and the server then made a

695
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
request to the asset that you're in

696
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,480
control of

697
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
and

698
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
that's it you have control of the server

699
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
at that point you're able to gain remote

700
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,559
access if you play your cards right

701
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,279
so the next type of testing that i

702
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,200
experienced as

703
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
a graduate was external infrastructure

704
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,799
so external infrastructure is an

705
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,440
assessment of your perimeter systems

706
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
so this is typically a client who comes

707
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
in like i want to know what everything

708
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
that's out there that we own

709
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,200
can you do tell us so yes we can but we

710
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
redo your external infrastructure and

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
allows the clients to gain an

712
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,960
understanding of their security posture

713
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,080
and

714
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,840
determine if the firewall rules that

715
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,640
they have implemented are correct

716
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,279
and if so we tell them this is what's

717
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,200
found they can then go back to their

718
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
firewall be like yep that matches we're

719
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
all good or if not we found

720
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
for example our rdp connection so we're

721
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
able to get a remote desktop into this

722
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,200
environment

723
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
and we could potentially use the

724
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,200
information we gave previously in the

725
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,520
engagement to obtain a valid credential

726
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
set to then log in and have access to

727
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
their internal network and then from

728
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
there you'd start trying to move

729
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,960
laterally and vertically to

730
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
obtain domain admin and basically be in

731
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,480
control

732
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
so your approach for an external

733
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
infrastructure test varies on client

734
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
requirements

735
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,039
so

736
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,600
some clients only want a low interaction

737
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
where we want to tool and give them the

738
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
output

739
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,679
so

740
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,600
it's a bit boring and you only kind of

741
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
verify your manual stuff you're sorry

742
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
your mind your critical or high stuff

743
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
however

744
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
this

745
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,679
this is good in some aspects but it

746
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,840
doesn't in my opinion allow complete

747
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
coverage

748
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,159
whereas

749
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,159
my personal approach to action would be

750
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,080
what i would call high interaction

751
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,559
whereby we do everything possible so we

752
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,960
found that snt people are open for

753
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,279
example so that's um mail for example

754
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,600
your emails so can we connect into this

755
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
mailbox yes once we connect 10 is it

756
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
possible to mail smith so mail spoofing

757
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
is the ability ability to pretend to

758
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
belong within this organization so you

759
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
would issue the correct commands

760
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
to say

761
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,760
i am for example mark at

762
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,840
this

763
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,399
company.com

764
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,520
and i want to send this email to

765
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,159
mycontact.thiscompany.com

766
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
and then from there you can if the

767
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
client then replies by saying yep that's

768
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,559
um i received that email that's fine it

769
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,640
could be used for example fishing or

770
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
whaling where you start trying to target

771
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,120
your

772
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,039
more high level up

773
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
and high level up people in the company

774
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
to obtain a valid credential set which

775
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
could be then used

776
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,679
and compare nm in correlation with that

777
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
rdp poor that i've hypothetically made

778
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
up in my head

779
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,919
to log in and that's it you've then

780
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,399
became for example the id man of the

781
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,919
company

782
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,640
at that point you can do what you want

783
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
and again the testing structure and

784
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,880
methodology

785
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
for the external infrastructure ailment

786
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
is more varied it's

787
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
there's not for example an exact thing

788
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
you should follow all depends on the

789
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,520
services

790
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,679
that are located during the testing

791
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,080
window

792
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
and the third one

793
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
you might experience during testing is

794
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
what we call an assumed breach

795
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
so if any has heard of a soon breach

796
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
testing before

797
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,159
no so assume breach testing is

798
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,520
ultimately an assessment of the

799
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,799
organization's internal network it's

800
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,279
similar to an internal test however

801
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,919
we are taking the point on their network

802
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,520
that we have previously discussed the

803
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
thumb so the perspective the point or

804
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
the perspective could be for example

805
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,679
we've walked into their organization

806
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
we've plugged in a laptop what can we

807
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,120
see we can do

808
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,399
so

809
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,440
can we

810
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
obtain a password hash using the tools

811
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
and can we replay this password hash to

812
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
then start in person in this user

813
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,360
or we have we can mimic an account a

814
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
current compromise via efficient so we

815
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
would use a command and control set a

816
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,279
command and control tool command and

817
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,480
control center to send an email to the

818
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
organization and try to trick their end

819
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
users into clicking this link which

820
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,559
would then provide the hook back into

821
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
our command and control center and we

822
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,919
can start

823
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,080
trying to move laterally or vertically

824
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
around their environments to obtain the

825
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
main advent

826
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,840
another way we could look at this is

827
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,159
your credentials compromised so they

828
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,919
just provide us credentials so we've

829
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,159
pretended that we could compromise these

830
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,919
credential sets with them they've

831
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
provided them we can log in and they

832
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
ultimately run

833
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
run the exact command that we need to

834
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
get the hook back to the commander

835
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,279
control so as you can see there's

836
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
various different ways

837
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,080
that we can do this and it all comes

838
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
down to client budget again which you

839
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
have communicated with and you've

840
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
tailored it to

841
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,240
to their requirements

842
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
so hope you can see that pentest isn't

843
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
just testing it as you may think there's

844
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,080
a lot of communication with the client

845
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
prior a lot of communication during and

846
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
a lot of communication after

847
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
and your assumed breach testing is is

848
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,919
often objective driven so it's not a

849
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,120
case of what can you find it's

850
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,799
an objective driven test so can you get

851
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,880
to the main admin so for example i was

852
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,120
testing an internal organizer an

853
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
organization's internal network

854
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,880
they said right can you get to da

855
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
so obviously as the tester you obviously

856
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
want to

857
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,960
to make sure that you meet their goal

858
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
and that is possible so for example an

859
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,919
example i found

860
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,840
in during testing was a client had

861
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
multiple network shares visible

862
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,240
within their network shares

863
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,039
there was a member of the iit team who

864
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,120
had their folders accessible to everyone

865
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
on the network

866
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,880
within these folders there was a regis

867
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,360
registry key and within the registry key

868
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
there was a username password and clear

869
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,919
text for a service account

870
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,480
and there was basically

871
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
if i recall correctly there was five or

872
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,919
six of these service accounts each one

873
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,519
incremented by one

874
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,600
and you had with compromising this

875
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,840
registry key you had the password and

876
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,039
username combination for all six users

877
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,919
so

878
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,279
once you've found that when i went

879
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:31,760
a back to

880
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
we use called um

881
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
bloodhounds

882
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
so basically it's an ingester for sharp

883
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,799
hands whereby it assesses that the

884
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,039
directory in a quick manner you put it

885
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,720
in and it visualizes the

886
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
high level

887
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,320
and i basically

888
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,080
create clouds and said i've compromised

889
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,399
this user what is the shortest path to

890
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,799
domain admin from here turned out that

891
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,080
user had

892
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,000
right all access on

893
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
and i was able to use the right all

894
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,159
access to make myself the main user that

895
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,760
was it

896
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
that's how is it

897
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,159
okay and other types of tests then that

898
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,120
we do uh do now and other types of

899
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,360
testing that are available

900
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,240
are

901
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
so you're basically telling you they

902
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,240
aren't just tied into one or two

903
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
types of tests and there is a large

904
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,399
volume you can go into and you can

905
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
specialize in whatever you want

906
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,399
so the other types of testing that are

907
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,880
available are your mobile applications

908
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,799
your ios and your android application

909
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,000
testing

910
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
are you able to find any issues within

911
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,960
that so

912
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
i must admit i'm not a master and any of

913
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
my master in any of the testing i've

914
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,399
mentioned or this

915
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,039
but you just mentioned other stuff that

916
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,159
are available your source code review so

917
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
they prove the client provides you the

918
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,840
source code of the application two thing

919
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,480
vulnerabilities so a source code review

920
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
can be

921
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,880
provided alongside a web app test and i

922
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
personally would call that a source code

923
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
driven pen test so you can use the web

924
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
application front end that you have and

925
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,799
you can use the source code that's

926
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,120
provided to kind of tailor the issues

927
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
and find them in a faster manner than if

928
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,320
you were

929
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,399
looking at your breakout testing so

930
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,880
if a client uses a citrix environment

931
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,519
which is a lockdown desktop verbs don't

932
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,320
know

933
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
uh are you able to

934
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,919
break up this environment to gain a

935
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
command prompt and then start trying to

936
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,600
move laterally like the assumed breach

937
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,559
test and i just mentioned

938
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,120
your social engineering testing

939
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,000
so

940
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
are you able to break into building can

941
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
you use the information provided to gain

942
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,360
physical access can you use public

943
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
information to obtain valid credential

944
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,519
sets like your phishing

945
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,039
your wireless assessments just walk in

946
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,200
scan the wireless that's a

947
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,960
web service assessment api your

948
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,559
vulnerability assessments which ties

949
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,159
into your external sort of

950
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,840
infrastructure and

951
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
again you just run the vulnerabilities

952
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and your cloud security assessments with

953
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,480
the cloud becoming more

954
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
more

955
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,399
more pre

956
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
common now

957
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,199
so common tooling that i experience as a

958
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,320
tester

959
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,359
is barb sweet nick told wp so it's just

960
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,399
the less they'll let you read it

961
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,800
relatively loud

962
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,599
and

963
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,320
that says all these tools are worth

964
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,679
worth learning and worth investing in

965
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,320
so that's the end of the talk does

966
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,359
anyone have any questions or anything

967
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,359
yes

968
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,359
so it varies on what the client wants

969
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,000
but typically a web application test

970
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
would be five days worth of effort on a

971
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,199
common web application external

972
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,599
infrastructure it varies depending on

973
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,599
the ip addresses and the services that

974
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,000
they have so commonly you're looking at

975
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,079
again like three four days and it's not

976
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,879
a large volume

977
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,640
uh you mentioned the last role is

978
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
okay so

979
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,280
i probably should explain that whilst i

980
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
was doing it but good question thank you

981
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,680
so your lateral movement is going from

982
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
user a to user b

983
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,920
whereas your vehicle these users both

984
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
are on the same user role and both part

985
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,720
of the same same ad groups

986
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
your vertical movement could be going

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,560
from user a to user z and user z being

988
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,200
an admin so you move laterally around

989
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,599
the environment trying to learn

990
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
more and more by compromising other

991
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,839
users of the same level

992
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,119
and your vertical is going from user to

993
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,119
admin

994
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:54,250
[Music]

995
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
so typically

996
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,839
presuming you mean taylor made by

997
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,760
interacting with the client so we meet

998
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
though every single test would be

999
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
tailor-made to a client requirement

1000
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
whether that be they just want a web

1001
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,839
application test or not so you're you do

1002
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
have the same checks you run but you're

1003
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,079
not going to be doing uh

1004
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
a test without speaking to the client to

1005
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,599
understand where their concerns lie does

1006
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,119
that answer you

1007
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,839
yeah perfect

1008
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,520
yeah is um so i'm guessing the most

1009
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,000
important part of them all is reporting

1010
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
yes um

1011
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,200
how automated is that

1012
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,119
like it looks very repetitive but if

1013
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
it's very repetitive that means a lot of

1014
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,800
things can be reused from report to

1015
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,320
report

1016
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
yeah so

1017
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
it depends on where you go it could be a

1018
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,520
hands-on process or an automated process

1019
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,960
what we have is we have this thing

1020
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
called the knowledge base and the

1021
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
knowledge base has the basic information

1022
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,400
on youtube as you've mentioned written

1023
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,480
up already so we would use that from

1024
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
report to report but within the

1025
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,599
vulnerabilities we will add in the exact

1026
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,920
specifications of the issues that we

1027
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,119
find so it is quite uh a manual process

1028
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,200
by the sense of your copying and pasting

1029
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
it across

1030
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
but it is already written up for you

1031
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,839
there it's just the case of adding in

1032
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,320
this the specifics of the vulnerability

1033
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,480
so the client can follow what

1034
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
what's being found

1035
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,910
like everyone says don't go into context

1036
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,040
[Music]

1037
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,920
yeah exactly the report isn't a bad

1038
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,119
thing

1039
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,280
it's important to learn how to report

1040
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960
though it's not a case of you want to

1041
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
copy and paste there's a very specific

1042
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
way you want to present to the client so

1043
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,839
you want to present it in a way that

1044
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,720
they

1045
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,400
they can follow because it's not often

1046
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
the reports given to a techie

1047
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
it could just be the reports provided to

1048
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,040
execs and they need to be able to follow

1049
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,119
at some sort of level and then go do you

1050
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,720
know what give it to my t team and they

1051
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,640
can follow it so you need to get that

1052
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
balance between technical and

1053
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,880
non-technical rights so everyone can

1054
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,839
understand what

1055
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,359
is perfect that's fine to answer your

1056
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,720
question yeah yeah perfect no worries

1057
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,960
uh what proportion of your time would

1058
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,040
you say

1059
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,279
so

1060
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
a pop portion you're looking at around

1061
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,960
20 of the time is given to reporting so

1062
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
you want to improperly invest time into

1063
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
those reports as as you see as i

1064
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,960
mentioned it's the deliverable that's

1065
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,359
given to the customer and it's what

1066
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,040
they're paying for so you want it to be

1067
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,119
a good document it's not just giving

1068
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,280
straight to them as well i must add it

1069
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,720
it goes through a quality assurance

1070
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
process whereby it has another tester

1071
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
set of eyes on it as well and they can

1072
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,720
be like no this isn't right or yes that

1073
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,040
is right

1074
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,399
[Music]

1075
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,619
[Music]

1076
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,359
so we would try to ask questions to get

1077
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,640
the customer to give us the right

1078
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
information obviously as a tester we

1079
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,560
don't know their complete environment we

1080
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,480
can only try to get the information from

1081
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
them

1082
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
ultimately it's about knowing how to ask

1083
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,480
the customer a question and get the

1084
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,520
correct

1085
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,760
information from them and provide it to

1086
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
you and then you can then off the back

1087
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
of what they've told you or often after

1088
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
you ask a question you ask the question

1089
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,640
to them they come back with some

1090
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,480
information and then that allows you to

1091
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,839
then start filling in the gaps that

1092
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,520
they've told you and ask them more off

1093
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,560
the back of it so

1094
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,240
your question asked how often does it

1095
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,960
can be given it varies because it just

1096
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,000
depends on what the customer tells you

1097
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
yes

1098
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,480
when you're doing free testing to the

1099
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
client yes you're introducing to it

1100
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,839
that tester has to pay on to someone

1101
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,160
else yes does that mean that you have

1102
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,319
testers you're specifically there to

1103
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,560
introduce the client to the test

1104
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
beforehand or if does everyone sort of

1105
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,000
take a better process

1106
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,880
so

1107
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,200
the process can be taken by one person

1108
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,040
all the way along or it can just

1109
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,720
typically the process is taken all the

1110
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
way along by one person it's not often

1111
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,319
once you've spoke to a client it's been

1112
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,920
passed off to someone else because

1113
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,839
they're used to your face and then

1114
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,760
you've kind of created this rapport with

1115
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,400
them and they start getting to recognize

1116
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,000
what you're you're saying design so yeah

1117
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,119
i said i hadn't

1118
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,960
i think it's inevitable as you test

1119
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
you're going to knock stuff over it's

1120
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,800
how you communicate with the client that

1121
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,240
has been knocked over as an important

1122
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
part you don't want to hide it from them

1123
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
you want to go back and say i knocked

1124
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,760
over between this period and this period

1125
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,520
i thought i was doing this could you

1126
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,160
check your logs to do this again it's

1127
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,800
just engaging with them and making sure

1128
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
that they know that you've knocked over

1129
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,079
so they don't go back to the logs in

1130
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,359
like

1131
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,079
10 weeks time and

1132
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,760
and say the same is over

1133
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,589
[Music]

1134
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,800
so

1135
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
if it was a five-day engagement we would

1136
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,200
work solely on that test for five days

1137
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,520
it wouldn't be juggling between things

1138
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,440
uh at least that's how we work at quorum

1139
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,040
cyber is if you're on engagement for

1140
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,720
five days you're on that engagement for

1141
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,118
five days and your sole focus is

1142
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,400
[Music]

1143
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,080
sorry i'm still going to hear you

1144
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,259
[Music]

1145
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,520
no so that's a perfectly fine so i just

1146
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,319
get the microphone over here the person

1147
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,839
was asking if i do a pen test and

1148
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,400
nothing's found is that a bad thing so

1149
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
no it's not a bad thing it just showed

1150
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,720
demonstrates that they have a mature

1151
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,119
approach to security and

1152
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,040
they are in the exact place where they

1153
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,560
think they should be

1154
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,880
it's not often that does happen however

1155
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
it can

1156
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,920
happen by any chance

1157
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,520
so we're all humans everyone everyone

1158
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,400
does make mistakes it's how you remove

1159
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,880
how you go about resolving the mistakes

1160
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,560
and i think

1161
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,760
customers is very rare we do miss stuff

1162
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,839
but as i'm saying we are humans and it

1163
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,480
can happen

1164
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,560
perfect

1165
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,960
i think that's all the questions

1166
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
so thank you all for coming and thank

1167
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,800
you for the hacksaw for organizing

1168
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
