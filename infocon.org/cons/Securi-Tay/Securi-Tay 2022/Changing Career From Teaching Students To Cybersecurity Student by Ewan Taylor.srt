1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,799
i'm going to be speaking about what it's

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,279
like to change from one career into

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,800
cyber security

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,719
this will be it'll be relevant to

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
anybody who's not a teacher but many of

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,360
the examples i'll go over will be

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,279
teaching specific because anybody who

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,400
knows me

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
knows i speak about my old job perhaps a

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
bit too much it's kind of ingrained in

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
my head i can see some nodding from

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,439
people there

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
so

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
i shall i'm going to start off with who

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
am i actually

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
so i'm yoon taylor as

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
introduced there i've been a teacher for

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,120
the past five years

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
and

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
through a multitude of reasons i've

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
decided now's the time to come into

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,760
cyber

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
and

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
as a little overview of what i'm doing

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
today

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
i'm going to tell you why i switched i'm

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
going to say why teachers and other

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
career shifters are very suitable for

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
cyber security so then this also

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
transfers to why i think how i think

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,160
cyber security people should

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,800
actually maybe target career changers

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
and teachers particularly because we've

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
got a lot of attributes i'll go over

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
that make us

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
i i dare suggest very successful

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,520
i'll be reflecting upon what first year

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,439
is like studying cyber security what

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,720
that looks like

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,799
uh because

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,119
for somebody who's brand new to this

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
no prior experience at all it can be

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
quite daunting

44
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
and it's this has been filmed as well

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
so that people who are considering cyber

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
security i want them to use this as a a

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
guide so i'm going to give a little bit

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,880
more insight about why i think these

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
people should do cyber and hopefully

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,040
that makes them either decide cyber's a

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
good place to go or

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
actually i'm not going to do it so

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
hopefully i give somebody a little bit

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
more information

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,439
and of course at the end there is a

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
chance for you to pep with me with

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
questions or not people with questions

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
and any ideas or suggestions of what you

59
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
think i should do next so why have i

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,159
left teaching

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,640
despite it being an extremely rewarding

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
profession at times it doesn't feel like

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
a job i have dressed up as an elephant

64
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,840
in front of a whole school of 700 kids

65
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,919
and being paid for it which

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
not many people can say that

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
but as i put here there's bigger class

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360
sizes there's less funding there's less

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
staff there's not as many training

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
opportunities so it's i wanted a change

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
because things were not getting better

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
so i thought

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
still at a relatively young age i'm

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
going to go for a bit of a change into

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
cyber security

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
and yeah balancing the needs of 33

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
people is really tricky balancing

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
fitness for the adults is tricky if you

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
are a parent if you have a nephew a

80
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
niece or a younger brother or sister

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
sometimes just managing one person is

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,319
difficult so 33 is

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,840
almost an apocalypse-like scenario

84
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
i am by no means

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,120
alone in this in scotland scotland loses

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
a lot of its teachers has this england

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
that will go over in the next slide as

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
well i am one of the 33

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
of people that leave after five years

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
exactly the amount of time that i was in

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,879
there

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
for teaching and

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
within two years as well it's about

94
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
twenty percent of people that leave

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,319
after two years within scotland as well

96
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,319
we see here that from four to six

97
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
percent roughly are the amount of

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,319
teachers that leave every year there's

99
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,920
no statistics

100
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
further than 2020 because covet has

101
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
skewed it quite a lot because a lot of

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
people have come back into the

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
profession so there's a lot of potential

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
and a lot of potential people for cyber

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
security to employ here

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,799
you think this is happening absolutely

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
every single year but also

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
many people who enter teaching

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
are entering from another profession as

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
well especially if they're from the pgde

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
roots so that's when you can do a

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
one-year course that fast-tracks you to

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
becoming a teacher but to do that you

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
need to degree in something else so not

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
only are you getting a teacher in that

116
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
scenario you're getting somebody like

117
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
myself that's got experience of doing

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
another degree and another whole skill

119
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,319
set along with that

120
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
so here's a visit for england as well a

121
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
20 lead within two years

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,680
uh they lose just under or roughly 10

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
percent of their teachers a year i

124
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
couldn't find any statistics closer in

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
2018

126
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
but if you just look at michael golf who

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358
became uh who's getting a knighthood

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,918
he's becoming a certainty for doing a

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
a less than good job some people would

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
say that the picture's not getting any

131
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
better so i can't see these statistics

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
changing radically

133
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
so why have i chosen cyber security it's

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
an industry where your interests can go

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,280
anywhere

136
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,759
it's a wide-ranging field which is both

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
a benefit and

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
kind of a curse as well is when you're

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
speaking to people today and they ask

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,040
you what are you interested in

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,479
everything's not always the greatest

142
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
answer you want to find a niche but at

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
the start everything is fascinating

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,479
it's flexible work

145
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
i can work in different places around

146
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
the world i can have different types of

147
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
jobs with my skill set whereas if you're

148
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
a teacher

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
you are a teacher

150
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,039
there's no

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,240
getting around it there you can maybe

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
teach in one school or another school

153
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,199
but within cyber security there's a

154
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
whole host of roles that through

155
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
university you should be prepared to go

156
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
into

157
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
and put here as well at the bottom i can

158
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
transfer my skills that i've used there

159
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
it feels very critical otherwise people

160
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,560
aren't going to want teachers if we

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
can't transfer our skills

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
so what do i have to offer what do

163
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
career changers have to offer what do

164
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,759
teachers have to offer this

165
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,440
this feels very strange because i'm

166
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
going to be picking up myself here a lot

167
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
and

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
as brits we absolutely detest doing that

169
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
okay we hate selling ourselves it's oh

170
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
yeah but

171
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
here is why i think teachers and myself

172
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
are very good within cyber security

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we are very good at collaborating we

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
have to work alongside social workers

175
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,639
parents children themselves our

176
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
management team to ensure we get the

177
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,479
best outcomes for every single child

178
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,759
that we teach

179
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
it's perhaps the easiest to work

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
alongside children and have a good

181
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
partnership than it can be with the

182
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,840
other ones there

183
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
they were not able to get away with

184
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
mistakes because kids are brutal

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
kids do not let you away with a single

186
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
mistake they point everything out i've

187
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,039
had primary one kids and the first thing

188
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
come up and say is mr taylor you're bald

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
straight away no no messing no nothing

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
so and it's the same with computing if

191
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
you go on and you're doing anything

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
within cyber security one mistake is

193
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
critical one mistake can be a security

194
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
flaw one mistake can be a compiler

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
telling you no not happening which is

196
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
incredibly frustrating

197
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
we've got a good attention to detail we

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,919
proofread all the time we're constantly

199
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
scanning rooms we're trying to see who's

200
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,280
going to be misbehaving we're seeing

201
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
who's playing up there whereas

202
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
constantly checking and scanning but

203
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
we're also looking at kids work all the

204
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
time very used to finding mistakes

205
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
spotting them and correcting them which

206
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
is a very important skill within cyber

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
security as well

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
we have to be adaptable too we're not

209
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,800
allowed to just say well this worked

210
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,479
last time we're going to keep doing it

211
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
because children change

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
computing changes at our rapid pace so

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
we have to just and

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,199
basically we go along the lines of what

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
we know now may never be good

216
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
next week might not even be good in a

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
month's time but constantly thinking we

218
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
have to change because it could be you

219
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
turn up to work one day five people are

220
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
off everything you do has to change

221
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,840
and when you're working in a school

222
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,720
environment the kids don't care if

223
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,639
people are off you have to just on the

224
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
fly adapt a lesson for something else if

225
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
you're outside doing pe and suddenly it

226
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,800
starts thundering down with rain you've

227
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
got to make a change there and then

228
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
which can be tricky but it is necessary

229
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
and it's a good skill to have coming

230
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
into cyber security

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
and we also maybe not the most glamorous

232
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
side of the industry we write loads of

233
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
reports those skills will be still well

234
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
used within cyber security

235
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
we maybe don't always necessarily enjoy

236
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,479
doing them but

237
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
it's something that's ingrained in their

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,919
experience that

239
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
we have communication cells as well we

240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
need to break down

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,400
complicated concepts and simplify them

242
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
so that children can understand

243
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
sometimes we need to simplify them so

244
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
parents can understand we have to

245
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
sometimes justify what we do in the

246
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
classroom to tell social workers

247
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
this is why this child needs extra

248
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
support for such and such so what we

249
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
communicate is of the utmost

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
and then that ties into this part here

251
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
working with sensitive data children's

252
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
data is

253
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
absolutely fundamentally important we

254
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
can't compromise that we have we're

255
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
trusted with facts about families

256
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,320
facts about children themselves that we

257
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
have to keep secret we are sworn to do

258
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
so when we graduate as teachers as part

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
of our professional code of conduct so

260
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,640
we bring that experience to cyber

261
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
security we can say well actually i've

262
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
worked with private and sensitive data

263
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,959
and i've been trusted with it

264
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
and we are

265
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
ever so slightly control freaks we are

266
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
very organized which is brilliant but

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,279
also

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,360
maybe frustrating for other people that

269
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
have to live with teachers or work

270
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
alongside them because we are

271
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
we love organization we hate it at the

272
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
start when we go into teaching but we

273
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
realize the advantages it brings and it

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
becomes ingrained into you anybody

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
that's seen me on my course it's

276
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
ridiculous the level i schedule things

277
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
and organize things but these are skills

278
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
that we bring that are naturally set in

279
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
our brains now

280
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,519
and

281
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
we have patients and we've got in

282
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
abundance

283
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
you can't be a teacher if you're not

284
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
patient i dare suggest you can't work in

285
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
cyber security if you're not patient

286
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,880
things will go wrong things will take

287
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
ages to load things will break and you

288
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
just sometimes have to

289
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,720
get through it just with a bit of

290
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,279
patience there's no

291
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,839
no other way of doing it

292
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,000
sometimes so what has it been like

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
going into a new industry and it has

294
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
been very very difficult okay

295
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,200
we go we come from an industry where we

296
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
were skilled at something and then

297
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
defined new things all the time in cyber

298
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
security that are difficult

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
to master and pick up can be really

300
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,959
frustrating

301
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,320
so

302
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
it's and it's not the case that you can

303
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
get away with a little mistake either

304
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,839
it's brutal it's the if you try to build

305
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,920
something that we've been doing using c

306
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
plus one error doesn't work or one error

307
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
and it doesn't work properly which can

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
be even more frustrating

309
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,880
so coming from it coming from expertise

310
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
down to that level can be frustrating

311
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
initially and we also

312
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
if you're not within a computing field

313
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
i'm sure everybody in this room has been

314
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
told this oh you're good with computers

315
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
or crc you in well he's brilliant with

316
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
computers he'll fix that you become in

317
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
another industry being skilled at

318
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
computers is totally different to when

319
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,079
you're here and you're told actually

320
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
i've got so much to learn i am

321
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
way behind what the industry needs right

322
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
now

323
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,160
so

324
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
that's what i realized very quickly

325
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
within cyber security is that you're

326
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
told by family and by ex colleagues

327
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,920
you're really good at computing or you'd

328
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
be brilliant on a cyber security course

329
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
not so much the case that other people's

330
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
expertise are

331
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
about your expertise are not exactly

332
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
accurate

333
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
so what i've been studying so far

334
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,519
apologies if you are an advertised

335
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
student especially if you're in first

336
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,160
year because this is just reminding you

337
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
of everything you've probably still got

338
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
to study or do right now

339
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,640
but

340
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
here are a whole host of concepts if you

341
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
are thinking and studying cyber security

342
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
you're going to encounter this also will

343
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
apply to ethical hacking as well it's an

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
average uni in first year our courses

345
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,959
are identical for the first year because

346
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,240
we have to

347
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
build up our foundational knowledge of

348
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
how computing security works how

349
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
networks function and how to program how

350
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
to develop basic concepts of the

351
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
starting programs but it will quickly

352
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
scale up but we can't

353
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
we can't run before we can walk

354
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,800
now if you are brand new to

355
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
cybersecurity that is tricky as i put at

356
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
the bottom here there's lots of jargon

357
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
to get to grips with

358
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
if you are coming from it straight at

359
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
the school it may be easier because you

360
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
may have done computing science at

361
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,720
higher or advanced higher you might be

362
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
coming from college where you have that

363
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
extra advantage but i'm speaking to

364
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,360
somebody who is coming in cold with no

365
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
prior experience i had never quoted a

366
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
day in my life before i started so the

367
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,200
first thing i ever ordered was in the

368
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,839
first day uni hello worlds that was that

369
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
was how basic i was at the start

370
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
so here is a flavor of what it's some of

371
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,600
the jargon i've encountered and i've put

372
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,399
on the right hand side what this is like

373
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,440
for

374
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
for me so you might be looking at it as

375
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,720
experts or close to experts going i know

376
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
what everything on the left stands for

377
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,639
but what that looked like to me at the

378
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
start is what the picture to the right

379
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
hand side looks like i've also while i

380
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
speak a little bit

381
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,399
uh there'll be a bonus point if you can

382
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
work at the language that this is

383
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
written in and the book that is from is

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
one

385
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
big kind of hint there but

386
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
this is what it is like when we start

387
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,800
brand new there we pick a little bits

388
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
that we can recognize but

389
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,959
it's a lot a lot of it is just

390
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,880
be gobbledygook at the start and because

391
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
you can't you can maybe get portions off

392
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
it you think yes but it can be so

393
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
frustrating because you want to just get

394
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
head in

395
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,519
you want to go as deep as you can

396
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,959
straight away and start running with it

397
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
you can't it's so frustrating

398
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
of interest is there anybody who's

399
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
worked out the language suspects in

400
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,880
or is anybody who maybe gets the book

401
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
that it is

402
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
it says it's scandinavians close

403
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
do i have any advance on scandinavian

404
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
okay i can reveal to you it is in

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
icelandic

406
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
and it is actually the godfather

407
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
and there is i think on the third line

408
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
in italics it says don corleone which is

409
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
probably the biggest hint that there was

410
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
but if you're looking at that and i know

411
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
it's probably hard to see properly from

412
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
where you are but that is what it is

413
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,279
like when you're coming brand new into

414
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
cyber security going well it's just a

415
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,199
complete different language and that's

416
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,880
before you even get to the multitude of

417
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,639
languages that people have different

418
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,079
opinions on whether you should learn it

419
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,639
first or second or whenever

420
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
so the challenges are

421
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,160
that

422
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
something you learn in one bit often

423
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
ties in with another area of cyber

424
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
security so if you don't get one thing

425
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
it can be really frustrating because

426
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,079
when you're coming into as a career

427
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
changer you want to make sure you're

428
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
making a success of it so you that is

429
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
such an easy temptation just to run

430
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
straight away with it and jump ahead you

431
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
have to slow down and make sure that

432
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
you're understanding everything

433
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,440
otherwise you just you do get

434
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
overwhelmed there are many times when

435
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
you sit down you think i can't do this

436
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,959
but actually if you break it down you

437
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
slowly will be able to do some of it

438
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,560
then most of it then hopefully all of

439
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
them

440
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
and i've said this several times before

441
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
it's frustrating when you come in from a

442
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
skilled viewpoint as well because i'm

443
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
thinking of nobody else in this class

444
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
would be able to teach 33 kids and

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
manage all of them for a whole year but

446
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,320
here i am struggling how to code this

447
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
because i've not put a semicolon at the

448
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,880
end it could be so frustrating for that

449
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
reverse

450
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
so my advice is for people who are doing

451
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
cyber security is be aware that this

452
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,079
will happen but kind of embrace it and

453
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,240
there's been something i do later on

454
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,519
that people in my course will be able to

455
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
vouch for a million percent that shows

456
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
how i've managed to navigate this

457
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
struggle

458
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
and as well you will be told as i when

459
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,839
i've looked at any cyber security

460
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
courses they'll say experience is not

461
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
experience isn't needed

462
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
not required so you start to think all

463
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
right this might be quite easy then but

464
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
that is by no means the case

465
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,680
it's

466
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,240
what you'll learn within cyber security

467
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
other industries i've been in via retail

468
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
via musical uh work via a teacher these

469
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
skills are completely alien they're

470
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
they're brilliant skills to have within

471
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
coding programming debugging

472
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,079
networking skills but you don't use them

473
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
anywhere else they are so specific to

474
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,800
this industry that you can't pick them

475
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,160
up otherwise

476
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
i'm trying to put here

477
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
it's not the action thriller that many

478
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
people might think this job is i'm not

479
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
on a movie set

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,880
you know

481
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
basically telling

482
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
destroying russia's whole attack by on

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
ukraine by being some magical cyber

484
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
security person though it's exhibit me

485
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,959
spending hours with visual studio uh

486
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
hating a compiler and loving it when it

487
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,720
works they're absolutely hating it again

488
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
and then getting used to one

489
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,480
feature within c plus plus and then your

490
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
lecture says oh go and do this and then

491
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,519
suddenly you're right back to the bottom

492
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,480
again

493
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,639
so yeah by no means is it the glamorous

494
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,199
profession but it is still absolutely

495
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,639
fascinating and there are so many

496
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,360
opportunities that your interests there

497
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
will be a role within cyber security for

498
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,480
something you're interested in that

499
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,199
could be football it could be politics

500
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
it could be something to do with the

501
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,040
military there's so many different

502
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
avenues you can go down

503
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
so what have i done to navigate these

504
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,680
challenges these are the

505
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,439
these are the steps i would recommend

506
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
anybody to take if they are

507
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
studying cyber security

508
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,679
the first one is people in my course

509
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,959
will be able to vouch for i ask so many

510
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
questions it is ridiculous

511
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,799
teachers all love to send their own

512
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,559
voice as you can all tell by me doing a

513
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,880
speech right now but we ask

514
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
loads of questions we want kids to ask

515
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
questions no i'm in a scenario to

516
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
absolutely

517
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
frustrate my lectures with the amount of

518
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,760
questions i ask but they've only got our

519
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
three and a half years left so that'll

520
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
be nice uh practice practice practice i

521
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
learned through iteration i it's the

522
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,679
most frustrating way to learn i think

523
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
it's probably the best way to learn it's

524
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
about sitting down trying to work

525
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,360
something out finding error messages

526
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
googling what the error messages

527
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
actually mean then getting really

528
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
confused because in stack overflow it

529
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
makes no sense sometimes why an error

530
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
message happened and then going back and

531
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,240
then just working it out very

532
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,120
minutiae tiny bit bit by bit

533
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
but as one lecturer says here it's good

534
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
for the soul to do it this way so

535
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
my soul must be feeling really good

536
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
right now i've created the blog

537
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,799
so i've been documenting what it's like

538
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,559
being a student third time around being

539
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
a student when you are almost 30 how

540
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
that differs to being a student when

541
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
you're in your late teens or your early

542
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,200
20s

543
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
and that's where i'll be uploading

544
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
computing based lesson plans for primary

545
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
school teachers so i know that primary

546
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
school teachers have no free time so if

547
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
i can at least give them less than plans

548
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,679
they can just pick up a new straight

549
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
away that'll hopefully have a good

550
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
impact for some children in scotland

551
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,039
and i've also joined the hacking society

552
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,400
through the hacking society i was able

553
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
to speak today but

554
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
i can't recommend highly enough getting

555
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
a group of like-minded like-minded

556
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,799
people who you can ask for help or who

557
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,559
you can work alongside to learn things

558
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,640
from i would say preferably in person

559
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,039
online forums can be brilliant but i

560
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,720
offend them that

561
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
they don't fully understand where you

562
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
are if you are a beginner and it they

563
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
can quickly it can become really

564
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
daunting for you but if it's in person i

565
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,480
feel like it's

566
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
more

567
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
efficacious if that's the best word to

568
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
use there it gives you a more beneficial

569
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,120
result so i can't recommend highly

570
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,039
enough having a community of people that

571
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
you trust to be able to say i'm really

572
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
not getting this or i've and i have a

573
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,799
big interest in doing this but i don't

574
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
even know where to get started would you

575
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
be able to help me get started would you

576
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
know for who i can speak to is this even

577
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
a good idea is this feasible because

578
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
sometimes we have ideas as first year

579
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,080
students that are actually

580
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
they're not even worth getting started

581
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
yet

582
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,080
so i want to give you a flavor of what

583
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,679
it's like entering a profession with

584
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
loads of acronyms okay

585
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
now these are all acronyms i use in my

586
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
old job so

587
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,400
i do know them all but i want to see how

588
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,799
many you get some will be guessable but

589
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
some maybe complete goldy group so i'll

590
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,919
put it up there for

591
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,679
about a minute or so

592
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,440
so i have

593
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,480
here 32 different acronyms some may make

594
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
sense the answers are all on the next

595
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
slide as well i'm not just going to

596
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
leave you on a big cliffhanger that

597
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
would be horrible

598
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
but these are all things i use every day

599
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
and it's by no means a slight on cyber

600
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
security but when you are in a

601
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,960
profession and you're working with

602
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
people in that profession you begin to

603
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
talk in acronyms you begin to shorten

604
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
things you some you have a assumed level

605
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
of knowledge because that is generally

606
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,640
what happens but when you are new into

607
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
a new field and you hear everybody

608
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,640
speaking this language it's a bit scary

609
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,919
so

610
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
does anybody think they could name ten

611
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,960
or more of these

612
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
no but

613
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,639
five

614
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,240
i think that there's some there i

615
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
definitely think would be guessable that

616
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,679
you've seen but i'll put you of your

617
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,960
misery

618
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
okay if you can see that hopefully there

619
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
but these are all

620
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
from my time in teaching if i've had to

621
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,159
use every acronym on here whether it has

622
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:56,960
been

623
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
on reports whether it's been social work

624
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
whether it's just been in general

625
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
some are perhaps more serious than

626
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
others some are completely more

627
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
gobbledygook than others

628
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
but i'm sure some people may have heard

629
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,200
of adhd and add they're probably more

630
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
well known there

631
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,280
but when it comes to shinari which is of

632
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
course self

633
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,679
safe healthy achieving uh

634
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,520
nurturing

635
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
gotta get this right um respected

636
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
responsible and included

637
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
that's as that was a school specific one

638
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
to where i was last time

639
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,640
so i'll make sure that person gets i

640
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
love the flow there

641
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,760
that is my talk there now if anybody has

642
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,720
any questions feel free but maybe more

643
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
importantly

644
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
what advice or suggestions would you

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,240
have for some somebody

646
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
starting off to

647
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
make sure that their studies are as

648
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
successful as possible so

649
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
i will leave the floor open to all of

650
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,559
