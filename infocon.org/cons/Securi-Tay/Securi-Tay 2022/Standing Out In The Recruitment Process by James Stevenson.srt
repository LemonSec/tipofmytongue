1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,639
hey everyone first of all thanks all for

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,319
coming along and thanks the organizers

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,000
for having me here today this talk's

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,520
gonna be a bit different for me for a

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,760
few reasons uh first of all obviously

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
i'm not there in person uh and this is

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
the first time i've done almost a hybrid

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,239
talk where you're there at security and

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
i'm here kind of previously recording

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
from my office um this is also going to

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
be a bit different for me because this

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
is the first time i'm moving away from

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,320
technical talks you know in the past

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,480
i've spoken about building security

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
operation centers i've talked about

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
offender profiling about identifying and

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
predicting cyber criminals but today

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
we're going to be focusing more on

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,680
competencies and soft skills and things

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,079
like recruitment and training

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,440
so i'm really interested in if anyone

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
has any feedback and feel free to reach

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
out to me on twitter as well if you just

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
want to talk about the presentation

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
so this was the kind of original title i

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
had for this talk and it was going to

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
focus on

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,879
training i developed it interrupt labs

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,840
it was going to talk about kind of the

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
recruitment process i've been a part of

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,239
but in all honesty after i developed the

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
talk it was it was pretty garbage right

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
and it it primarily was pretty garbage

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
for a few reasons but it felt quite

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
cooperative and it felt like it really

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
didn't help anyone it was more kind of

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
just a case study rather than actually

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,600
kind of anything useful

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,759
so i've changed the talk up a bit

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,200
and i've called it standing out in the

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
recruitment process and what we're going

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,560
to do is we're going to cover a few

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
things we're going to cover how we can

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
stand out in the recruitment process and

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
how we can use

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
self-development how we can use things

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,119
we've done like training to do that

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,320
and if you are like super interested in

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,439
the training that i've developed

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,640
previously or the training that we have

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,720
at interrupt labs feel free to reach out

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
and i can definitely talk to you about

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
that but primarily what we're going to

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,000
focus about today is standing out in the

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
recruitment process

56
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,799
by

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
developing ourselves and you know this

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
can apply kind of across your career so

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
if we're moving into computer security

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
if we're changing field in computer

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
security you know all of this applies

62
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
and i really came to this talk idea from

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
two different angles so

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
at interrupt labs my current company

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
i've been supporting interviews i've

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
been supporting cv sifts and kind of the

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,840
general recruitment process as well as

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
developing training at the company

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
and the second angle i came up this talk

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,200
from was gosh i want to say around about

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,280
three years ago now um i spoke at a

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
panel with a bunch of my friends khloe

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
brett dan and jack

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,599
and in that panel we were talking about

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,840
entering the computer security industry

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
our experiences entering the industry

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
and how we recommended other people do

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
it as well

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
and one thing that kept coming up in

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
that talk was this question

81
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
how can we stand out in the recruitment

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,879
process

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
and that's kind of really where i'm

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
coming at this talk from it's looking at

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
how we can stand out in the recruitment

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
process

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
we've also my experience now of you know

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,920
running interviews and doing cv sifts

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
and

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
all of that's going to have this kind of

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
backbone of

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
training but also self-development and

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
kind of how we can stand out and how we

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
can demonstrate an interest in what

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
we're applying for

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
so before we start who am i well my name

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
is james stevenson and this time i want

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
to say around about six years ago now i

99
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,680
graduated from the university of south

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
wales studying computer security before

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that i was an intern at alert logic a

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
cloud security company and since then

103
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,879
i've been a software engineer at bt i've

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
been an offensive security researcher at

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,680
f-secure and these days i work as a

106
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
vulnerability researcher at interpla

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
apps

108
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
interrupt labs kind of officially formed

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
in december we're a start-up of around

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
about 20 or so people and we primarily

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
focus in vulnerability research so

112
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
that's everything from

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
ios to android to embedded systems

114
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
malware you know and everything in

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
between

116
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
so if you're interested in

117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,400
either reaching out to me at the end of

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
the talk you can definitely reach out to

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
me on twitter but if you're interested

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
in learning more about interrupt labs

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
the training we do at interrupt labs

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
anything like that um

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
my friend and colleague declan should be

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
in the audience uh we'll see but if he's

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
not you can definitely find him

126
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
throughout the conference and he'll be

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,478
around you can feel free to ask him any

128
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,160
questions either about the talk or about

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
interpretables

130
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
so what are we actually going to be

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
talking about today well i've broken it

132
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
down into a handful of sections

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
um what we've talked about so far is you

134
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
know a general introduction i've talked

135
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
about the talk and i've talked about

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
kind of the motivation behind the talk

137
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,680
but what i want to do for the rest of

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
today is i want to break it down into

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,440
three main areas and i want to talk

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
about how we can

141
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
be unique in the recruitment process and

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
how we can stand out in the recruitment

143
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
process and i want to do that in three

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,360
different levels so first of all i want

145
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
to talk about how we can do that at

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,479
almost a generic level

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
so whether or not you're interested in

148
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
red teaming blue teaming if not you're

149
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
interested in becoming an architect you

150
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
know there are these core principles and

151
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
these fundamentals that we can apply and

152
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,199
recruiters look for during that process

153
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
and then gonna specifically focus on

154
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
vulnerability research you know skills

155
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
and techniques and evidencing that that

156
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
we look for during the vulnerability

157
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
researcher almost recruitment process

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
whether or not that's a junior role or

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,199
higher

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
and then finally i want to talk about

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
specialization you know we get a lot of

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,720
cvs in or questions about

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
whether or not people should specialize

164
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
in a specific area before they come to

165
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
us and i really want to talk about that

166
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,199
and kind of my views on where people sit

167
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,639
there

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,440
so

169
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
i normally like to start talks off with

170
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,240
a question or a quote and the one i came

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
up with for today is this

172
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
and what this quote is saying is it's

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
all about learning by doing

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
and we're really looking for two things

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
when we look at junior rules adding

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
triple abs you know we're looking for

177
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
that people have the ability to learn

178
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,280
and that they have a passion in the area

179
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
that they are applying for so you know

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,319
they're really passionate about

181
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,080
vulnerability research

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,319
and when we're looking at a cv or when

183
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,759
we're an interview

184
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
it's really hard to kind of find

185
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,720
evidence for those things so when we

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
look for people that stand out we're

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
looking for people that can demonstrate

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
that passion and that can show that

189
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
ability to learn

190
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,360
now this talk isn't going to be you know

191
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
how to make the perfect cv but i thought

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
having kind of two examples here was

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
really useful we've got jane doe on the

194
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,759
left and we've got alice on the right

195
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,240
in jane doe's cv we can see that she

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,479
specifies okay i'm really passionate

197
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
about vulnerability research i'm really

198
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
interested in reverse engineering

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,039
but in alice's cv she says the same

200
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
things but also demonstrates that gives

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,440
examples

202
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,240
of you know reverse engineering firmware

203
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
of performing reverse engineering ctfs

204
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
and kind of at a very high level

205
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
that's one of the things that we're

206
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,639
looking for one of the things that will

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
help you stand out is by demonstrating

208
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,560
those passions is by showing not only

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
that you

210
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
are interested in the area but you have

211
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
the ability to learn and you've kind of

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
done things outside of

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
what was set out for you

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
so what i want to do next is i want to

215
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,919
start diving into kind of these

216
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
fundamentals that i mentioned and those

217
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,800
fundamentals are things that as i said

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
can be applied across industry so

219
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,560
whether or not you're looking at going

220
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,800
into red teaming blue teaming i said

221
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
whether or not you're looking to go into

222
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
a completely different field altogether

223
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
these are kind of principles or

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
fundamentals that we'd look for kind of

225
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
in all cvs right and one of the first

226
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
things we look for is to be

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,599
almost goal oriented or at least making

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,560
sure that you have a goal and as i said

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
the original time when i did this talk

230
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,039
it was all about training and how you

231
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
could use training to

232
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
develop yourself and kind of better

233
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
yourself in that regard and i've moved

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
away from that for the kind of this

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
version of the talk but we can take a

236
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,199
few kind of similarities between it

237
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,560
because there are quite a few different

238
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
ways that we can make ourselves unique

239
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
in the interview process

240
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
and you know at a very high level we've

241
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,840
got almost an analytical approach and an

242
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
intuitive approach in that analytical

243
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
approach maybe we

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
set kind of a very specific goal maybe

245
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
we use some models to achieve that goal

246
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
maybe we use scheduling

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
while kind of that intuitive approach

248
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
maybe we have a mentor

249
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
maybe we try a lot of different things

250
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
out and we kind of play around with

251
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
things as we go and neither of those are

252
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
right or wrong

253
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
and i'll give a few examples of some

254
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
analytical and intuitive approaches as

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
we continue

256
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
but what's really important there is

257
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
just that goal part right whether or not

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
you're analytical or intuitive what's

259
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
really important is having that end goal

260
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,839
and kind of demonstrating at least how

261
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
you've tried to get that and again

262
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,200
that's what's really important and

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
really what we're looking for let's say

264
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,880
that you want to be a vulnerability

265
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
researcher in android specifically right

266
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
and let's say you're in your last year

267
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
of university

268
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
you can set that goal for yourself

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
and then throughout that last year of

270
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,399
university you can work towards it so

271
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,279
maybe you can do some ctfs maybe you can

272
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
build some tooling maybe you can play

273
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,560
around with

274
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
vulnerability research on some new and

275
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
emerging technologies

276
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
and then that goal while you might not

277
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
have achieved it you can still

278
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
demonstrate how you try to get that you

279
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,320
can obviously set smaller goals in

280
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,200
between and everything along those lines

281
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
so

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
one thing that we see a lot

283
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
uh in cvs is we see a lot of people

284
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
saying that they are experts in a field

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
and we might get this for for junior

286
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,040
roles you know people saying that

287
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
they're

288
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
proficient in a certain programming

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
language or that they kind of are

290
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
experts a different technology or

291
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
whatever

292
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
and this is kind of where we see people

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
in the i know everything field

294
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
and what we're really looking for in

295
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
conjunction to that kind of goal setting

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,079
is that people identify weaknesses you

297
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
know maybe saying okay i'm actually not

298
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
too good at this programming language or

299
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
you know i'm not too good at this kind

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
of approach and then having that goal

301
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,200
and then trying to remediate that almost

302
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,279
and then demonstrating how they did that

303
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,560
so people would be able to say you know

304
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,600
okay well

305
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
i identified actually wasn't really good

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
at writing python

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
so i then

308
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
had a look at how i could be better at

309
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
it and i decided okay i'd do some

310
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
pluralsight training i'd make some

311
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
tooling and kind of so on and then so we

312
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,040
can see actually that journey we can see

313
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
how someone went from thinking they knew

314
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,920
everything to actually not knowing

315
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
that uh how to use this programming

316
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,519
language and then we can see the journey

317
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
moving forward of how they developed on

318
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
that and how that they built those

319
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,399
skills

320
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
and how they've demonstrated that as

321
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
well

322
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
the last thing i wanted to talk about in

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
the kind of fundamental section that i

324
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,959
think applies to all industries is

325
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
mentoring right i think mentoring is so

326
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
important you know i've been really

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,200
lucky to have several mentors during my

328
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
career in computer security

329
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,760
and when we look at mentors i think it's

330
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,600
really useful to

331
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
be able to talk to someone who's one or

332
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
two years on from where you want to be

333
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
in your career so if we look at almost

334
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
graduate schemes at organizations i

335
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,920
think these are really useful for

336
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
mentoring right because someone who is

337
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
on the graduate scheme previously is a

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
really good mentor for someone entering

339
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
the scheme currently

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
but you can see this kind of across

341
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
career changing or junior roles or even

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
senior roles as well where it's more of

343
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,639
kind of a give and take as well

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,760
but i just think that's something that's

345
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
really important kind of across field so

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
you know i've worked in software

347
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
engineering i've worked in

348
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,480
pen testing and i've worked in

349
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
vulnerability research and i think all

350
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,519
of those fields benefit from having a

351
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,320
mentor which is kind of really important

352
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
so what i wanted to do next is i wanted

353
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
to move away from these fundamentals

354
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
that kind of apply to all industries and

355
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
specifically talk about vulnerability

356
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
research and skills and techniques and

357
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,839
kind of approaches

358
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,639
that help define you and make you stand

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
out in the recruitment process

360
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
and as i said earlier on that really

361
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,720
comes down to two things right it really

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,279
comes down to

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
defining your passion and demonstrating

364
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
that passion and then also demonstrating

365
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
an ability to learn and learn new skills

366
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,279
because at the end of the day when we

367
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
look at especially junior vulnerability

368
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
researchers

369
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
we're not necessarily looking that you

370
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
know everything under the sun when it

371
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
comes to a specific technology but what

372
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
we are looking for is that you are

373
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
really interested in that technology and

374
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
that you have the ability to learn those

375
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
things about it

376
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
so the first thing that

377
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
i feel is is super important when it

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
comes to vulnerability research and

379
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
making yourself unique and distinct in

380
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,120
vulnerability research is having a few

381
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
non-technical traits you know so that's

382
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
everything from creativity perseverance

383
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
curiosity

384
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,079
and at the end of the day vulnerability

385
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,079
research is quite hard you know i'm sure

386
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,279
like a bunch of other um specialties in

387
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,360
kind of computer security it is really

388
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
hard uh and that's because we might get

389
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
some really hard targets

390
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,680
that no one has done research on before

391
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
and so you need to spend that time and

392
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
you need to have that curiosity and that

393
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,360
perseverance

394
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,079
so these are kind of some

395
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
non-technical skills and traits that are

396
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
really important but obviously there are

397
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
also technical skills that are important

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
as well and that we can demonstrate

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
throughout that recruitment process you

400
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
know some of the basics are programming

401
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
reverse engineering

402
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
vulnerability classes so understanding

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
the difference between say static

404
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
analysis dynamic analysis but also

405
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
things like buffer overflows memory

406
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
corruption issues everything along those

407
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
lines and these are kind of just a

408
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,000
handful

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
of kind of

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
technical skills that we might look for

411
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
in junior roles but really as i said

412
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
earlier on when it comes to making

413
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,880
yourself unique and distinct we're

414
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,519
really looking for the ability to learn

415
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,959
you don't necessarily need to know all

416
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,519
of these straight up the game

417
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
what i briefly wanted to touch up on

418
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,800
next is this concept of t people and it

419
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,639
will come up again a bit later on but

420
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
the idea of t people

421
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
is that

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
all of our people will have kind of a

423
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
broad understanding of surrounding

424
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
technologies and disciplines so let's

425
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
say we have a vulnerability researcher

426
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
that vulnerability researcher may have a

427
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
broad understanding of different

428
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
programming languages different

429
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
architectures

430
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
a broad understanding of different

431
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
techniques

432
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
and so on and then what they'll have is

433
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
kind of a very specific understanding in

434
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
one area so we might have an android

435
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
specific vulnerability researcher or an

436
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
ios specific vulnerability researcher

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,480
and so on and that's because as i said

438
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
earlier on vulnerability research in

439
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
other fields

440
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
are quite hard right and so

441
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,160
it's impossible for us to specialize in

442
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
everything so instead what we're going

443
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,880
to do is have that broad understanding

444
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
and then specialize in one very specific

445
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,279
thing

446
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,480
and the reason i wanted to talk about

447
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,839
this is because what i want to talk

448
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
about next is the difference between

449
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
structured and unstructured training and

450
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,959
this really comes back to being unique

451
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,480
and standing out in the interview

452
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,440
process

453
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
because you can demonstrate passion and

454
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,000
you can demonstrate the ability to learn

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
in quite a few different ways

456
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
the first way we can do that is with

457
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,639
structured learning right you can say i

458
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,360
did this course i watched this video i

459
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
went to security and watched a talk on

460
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,440
vulnerability research or software

461
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
engineering or red teaming whatever

462
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
and then the second way that we can

463
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
demonstrate all that stuff is with this

464
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
kind of unstructured learning and

465
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,279
that can be things like i developed some

466
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,160
tooling or i researched this new and

467
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
up-and-coming technology

468
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,079
and again i'll talk about this kind of

469
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,959
as we continue but that structured and

470
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
unstructured learning we actually get

471
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
different outcomes from

472
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
when we talk about the structured

473
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
learning we'll actually see that we get

474
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,079
more of those technical skills

475
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,000
and you know we don't necessarily get

476
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
many of those non-technical skills

477
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
because they're quite guided you know

478
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,079
watching a talk at security or watching

479
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,160
a youtube video and fuzzing is going to

480
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
develop those technical skills but it

481
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
won't necessarily develop that curiosity

482
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,959
or that perseverance

483
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,360
while the unstructured training is both

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
going to develop those technical skills

485
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
but because it's quite unstructured by

486
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
its nature then we're going to also

487
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
develop things like perseverance problem

488
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,640
solving curiosity

489
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,199
so if you have examples of unstructured

490
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
training definitely use those

491
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
throughout the recruitment process to

492
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
demonstrate those skills in addition to

493
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
you know having one or two bits of

494
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,679
structured um examples in there as well

495
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,079
so talking about examples i just briefly

496
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,799
wanted to cover one or two

497
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,679
examples for what we have for

498
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
both structured and unstructured

499
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
training so i just put a few examples on

500
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,280
the screen but obviously you know

501
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,799
anything that is covered under this

502
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,880
umbrella accounts but what's really

503
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,919
important is that we have that outcome

504
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
that we have that definition of what

505
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
that training or what that task or that

506
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,480
activity has achieved

507
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
so here we've got you know developing a

508
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
vulnerable chat server reverse

509
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,480
engineering malware running a ctf

510
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
researching an up and coming technology

511
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,600
but for all of these we can demonstrate

512
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
the skills that we've learned as part of

513
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
that you know we've got programming

514
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
we've got problem solving uh what else

515
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,160
do we have we've got perseverance um and

516
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
kind of so on and that's what's really

517
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
important right it's about being able to

518
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
show what you've done but then also

519
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,360
using that to demonstrate what you've

520
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,440
learnt and almost the outcomes of that

521
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
when it comes to structured training and

522
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
i mentioned a few of these a minute ago

523
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
but we've got things like you know

524
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,919
programming tutorials things like

525
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,440
pluralsight

526
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
we've got talks at conferences like

527
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
security uh right to war games um which

528
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
i think is great and it's this online

529
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
platform for um vulnerability research

530
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
and reverse engineering it's quite

531
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,559
expensive it's about 700 pounds and

532
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
that's also a difference that we can see

533
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
in the structured and unstructured

534
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
training right in that unstructured

535
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
training it's just about us going off

536
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
and doing something right normally free

537
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,880
well in the structured training we might

538
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
see a lot of courses we might see

539
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
conferences we might see

540
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
platforms that cost so there is a

541
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,440
difference there as well

542
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
and then as i said a minute ago when we

543
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
look at the structured training the

544
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,080
outcomes are normally going to be more

545
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
technical based so you know maybe we're

546
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
going to develop skills and programming

547
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
skills in vr skills in reverse

548
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
engineering and so on

549
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
and

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
almost the final thing that i wanted to

551
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
talk about today is that final layer is

552
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,039
about specialization

553
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,480
because similar to what i said earlier

554
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
on um it's really important to set goals

555
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
where it's really important to have a

556
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
vision of where you want to be and then

557
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
work towards that you don't necessarily

558
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
need to reach it but at least work

559
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,799
towards it

560
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,880
and that is something that we see a lot

561
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
in the interview process we'll see

562
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,120
people um trying to specialize in an

563
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
area almost too soon

564
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
because similar to what i said a minute

565
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,880
ago vulnerability research and i'm sure

566
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
other fields as well are really hard and

567
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
so especially for junior roles it's

568
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
really important to get the groundwork

569
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
done and get as much kind of

570
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
baseline knowledge as you can before you

571
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
start to specialize

572
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,640
so as part of the interview process you

573
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
know demonstrate that passion

574
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
demonstrate that ability to learn but

575
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,679
you don't necessarily need to

576
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,840
demonstrate that you're a specialist in

577
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
that field

578
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
um when it comes to vulnerability

579
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
research i think i said earlier on but

580
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
you know we can specialize in things

581
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
like android ios embedded systems

582
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
and more and it's really good to have

583
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
one of those as an end goal

584
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,760
but especially as i said in junior

585
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
positions don't worry too much at trying

586
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
to demonstrate that earlier on because

587
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
that's what your job is going to do

588
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,280
that's what your grad scheme is going to

589
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
do that's what your junior role will

590
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,760
help you get towards is that senior role

591
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
and is that specialized role

592
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
but you don't need to have that straight

593
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,840
of the

594
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,919
game so that's that talk basically

595
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
coming to a close

596
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
um i kind of just wanted to wrap up by

597
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
going back to the beginning and

598
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,159
hopefully this talk has been really

599
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
useful hopefully this talk has kind of

600
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
gone through

601
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,679
from the perspective of someone who runs

602
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,919
interviews from someone who reads cvs

603
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,520
someone who develops training and

604
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
someone who was in the same shoes a few

605
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
years ago

606
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,919
but hopefully it's gone through things

607
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,679
that we look for in the interview

608
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
process things that you can do to stand

609
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
out things like showing passion things

610
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
like developing yourself developing

611
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,039
training and so on and then hopefully

612
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,360
it's allowed you to at least start

613
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
thinking about things that you can do to

614
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,240
stand out in that interview process

615
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
um obviously i'm not there right now uh

616
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
but as i said earlier declan is

617
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
hopefully in the crowd somewhere uh so

618
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,000
feel free to reach out to him if you

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
have any questions about the talk any

620
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,240
questions about interrupt labs any

621
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
questions about the recruitment process

622
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,679
as declan has helped on a handful of

623
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,960
interviews as well

624
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,760
um

625
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
so once again thanks all for coming

626
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,880
along and thanks to the organizers for

627
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
having me here i think this is the third

628
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
or fourth security i've spoken at so

629
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,159
it's really good to kind of keep the

630
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
tradition going even if it is a hybrid

631
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,039
at this stage um but once again thanks

632
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,320
all for having me and if you've got any

633
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,520
questions feel free to reach out to

634
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
declan or myself on twitter thanks

635
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
everyone
