1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,200
so thanks for coming along everyone um

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,880
so just to kick off a bit about me i'm

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,480
jamie mcdonald and i'm the head of

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
security at rasa

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,960
um rasa build a conversational ai

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
platform which basically means we build

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
kind of an infrastructure layer that

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
people build chat bots and virtual ai

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
assistants things like that on top of

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,439
um

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,119
so my team works on both the security of

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,359
the organization itself and also

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,960
application security since some of our

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,160
enterprise customers have quite

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,519
stringent requirements for light

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
security and compliance as well

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,040
previously i worked at fortinet and zone

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
fox doing security engineering

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,600
so my talk today is about building a

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
security function at a company and it's

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,840
from the point of view of a kind of

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
hybrid startup with a big engineering

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,640
function

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,399
that builds a product because that's

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
what my background is and it's kind of

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
one of the most challenging places to

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
insert a security culture

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,960
um

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
this is a shameless attempt to warm up

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
the crowd with a picture of cats and my

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
cats before i get into the body of the

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
talk hopefully that works

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,760
so

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
to start with uh we'll take a quick run

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
through the kind of business aspect you

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
need to consider if you're in a role

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
either as the only um

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,799
security person in the business or if

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,240
you're in a role where you're kind of

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,600
the head of security you're starting off

41
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
a team

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
um

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
the business stuff is just as if not

44
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,880
more important than than all the

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
technical stuff because that's what

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,520
keeps you on the right track and keeps

47
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,880
you aligned with what the business

48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,000
actually wants you to be doing

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
and then the second part i'll move on to

50
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
the practical bit so these are actual

51
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
concrete things that you can implement

52
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,840
and kind of the key themes that you're

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
looking

54
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
to achieve um i'll give some examples of

55
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,560
tools that you might want to use as well

56
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
they're not endorsements of these tools

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
it's just kind of examples of things

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
that you might be wanting to use

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
and all of this is aimed at the kind of

60
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
context of quite a small company quite a

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
lean team um where you're kind of in a

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
high growth environment and a lot is

63
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,759
changing you need to get a lot of stuff

64
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,840
done so bear that in mind that this is

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
not also uh

66
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
gonna necessarily be correct if you're

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
in like a big business or an enterprise

68
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
kind of scale because different contexts

69
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
need different approaches too

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
so to kick off the business stuff i'm

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
going to introduce some hard truths to

72
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
bear in mind that will help kind of

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
ground you and help kind of align you to

74
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
what the business is wanting you to do

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,040
as you kick off might seem a little bit

76
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,959
harsh um but hopefully it'll make sense

77
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
as we go through the rest of the content

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
nobody cares about security

79
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
so this is the hardest one to accept for

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
most people here because people here are

81
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,959
going to be genuinely passionate about

82
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
it and you probably all wish that people

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
would take it more seriously

84
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,239
in reality if people do take it

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
seriously people know it's important and

86
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
but if it gets in the way of them doing

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
their job and it inconveniences them

88
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
they will try and strip it out or work

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,480
around it to make their lives easier

90
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,200
so

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
your job as a security person in a

92
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,239
business

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
is to me is to facilitate people being

94
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
able to go about their jobs in a secure

95
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
way um ideally in a way where they don't

96
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,519
even notice because you've made it so

97
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,519
serious

98
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,159
the point of the business is not

99
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,920
security now the only place this doesn't

100
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
apply is if you actually work for a

101
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,519
security company or a vendor but for the

102
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
vast majority of organizations security

103
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
is not the point of the business

104
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,920
so day to day it's not really anybody's

105
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,040
number one concern apart from yours

106
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,080
and this one's really important to

107
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
remember because kind of projecting a

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
sense that security is the most

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
important team um in the business it's

110
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
just gonna make nobody want to work with

111
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,359
you

112
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
you're not there to say no this is a

113
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
really important one um

114
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
so unless the company you join is made

115
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
up of people who are fresh graduates and

116
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,840
they've never worked anywhere else

117
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
before um people are going to have

118
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
preconceptions about what a security

119
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
team in a business is

120
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
um and almost certainly that

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
preconception is going to be that you're

122
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
the team that tells them that they can't

123
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
do stuff

124
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
so remember my last point you're there

125
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
to enable the business to work securely

126
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,680
um

127
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
in the vast majority of cases you'll be

128
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
able to work out a way that people can

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,239
do the tasks that they want to be doing

130
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,360
securely

131
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
if you just say no to everything to try

132
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,280
and eliminate as much risk as possible

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,239
um

134
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,280
people are just going to go behind your

135
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
back and do it anyway they're not going

136
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,519
to stop doing it they're just going to

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,640
stop telling you that they're doing

138
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
these things

139
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
and in almost every case your job isn't

140
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
to prevent people doing things it's to

141
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
work out a way that they can do the

142
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
things they want to be doing and

143
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
securely in a safe way so work with

144
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
people not against them

145
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
the final one is crucially important as

146
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
well

147
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,479
end users aren't stupid and you

148
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,600
shouldn't treat them like they are

149
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
because they'll really resent that um

150
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
they might not know as much about

151
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
security as you and they might do things

152
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
that give you anxiety but protecting

153
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
them and enabling them to work in a

154
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,120
secure way

155
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
it's why you're there in the first place

156
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
and so much of the groundwork for

157
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
building a security program um is about

158
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
establishing the relationships to people

159
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
and if you just crash in and tell them

160
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,759
that you know better it's not going to

161
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,880
make you any friends stolen it's going

162
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,680
to make your job a lot harder

163
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
so

164
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
once you've accepted all that the first

165
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
thing you need to do is work out where

166
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
you fit within the business that you're

167
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,759
part of

168
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,560
so

169
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
if you're lucky enough to be in an

170
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,039
organization that really does care about

171
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
security and other than one that just

172
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
sees it's a tick box or a formality this

173
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,639
is going to be a lot easier

174
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
now the goal here is basically to work

175
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
out what the business or the exact team

176
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
or whoever's in charge actually think

177
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
that you're here to do

178
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
because once you understand what their

179
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,360
priorities are um you can then work out

180
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
what security measures or controls help

181
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
support those aims and that's the best

182
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,639
way to start because if you kick off by

183
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
solving existing problems that people in

184
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
the business have it's really obvious

185
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
that you're providing value not doing a

186
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,360
good job

187
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
and this is arguably the most important

188
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
part of starting off your program as

189
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,280
well

190
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
um because this is where you engage with

191
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
people to find out what the problems are

192
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
and you make friends that will help you

193
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
further down the line and you really

194
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
important to start off by being the team

195
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
that solves problems for people rather

196
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
than the team that enforces controls and

197
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
makes people's jobs harder

198
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
so part of this is working out your

199
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
business's threat model and your risk

200
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
profile

201
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
so if you go into a small org where the

202
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
main concerns phishing or password

203
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
security don't start off with reverse

204
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
engineering malware you found in

205
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
assuming that they need to defend

206
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
themselves against like nation state

207
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
epts

208
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
this could be fun sure but you're not

209
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,720
going to last very long because you

210
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,400
haven't understood the problems the

211
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,160
concerns of the business and that they

212
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
are paying you to mitigate and solve

213
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,600
so

214
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
make sure that you start off at the

215
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,000
level the business is already at um

216
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
for a lot of organizations that does

217
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,479
mean that you're going to be kind of

218
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
hand holding them through rudimentary

219
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
basics as first steps but the first

220
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
steps are what you need to begin with to

221
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
be able to build towards a mature

222
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,759
security posture

223
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,000
so

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
this brings us to the foundations of

225
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
actually starting your program of which

226
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
there's kind of four key areas

227
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
communication tools processes

228
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
so the idea of communication is to be

229
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
approachable make sure other teams know

230
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
what you can help with what you're there

231
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319
for and i can't stress enough that other

232
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
teams need to see you as a helpful team

233
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
rather than one who hinders your

234
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,120
progress and if you can achieve that

235
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
early on it makes everything else that

236
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,599
you're going to do a lot easier

237
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,639
you're going to need some standard

238
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
processes and playbooks that define how

239
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
security works for you it might sound

240
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
like a very kind of enterprise way um to

241
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
start off but it doesn't have to be your

242
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
company's infosec policy could literally

243
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
just be a single side of it for um if

244
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,919
you wanted

245
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,280
you're obviously gonna need tools to

246
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
help you out and but it doesn't

247
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
necessarily mean you need to spend

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
hundreds of thousands on like um big

249
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
vendors um a lot of what you need can be

250
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
found into open source or done on a

251
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
budget i'll talk a bit later about what

252
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
kind of tools you might wanna you might

253
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,120
wanna look at deploy

254
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
and last but not least as a team

255
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
you're not necessarily in fact you're

256
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
probably not going to end up with a huge

257
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
team you might not end up with any team

258
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
it might just be you

259
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,960
um but kind of knowing what skill sets

260
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
are available and how they could help

261
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,520
with the things that you're going to

262
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
work on is really important

263
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
and there are more kind of roles and

264
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
specializations within security that

265
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,759
most people realize especially as you're

266
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,560
kind of starting out your career

267
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
so i'm not sure how well this has shown

268
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
up for the people at the back um

269
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
but this is a really good illustration

270
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
of just kind of how varied and extensive

271
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
the areas of responsibility within

272
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
security are

273
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
if you're going to be leading a security

274
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
function you need to be aware of all

275
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
these you don't need to know them all

276
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,120
you don't need to be an expert them all

277
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
but you need to know that these things

278
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
exist

279
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,080
so that when it comes time that you need

280
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
something from from one of these other

281
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
areas or or you can recognize the kind

282
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
of the points where these things start

283
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
to become important or relevant

284
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
i'm not going to go over this whole

285
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,719
diagram in depth because that's going to

286
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
take up the whole hour um but once you

287
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,399
understand the environment that your

288
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,919
business is operating in and what the

289
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,839
security needs are

290
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,800
um

291
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,680
look back at this and kind of it will be

292
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
more obvious as to what areas you can

293
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
pick out as the key priorities and the

294
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,640
places that you need to focus on first

295
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
in general i'd suggest that a lot of the

296
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
kind of enterprise risk management and

297
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
governance stuff down at the bottom

298
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
right is not a great way to start off

299
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
and it quickly becomes kind of really

300
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
bureaucratic time sync and you deliver

301
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,560
more value more quickly by focusing on

302
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
things like access control and 2fa

303
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
but overall in in a situation where

304
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,200
you're kind of just starting off your

305
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
program if you're if you're going to um

306
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
grow your team you want to try and find

307
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,959
a really good security generalist

308
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
to help you who can focus on any of

309
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
these tasks based on kind of the

310
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,959
priorities of the business um security

311
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
engineering security ops those sorts of

312
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
areas um

313
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
and that will help you focus on the

314
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
first task which is securing the

315
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
organization because if you're an

316
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
that builds product an insecure

317
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
organization cannot ship a secure

318
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
product so you need to focus on the

319
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,030
organization first

320
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,519
[Music]

321
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,480
so

322
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,519
we've got some idea of the kind of

323
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,640
business environment that you'll be

324
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,200
operating in now um and it's always

325
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
worth clearing this in mind because

326
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,399
thinking about what you're doing in the

327
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,160
context of the business it's going to

328
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
make you a more valuable employee and

329
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,519
it's going to find it you're going to

330
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
find that it makes it easier for you to

331
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,480
make progress

332
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
through your career so i'm going to move

333
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
on to the practical side so actually

334
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
implementing the program there as well

335
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
so your security roadmap is again a

336
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,600
long-term vision of where you see the

337
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
security posture of your company going

338
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
and long-term how you expect to get

339
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
there

340
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
so for the kind of company i'm talking

341
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
about which is a kind of large

342
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
engineering team you ship a product to

343
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
customers and i split it into three

344
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
broad themes and you can categorize most

345
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,519
kind of initiatives and controls under

346
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,320
these

347
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
and they are the organization product

348
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,839
and the infrastructure

349
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
so the org pillar covers things that

350
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
affect all the staff and act across all

351
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
the business

352
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
so this is things like policies

353
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
processes password managers and actually

354
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,839
kind of establishing the security

355
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
culture for the business as well the

356
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
product pillar covers all aspects of

357
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
security that relate directly to the

358
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
product that you build

359
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
so this is things like application

360
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,560
security

361
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
tooling for developers and code scan

362
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
and then the infrastructure pillar

363
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
covers any kind of on-prem equipment

364
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
that you might have cloud services

365
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
making sure that you're aware of your

366
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
overall attack surface and that you're

367
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
monitoring it as well

368
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,040
and breaking the initiatives down like

369
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
this and can help you plan and

370
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
prioritize what's required

371
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
to build your security program

372
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,399
so for the rest of talk i'm going to

373
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,519
discuss the kind of things you might

374
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
want to put in your roadmap and then

375
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,800
we'll wrap up with what you should do

376
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
with your finished roadmap and how to

377
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
proceed on from there

378
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
i'm going to start with policies and

379
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
processes because

380
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
it's the most boring one

381
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
and i know for certain a lot of people

382
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
here are going to think that it's kind

383
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
of a thing you only need to care about

384
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
if you work for big banks but it's

385
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,719
unfortunately not the case

386
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,959
so you need to be aware of this for

387
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
companies of all sizes it's not just an

388
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
enterprise thing

389
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
and if your company sells to other

390
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
businesses you really quickly find out

391
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,480
that these things are just

392
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,639
non-negotiable and that you have to

393
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
answer security questions about your

394
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
products and your processes and if you

395
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
have docs and policies that you can pull

396
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,519
out to answer these questions it makes

397
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
things much smoother and much more

398
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
seamless

399
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
so

400
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
what kind of policies you actually need

401
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
to start with

402
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
um at a minimum you want to have a kind

403
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
of general infosight policy that

404
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,880
basically defines

405
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
what you expect and require for your

406
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
employees this could be things like

407
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
using 2fa enforcing

408
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
disk encryption on devices password

409
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
managers things like that

410
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
and this should be a readable document

411
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,880
it shouldn't be long it shouldn't be in

412
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
legalese it should be straightforward

413
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
and simple for people to understand

414
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
you're also probably going to want some

415
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
kind of data protection policy that

416
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
outlines like the kind of controls that

417
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,079
you have to protect data the fact that

418
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
you use these privilege

419
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
controls

420
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
to manage data access and things like

421
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
that uh requiring encryption for

422
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
personal data and who to go to if

423
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
there's a problem or a data breach

424
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,000
and when you're working out which of

425
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
these policies you need and which ones

426
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,800
to work on first

427
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
one of the first things you should

428
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,839
consider is if your business has to

429
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,200
comply with any kind of compliance

430
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
regimes like gdpr and things like that

431
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
this depends on what you do and what

432
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
kind of data that you process

433
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,279
but it's a really good way to direct

434
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,560
your attention to kind of the most

435
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
important and impactful things to work

436
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
on first um

437
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,240
if you don't need to comply with

438
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
anything specific think about maybe your

439
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
customers that you're selling things on

440
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
to do um

441
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
if you're selling to any other business

442
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,519
you're they're going to want to know how

443
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,120
you comply with gdpr even if you don't

444
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
think it's relevant even if you think

445
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
it's interesting not that interesting

446
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
and

447
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
you have to have documentation that

448
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
explains how you deal with this because

449
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,639
they need that to be able to pass on to

450
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
their customers

451
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
it's really difficult to sell products

452
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
to other businesses now without having

453
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
shown that you've thought about privacy

454
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
you've thought about data protection

455
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
data security

456
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
and if you're able to answer sales

457
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
questions with things like yeah we've

458
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
got a policy for that here it is it's

459
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
much easier and it just makes things go

460
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,480
a lot quicker

461
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
but also don't go nuts with it you don't

462
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
need policies to cover every possible

463
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,279
scenario

464
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
or every possible compliance regime

465
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
the aim of the policies are to make

466
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
things easier and to be useful and help

467
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,839
with answering people's questions not to

468
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,440
kind of drown you in pointless paperwork

469
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,399
and bureaucracy

470
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,279
so

471
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
now that you know what policies do you

472
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
need how do you actually start writing

473
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
because that seems like quite an

474
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
overwhelming thing to have to do to

475
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
begin with how much detail you put in

476
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,440
luckily there's a bunch of frameworks

477
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
and industry bodies that can help with

478
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
that

479
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
so there's nist who are an american

480
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
government body they publish a huge

481
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
amount of documentation and standards on

482
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
building security programs and even kind

483
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
of down to technical controls like

484
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
encryption specifications and the kind

485
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
of thing you should use

486
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
there is sans who most people here will

487
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
probably have heard of um a training

488
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,760
body and they provide a lot of sample

489
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
templates and that are kind of just like

490
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,079
basic boilerplate and that you can slap

491
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,279
your company name on and you can make

492
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,040
little tweaks here and there and to

493
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
match the context that you're in

494
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
there's cyber essentials um now this is

495
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
a uk government effort who's out of

496
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,839
cyber

497
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,199
essentials most people

498
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,480
um

499
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
so it's not

500
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
policies in itself but the kind of the

501
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
controls that they recommend and and

502
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,279
require are a really good way for you to

503
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,720
kind of direct

504
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
what you want to focus on first

505
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,079
because these are kind of the main

506
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,120
things that other companies will be

507
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,399
looking for

508
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,639
and cis benchmarks again they're not

509
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,320
policies as such but they're kind of

510
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
like the authoritative standards on

511
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
controls and configurations for

512
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,800
basically any kind of system you can

513
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,320
imagine operating systems cloud

514
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
providers um

515
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
that define kind of the controls you

516
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
should have the configuration you should

517
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,839
have for best practices um and again use

518
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
these benchmarks to inform the technical

519
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,560
content of the policies that you write

520
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
and also gitlab um so they can their

521
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,160
stuff can be really useful when you're

522
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
working out what they need um

523
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,959
because gitlab publish online publicly

524
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,560
all of their internal policies their

525
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
employee handbook everything and they

526
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
have a really mature security posture

527
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
and so it's really easy to kind of see

528
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
where you want to end up by using some

529
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
of their content and to help inform kind

530
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
of things that you're writing as well

531
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
and you can write them from scratch if

532
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
you want but it's difficult to know

533
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,639
where to begin um so i kind of recommend

534
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,920
just starting off with a sample one that

535
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,519
someone else has written like the sans

536
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,199
ones and just making little tweaks to

537
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
suit your business and the controls that

538
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,079
you want to introduce

539
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,759
um i'm gonna mention a lot of tools in

540
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
the rest of my slides but first a little

541
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
bit about how you could go about picking

542
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
any of these tools um

543
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
that you might have on your radar so

544
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
this is a controversial one

545
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
and it's specifically aimed at the kind

546
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,600
of startup or up environment and

547
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
where you don't have a lot of time you

548
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,320
don't have a lot of people to help

549
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
maintain things um

550
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,920
so wherever possible if you're buying

551
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,560
security tooling prefer options that are

552
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,120
sas or managed by a vendor

553
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,399
and the main reason for this is if

554
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
you're self-hosting an important tool

555
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
there's now loads of other costs

556
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
associated with that that weren't

557
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
immediately obvious um necessarily which

558
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,199
i'll go over in a second

559
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
but at high level the main reason that

560
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,240
you're employed

561
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
is to provide value to the business

562
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,799
right

563
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,039
your value with the two comes with your

564
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
ability to operate and interpret the

565
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
results and the alerts and act on on

566
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,119
things from that tool it doesn't come

567
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,720
from adding another system that you have

568
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
to patch and maintain and backup and

569
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
things like that because that's not what

570
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
you're there for

571
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,319
um

572
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,119
one tip for the process here

573
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
is when you're speaking to vendors ask

574
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
if they have other security

575
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
documentation or compliance certs or pen

576
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
test reports and things that they'll

577
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
only disclose to you

578
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
with a non-disclosure agreement so most

579
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,200
companies will have kind of the security

580
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
and privacy page on their website

581
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
there's nothing exciting there usually

582
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
the juicy stuff is the one that you have

583
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,000
to sign the nda for to be able to see

584
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
they won't announce that to you probably

585
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,440
but if you ask for it they're usually

586
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
more than happy to give you this kind of

587
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,039
stuff and that gives you a really good

588
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
idea as to what their internal security

589
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,720
posture is like and it gives you an idea

590
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
how they look for vulnerabilities and

591
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
issues and how they resolve them as well

592
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
a vendor who can't give you information

593
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
like that is a bit of a red flag um so

594
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
when i say use sas meaning like use it

595
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
safely don't just buy anything you can

596
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
find because someone else is running it

597
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,918
for you

598
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
i also want to quickly go into

599
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
some of the things that are kind of

600
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
often overlooked when you're working out

601
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,919
whether to go with sas or whether you're

602
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
going to self-host a tool

603
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
and explain a little bit more about why

604
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
i lean towards the idea of sas being the

605
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
way to go for your growing business with

606
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,799
quite kind of lean team for operating

607
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
things so when you've done your initial

608
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
comparison you've probably looked at the

609
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
slightly cheaper license fee and the

610
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
cost of running a vm on a cloud provider

611
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,320
and you're like that's how much it would

612
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
cost us to self-host it

613
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,919
but it's not really as simple as that

614
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
and there's a whole bunch of other

615
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
things you need to factor in that the

616
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,120
vendor is probably our competent vendor

617
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
is probably running for you um

618
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,360
transparently to you as part of the sas

619
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
service

620
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,440
so there's a few things you need to

621
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
think about

622
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
uh your time which is as a security

623
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,600
person expensive and

624
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,360
patching the west patching the product

625
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
itself ensuring that everything's up to

626
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
date and

627
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
backing up any data that it has

628
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
scheduling it the extra storage costs

629
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,840
that come from that checking whether

630
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
they're working or not

631
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,480
and

632
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
reliability and uptime

633
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,160
if the sas version runs across like

634
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
multiple aws regions and there's

635
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
failover and things like that and you're

636
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
running it on an old pc in a cupboard

637
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
you're not comparing like for like there

638
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
that's not the same thing

639
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,679
um

640
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,120
if that collects lots of data do you

641
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
need to manage load balancing or things

642
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,520
like ssl termination um are they doing

643
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
things for you like a web application

644
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
firewall or ddos prevention

645
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,799
and then finally think about how the

646
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
environment you would deploy into

647
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
actually compares to the sas vendors so

648
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
if you're deploying a security tool

649
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
um

650
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
where integrity of the data is important

651
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
if you're going to deploy that into a

652
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,440
cloud account that's shared with a bunch

653
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
of developers where they would have

654
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
access to that tool that's not really

655
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
that great so there's just a few

656
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
examples but my point is main point your

657
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,799
time's valuable and you should consider

658
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,400
whether self-hosting something is really

659
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
the right choice for you and whether you

660
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,720
can do it well enough for for the

661
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,360
purpose of the two

662
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
so one of the first things that you

663
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,679
should consider introducing is password

664
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
manager

665
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,799
i don't think i need to sell the

666
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
benefits of a password manager to

667
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
anybody here but you might have to sell

668
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,480
it to the people with the money

669
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,159
in your company especially if the

670
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,080
concept's new to them

671
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,200
so

672
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
one way to approach this is to focus on

673
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
how it helps the business because that's

674
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,400
what they really want to know about um

675
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
an executive with budget

676
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,919
they don't care about the intricacies of

677
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,080
credential stuff right they just don't

678
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
um but they do understand the concept of

679
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,320
reducing risk for the business

680
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
so if you can find kind of recent or

681
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,679
relevant examples

682
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
um around like data breaches or attacks

683
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
where the entry point was pure quality

684
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
or reuse credentials and that's really

685
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,480
helpful to support your case um same

686
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,679
with stats around phishing since

687
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
password managers reduce the chances of

688
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
a successful fish by only kind of

689
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
autofilling credentials on sites with

690
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,280
the right to me

691
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
you've also got pick one

692
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
um so there's a few criteria that you

693
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
should look for here it needs to be easy

694
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
for all of the staff to use not just

695
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,320
techies um some weird self-hosted key

696
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
pass installed that syncs with dropbox

697
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
that isn't used it isn't usable for

698
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
non-technical staff and it's a really

699
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,080
bad way to start

700
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
it should make it easy to share secrets

701
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
between uh employees which might seem

702
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
counter-intuitive but people are people

703
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
are going to do this anyway

704
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
and if you don't provide a secure way

705
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
for them to do it they're going to use

706
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
things like email or slack or text

707
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,240
messages instead

708
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
and finally the company that you go with

709
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
should publish a lot of documentation

710
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,640
that goes into significant detail about

711
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
how their security works how they secure

712
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,679
their infrastructure how they implement

713
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,480
things and how they review it

714
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,159
so one password for example they have a

715
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,480
white paper that's a hundred pages long

716
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
it details their infrastructure security

717
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
how they manage keys and cryptography

718
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,080
and it's a fascinating read um it's an

719
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,159
insane amount of detail um and it helps

720
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
you kind of

721
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,120
appreciate the security posture that

722
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
goes into these things and verifying

723
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,840
whether that's enough for the kind of

724
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
data that you're putting into

725
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,720
um

726
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
it's also worth considering if there's

727
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
any secondary benefits to password

728
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
manager um so

729
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
the largest vendors people like one

730
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,919
password or lastpass if you buy business

731
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
accounts from them they come with free

732
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
personal accounts that you can then give

733
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
your staff and the benefit of that is

734
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
that you are then showing your staff

735
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,320
that you're not just caring about

736
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,159
security for the business you're giving

737
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,600
them the capability to help secure

738
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,520
themselves and help improve the online

739
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
safety for their family as well

740
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
which can be a really good start to help

741
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
kind of build out that security culture

742
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,919
among your employees

743
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,099
[Music]

744
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,309
[Music]

745
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
sure so the question is um

746
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
how much do kind of vendor policies and

747
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,360
information from them inform the

748
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
security controls at rasa and the answer

749
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,799
is hugely yeah

750
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,600
um

751
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,360
this kind of thing is

752
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,799
really beneficial because you're seeing

753
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,320
how security works at other companies

754
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,679
and you can steal all their good ideas

755
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
and incorporate them into what you're

756
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
doing business yeah

757
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
it's a it's a really good source of kind

758
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
of knowledge and information about how

759
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,960
how

760
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,640
successful and large security

761
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
enterprises run stuff and if you can

762
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,840
cherry pick ideas for them absolutely

763
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,559
um

764
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
so hot and heals password managers

765
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
single sign-on um

766
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,919
the idea here is that you only have one

767
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
system where you manage all your users

768
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
and then your tools can integrate with

769
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,799
this um to authenticate users to it

770
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,000
it's really useful because it makes

771
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,679
onboarding and off-boarding users much

772
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,440
easier and because you only have a

773
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
single source of trade for who's

774
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
employed and you only have one place to

775
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
remove users from when they leave

776
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,000
you might already have access to an

777
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
identity provider without realizing it

778
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
uh if you pay for google workspace or g

779
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
suite or whatever it's called this week

780
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,799
um

781
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
that can function as one if you have

782
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
azure or aws accounts there's stuff

783
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,320
built in there as well and it's not

784
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
always something that you have to pay

785
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,799
another vendor for you might already

786
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
have this without realizing it

787
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,320
another kind of more niche benefit is

788
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
that you can use single sign-on to

789
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,159
strengthen the security posture of other

790
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
third-party tools that you integrate

791
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
with and there's quite a few tools out

792
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,039
there that support single center

793
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,480
integration but they don't natively

794
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
support their own 2fa and

795
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
so if you can restrict sign into those

796
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
apps to your single sign-on tool you've

797
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
kind of brought with you the 2fa

798
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
benefits from your identity provider

799
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,760
over to this other tool that didn't

800
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,240
support it and

801
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
so

802
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,679
this all sounds great it is you should

803
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,520
use it wherever you can um but kind of

804
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
accept that not all tools or third-party

805
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,799
services are going to offer it so you're

806
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,919
probably going to need a password

807
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,159
manager as well

808
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
but there's one major flow of a single

809
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
sign-on and that's usually whether or

810
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
not you can actually afford it

811
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,919
um the provider isn't usually expensive

812
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,520
and we just discussed you might already

813
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
have one without realizing it

814
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
but paying for single sign-on support

815
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
within your tools themselves is often

816
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,840
very expensive

817
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,120
um so this is a screenshot from a

818
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,600
website called sso.tax

819
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
which collects examples of vendors that

820
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
are charging particularly ludicrous

821
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
amounts for single sign-on support as

822
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
part of their kind of enterprise package

823
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
and

824
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,279
they do this because they can and they

825
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,440
get away with it you know um

826
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
vendors know that companies where big

827
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
companies where sso is kind of mandated

828
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
will pay whatever they ask um

829
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
to be able to meet those requirements

830
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
so while you should use single sign on

831
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
wherever you can there will be some

832
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
places especially if you're a small

833
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,600
company or a startup where it just

834
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,039
doesn't make the financial sense to

835
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,279
upgrade to a plan um that will allow you

836
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
to the most egregious example is hubspot

837
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
who have a six thousand three hundred

838
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,960
percent markup between their normal user

839
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,559
tier and the first tier that allows you

840
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,559
to integrate and single sign-on which is

841
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,120
just crazy

842
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
and another thing i don't need to

843
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
convince anyone up here is the value of

844
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,360
tfa

845
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,919
um but you should um as a kind of admin

846
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
for from apps across your business and

847
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
force it wherever you can

848
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,520
um as i mentioned earlier even if a

849
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
service doesn't natively enforce it see

850
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
if there's other ways that you can

851
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,320
enable it like integrating the single

852
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,000
sign off

853
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and at risk of starting another classic

854
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
infosec twitter flamewar um

855
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,679
any 2fa is better than no 2f8 right

856
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,760
so you can get upset about sms-2a as

857
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,080
much as you like and because it's not

858
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,679
perfect but it's better than not having

859
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,679
any 2f8 at all

860
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,360
you shouldn't pick it over other methods

861
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,200
but it's better than not having anything

862
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
at all and you should always use the

863
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,600
strongest method that's available to you

864
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,799
um

865
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,279
so here's the kind of spectrum of how

866
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
secure an authentication mechanism is

867
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,400
from kind of least secure at the bottom

868
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
up to more secure at the top i'm pretty

869
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,360
sure that's not going to be legible past

870
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
like the first three rows um you're

871
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,679
gonna have to take my word for it so

872
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
this is a really valuable graphic um not

873
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
only does it give you a kind of

874
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,360
unambiguous ordering of um

875
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
what methods are strongest it also lays

876
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
out what each of those methods are

877
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,320
vulnerable to in terms of kind of

878
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,760
attacks that can work against them

879
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,039
i've added the triangle on the right

880
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,399
that kind of illustrates the volume of

881
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,840
attacks as well so the higher you

882
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,320
progress on this maturity model the

883
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
fewer automated attacks you're going to

884
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
have that can be successful against you

885
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
and the fewer adversaries that are going

886
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,200
to be out there that actually have the

887
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,440
capability and

888
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
to take on and controls like that

889
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
and as i mentioned earlier this helps

890
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
you work out what's suitable for your

891
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,919
threat model in the context that you're

892
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,600
in so the best option will be right at

893
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,080
the top um hardware back passwordless

894
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
authentication but if your company's

895
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
right down here at the bottom you're

896
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
still on kind of stage two or maybe even

897
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
stage three it's a big leap to get

898
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
everybody right up to the top um

899
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,960
in one go and improving the maturity of

900
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
security across your organization is a

901
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
journey and you have to make sure that

902
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,480
you bring everybody with you as well you

903
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
can't just kind of one-up other teams

904
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,919
and leave folk behind

905
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,919
so based on that it's okay to make

906
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,840
incremental improvements and if you can

907
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,679
do that quicker than waiting to make a

908
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,600
big change it's worth doing so if you

909
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,840
can enable sms to pay for stuff that's

910
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,279
an incremental improvement you shouldn't

911
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,360
wait until everybody's got ub keys to be

912
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,039
able to to do stuff like this make

913
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,399
incremental improvements wherever you

914
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,959
can and because they're still beneficial

915
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,880
um

916
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
so carrying on from the theme of 2fa i

917
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,240
want to specifically touch on hardware

918
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,320
security keys

919
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,679
most of the keys that you'll see are

920
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
made by ubico um but other manufacturers

921
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
are available

922
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,440
and there's a lot you can do with them

923
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,279
but there's kind of a few main themes as

924
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,520
to why you might want to roll them out

925
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
and they're basically the gold standard

926
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
for authentication at this point and

927
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,039
some of you might have used them before

928
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,200
when you're prompted for 2fa you tap the

929
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
local dot in the key and that's your

930
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,360
authenticated and the process that's

931
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
going on under the hood there is

932
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640
actually really sophisticated and more

933
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
so that people might realize

934
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
you can't fish or man in the middle

935
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
credentials for a site that's using

936
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,880
these keys with a modern algorithm like

937
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,159
weapon

938
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,840
or something like that and for these

939
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
sites the authentication

940
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,240
is is pretty pretty substantial under

941
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,799
the hood but it's done in a way and that

942
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,240
it's kind of transparent to the user and

943
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
you make things easier for the user

944
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
whilst also making things more secure

945
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,840
and so for sites like this the site

946
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
authenticates you with the key

947
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
um but the key authenticates the site at

948
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
the same time as well um with a special

949
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
handshake which which eliminates whole

950
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
classes of attack so not only is there a

951
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,640
second factor but it can be fished and

952
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
it can't be stolen like a kind of six

953
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
digit code for an app from an app or a

954
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,080
text and used kind of out of band

955
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
without your knowledge the key

956
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
physically has to be involved in that

957
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,720
transaction to be able to authenticate

958
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
you can use some different functionality

959
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,679
on these keys as well you can use them

960
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
for ssh authentication or you can use

961
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,240
them for signing git commits by your

962
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,039
developers to show that once a commit

963
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,520
has been made to your product repo um

964
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,279
that that developer physically had

965
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,799
possession of that key which proves that

966
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,960
it was them who made it who made that

967
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
commit and that's a way to kind of help

968
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
reduce the the impact of the likelihood

969
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
of like supply chain attacks or stolen

970
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,399
get credentials being being used to put

971
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,960
things into your product

972
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
and you should consider starting this by

973
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
rolling them out to your highest risk

974
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,240
users which is people like admins and

975
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,360
it's also your exec team and once you've

976
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,640
got them kind of rolled out to everyone

977
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,159
you can start to slowly enforce their

978
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
usage across systems until everything

979
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,679
gets covered by strong hardware backed

980
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,760
authentication and enforcing them on

981
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,279
your single sign-on provider alone is a

982
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,799
big win because that should then impact

983
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,640
multiple products and accounts as well

984
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,679
uh

985
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
lastly the org level i want to talk

986
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
about device management and kind of for

987
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
all like the laptops that you hand out

988
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
to employees as well

989
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
so some small companies don't roll out

990
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
device management right at the start

991
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
thinking there's only a few devices so

992
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
it's not that important

993
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
um but in reality this is the easiest

994
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,399
time to roll it out um and kind of

995
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
secure the devices that you have and

996
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,919
establish like a baseline configuration

997
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,080
that you know works across them all

998
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,960
um

999
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
you can't secure the assets and devices

1000
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
that you don't know about so making sure

1001
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,399
you have kind of a single console you

1002
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,519
can view the status and the

1003
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,039
configuration of all your devices is

1004
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,320
really valuable

1005
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
so there's a few benefits to that

1006
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,640
um like i said you easily enforce

1007
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,399
baseline security controls across all

1008
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
your devices so things like disk

1009
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,360
encryption

1010
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,279
you can see if devices have deviated

1011
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,840
from that and and

1012
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
map the policies that you wrote right at

1013
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,440
the start onto the controls that you

1014
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,799
then apply across all your devices

1015
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,399
you can enable automated software

1016
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
patching across all your devices which

1017
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
is such a basic security wind that's

1018
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,559
often kind of overlooked and but

1019
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,960
combining this with mdm software the in

1020
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,559
kind of inventories everything that's on

1021
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,559
your devices gives you a really powerful

1022
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
tool because then if some new software

1023
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,399
vulnerability comes out you can check

1024
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
very very quickly which of your users

1025
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,159
are affected and if any of them need to

1026
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,480
be patched

1027
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,399
also it lets you lock or raise devices

1028
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,080
that get lost which is especially useful

1029
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,519
if you have staff for execs that are

1030
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,720
travelling

1031
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
um it also sounds like a thing that

1032
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,720
would be expensive but it's actually not

1033
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
weirdly um a basic kind of cloud-based

1034
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
ndm platform that you update things and

1035
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,760
apply controls to devices is usually

1036
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,519
like a few pounds per device per month

1037
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,679
it's really not an expensive thing um to

1038
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
roll out

1039
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,799
so

1040
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,120
um i'm going to move on to securing the

1041
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,919
product that you're building there

1042
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,519
so the obvious place to start for this

1043
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
would presumably be a pen test and seems

1044
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
sensible lets you inventory all the

1045
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,279
issues that you might be having

1046
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,799
yeah with the product and crack on with

1047
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,919
solving them but if the pen test is the

1048
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,360
first interaction you have with the

1049
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,440
engineering team it's not really a great

1050
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
idea it's not the best idea

1051
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
unless you have an urgent business need

1052
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
for one like a customer who isn't going

1053
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,760
to buy your product until they get a

1054
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,240
report on this stuff

1055
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,000
now that might seem counterintuitive but

1056
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,440
the reason for that

1057
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,039
is that if you're new and you come into

1058
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
a dev team and you slap down a report of

1059
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,120
vulnerabilities some of them are going

1060
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,200
to take that personally and

1061
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
some of them are going to see you as the

1062
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,159
person who doesn't know the background

1063
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,519
or doesn't know what what they've been

1064
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,679
up to and how hard they've working and

1065
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,039
coming in and telling them they've done

1066
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,320
a bad job they've introduced all these

1067
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,880
vulnerabilities and and if you do that

1068
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
you're then going to find it really hard

1069
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,240
and it's going to take a lot longer to

1070
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,840
kind of rebuild that trust and get the

1071
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,159
engineering team on your site

1072
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,200
so

1073
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
instead it's a much better strategy to

1074
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
kind of delay that for a couple of weeks

1075
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
or a few months to focus on building

1076
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,320
relationships with the engineers and

1077
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,600
showing them that you are there to help

1078
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,200
find out what their security problems

1079
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
are

1080
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
so maybe there's vulnerabilities that

1081
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,559
they think are issues and but they

1082
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,760
aren't getting the time to fix that you

1083
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
could lend your voice to to kind of help

1084
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
increase the priority of that

1085
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,159
and

1086
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,919
maybe they're having security relevant

1087
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,279
problems and that you can help to

1088
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,960
automate like updating dependencies

1089
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
across code and things like that and

1090
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,079
maybe they just don't have much

1091
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,480
background security knowledge

1092
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
providing kind of training and

1093
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,280
background knowledge for devs around

1094
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
secure coding and application

1095
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
vulnerabilities helps them connect what

1096
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,079
they are doing day-to-day with the

1097
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,359
impact of vulnerabilities that they

1098
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,560
could introduce um and making that link

1099
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,879
is really key for a lot of devs and it

1100
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,000
will kind of

1101
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,839
help them click that what they are doing

1102
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,960
day to day has security impacts and

1103
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,800
and ideally you make at least a few of

1104
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
them kind of more enthusiastic about

1105
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
security as well

1106
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,079
and then once you've achieved that a pen

1107
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
test changes from being perceived as a

1108
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,719
report about their feelings to a report

1109
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,159
containing new challenges that they can

1110
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,359
work on because they understand the

1111
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,280
context behind it they understand the

1112
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,079
importance of fixing things um

1113
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
and the kind of motivation behind

1114
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,320
resolving them

1115
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,079
uh as i mentioned earlier you're gonna

1116
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,160
need to provide some training to your

1117
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
devs and specifically focus around

1118
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
secure coding

1119
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
the worst way you can do this is to give

1120
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
them just screens and screens of

1121
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
documentation and for them to read

1122
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,880
they like to code so get them into

1123
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
practical activities and kind of

1124
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,160
gamified

1125
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,839
platforms as quickly as possible so

1126
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,320
there's one called secure code warrior

1127
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
um where you learn about application

1128
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
security by finding vulnerabilities in

1129
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,320
code snippets and fixing them and seeing

1130
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,240
how they can be exploited

1131
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,800
and understanding the kind of end-to-end

1132
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,560
chain from them writing vulnerable codes

1133
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,240
to it being exploited and they're being

1134
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,440
like a data leak or something like that

1135
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
and that kind of thing really helps

1136
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
people build that mental model where

1137
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,240
they see the effects and the kind of

1138
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,598
impacts of their implementation choices

1139
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,599
um most coding training focuses around

1140
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,599
the obos top 10 which is a list of kind

1141
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,839
of the most commonly seen types

1142
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,079
of software vulnerabilities and this is

1143
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
a really good place to start and you'll

1144
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,200
probably cover like

1145
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,480
ninety five percent of the volumes in

1146
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
your application um

1147
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,040
by teaching your divs

1148
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:13,440
[Music]

1149
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,599
cool

1150
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,920
does anybody have an issue

1151
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
cool all right

1152
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
um

1153
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,359
so obos produces um cheat sheets that

1154
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,079
helps dev to kind of securely implement

1155
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,839
like common functionality like password

1156
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,720
storage or api security um

1157
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
and these are really valuable resources

1158
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
for devs to know about because they're

1159
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,040
written to kind of um to be aimed at

1160
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
devs they're written in language they

1161
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,599
understand they have code snippets and

1162
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,240
things through them um and one steps

1163
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,920
know about them and know that they exist

1164
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
and know that there's this kind of

1165
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
trusted location where they can have

1166
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,000
their security questions answered

1167
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,599
they'll start to use them naturally

1168
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,280
finally if you're not in a position

1169
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,040
where you can hire actual application

1170
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
security engineers for whatever reason

1171
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,119
um you can try starting a security

1172
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,119
champions program where basically each

1173
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,560
team

1174
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
or engineering squad has like a person

1175
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,480
with a particular interest in security

1176
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
and they get a little bit more training

1177
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,000
and become like the subject matter

1178
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,599
expert to kind of disseminate security

1179
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,520
knowledge among the team and also act as

1180
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
a point of contact who can escalate

1181
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,320
things if they spot security um issues

1182
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
that could end up having an impact to

1183
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,319
you

1184
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
uh you also want to have code security

1185
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
scanning done as part of your build

1186
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,880
process uh it's not like a substitution

1187
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
for having a person do it or having a

1188
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
pen test but it's like another layer to

1189
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,640
help catch more things before they end

1190
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,680
up in the product that you ship

1191
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,440
application security is a whole

1192
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,599
discipline in itself um but there's a

1193
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,880
few tips that are clickable kind of

1194
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
regardless of what your tech stack looks

1195
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,839
like or what stage you're at

1196
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,680
um shift left is a phrase that you you

1197
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,800
might have heard before it's become a

1198
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,560
bit of a slogan for a lot of appsec

1199
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,920
vendors

1200
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,320
essentially what this means is that you

1201
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
need to shift um

1202
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,480
scan results and security information um

1203
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,040
as close to where devs write the code as

1204
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
possible you need to kind of shorten the

1205
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,640
cycle between them writing code and

1206
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,480
getting security feedback on that to be

1207
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,560
as small as possible

1208
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,320
and that means it's easier for them to

1209
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,839
kind of integrate fixes as they're

1210
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,079
writing um

1211
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,040
and

1212
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
they don't see it as like a kind of

1213
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,920
annoying chore that's tacked on right at

1214
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
the end

1215
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,920
um

1216
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,280
you want to have security in bed at

1217
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
every stage of the development life

1218
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
cycle um

1219
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,760
but it's really crucial to get the

1220
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
actionable results delivered right to

1221
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,359
the devs as they're working as quickly

1222
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,440
as possible um

1223
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,200
as soon as you can after they've written

1224
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,240
the code

1225
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
so this is why a lot of code scanning

1226
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,920
tools offer like extensions for id's or

1227
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
text editors that developers use and

1228
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,359
this is a really good way to introduce

1229
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,640
it because literally as soon as they

1230
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
write the code they can get feedback on

1231
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,240
whether that could have introduced um

1232
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,280
security issues as well

1233
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,200
another thing you shouldn't do is enable

1234
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,480
a whole bunch of different security

1235
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,000
scanning tools that can like feel your

1236
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
build pipeline and without having tuned

1237
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,400
them or looked at the kind of results

1238
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
that you're getting out of them

1239
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
there's hate this and they'll just work

1240
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,599
around the scans and the results that

1241
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,520
you have and

1242
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,720
ignore the results because they don't

1243
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,200
see the value in it so before you get to

1244
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
the point where some of your scanning

1245
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,560
tools should be able to fail bills

1246
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
and kind of get the code sent back to

1247
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,359
devs to fix

1248
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,640
you want to make sure you've reviewed

1249
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,160
the kind of findings that it has and

1250
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
tuned it to make sure that they are

1251
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,680
sensible and they're valuable

1252
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,680
scanning also isn't just for source code

1253
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
and you get like linters and scanners

1254
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,839
for a whole bunch of other things too

1255
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,960
config files and yandex make a scanner

1256
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
for nginx the web server their config

1257
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
files and they can identify like

1258
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
vulnerable configurations or common

1259
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,359
mistakes that you can write with these

1260
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
files that can then lead to exploitable

1261
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,079
vulnerabilities in your app

1262
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,320
you can scan docker files that kind of

1263
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
define the containers that you you

1264
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,079
produce to deploy your product

1265
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,760
and you can scan the images that are

1266
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,079
produced as well um to kind of help you

1267
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
stick to best practices and identify if

1268
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,520
you're shipping any vulnerabilities in

1269
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,359
like os packages or dependencies that

1270
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,760
aren't directly related to your product

1271
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,599
code

1272
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,200
and finally you want to automate as much

1273
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,280
of this as possible it takes time to do

1274
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,960
but the most desirable end state to get

1275
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,720
to is where all of these kind of things

1276
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
are automated and a dev is only involved

1277
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,359
if they really need to be um so for

1278
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,800
example if you have a thing that's

1279
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,599
updating uh vulnerable dependencies and

1280
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,520
packages in your code a dev doesn't need

1281
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,280
to do that it's like i'm

1282
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,800
changing a couple of numbers in a config

1283
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,319
file like it's not a

1284
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,040
valuable use of their type so instead

1285
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
try and fix automatically run it through

1286
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,640
all your tests and if something fails

1287
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,560
then and it hasn't worked then a dev can

1288
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,800
step in and do it but otherwise um the

1289
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,560
happy path is that a lot of these things

1290
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,960
can kind of be automated away and you

1291
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,040
get better security and your devs have

1292
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,359
less kind of boring tasks and to work on

1293
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,680
um a nice segue between product and

1294
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,359
infrastructure is infrastructure is

1295
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,520
closed which kind of spans both

1296
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,839
so if you played around with cloud stuff

1297
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
before probably click through a web ui

1298
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,760
and or maybe run some cli commands and

1299
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,359
you've ended up creating specific

1300
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
infrastructure that you form

1301
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
now the idea behind infrastructure's

1302
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,960
code is that you define the

1303
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,800
infrastructure you want usually in

1304
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
something that looks kind of like a json

1305
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
or a yaml type file

1306
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
and then a tool handles the deployment

1307
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
part for you to to achieve that end

1308
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
state

1309
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,720
it's a good idea for ops and security

1310
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,599
purposes really um firstly it makes your

1311
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,839
infrastructure deployments repeatable

1312
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,520
and consistent so it's really easy for

1313
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,960
you to spin up another environment if

1314
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,240
you want to do some testing or you want

1315
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,920
to audit things

1316
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
um

1317
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
because they're code you can now review

1318
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,200
infrastructure changes as part of like a

1319
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,319
normal code review process um but you're

1320
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,920
no longer asking people to review like

1321
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,160
big bash scripts that kind of eventually

1322
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
end up having some infrastructure

1323
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,839
deployed you get them to review the

1324
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
desired end state and the tool handles

1325
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
the deployment of that for you and so

1326
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,520
it's much easier to review because

1327
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,680
you're reviewing the the what rather

1328
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,200
than the how

1329
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,640
um

1330
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,119
and because they're just code files you

1331
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,520
can run um security scanners against

1332
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,040
them you could scan for like security

1333
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,640
best practices or you can enforce your

1334
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
own rules like

1335
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,000
vms shouldn't be deployed that don't

1336
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,400
have encrypted disks or port 22 should

1337
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,839
be open to the internet and things like

1338
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,000
that

1339
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
and because you've defined that

1340
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,319
preferred end state you can also use

1341
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,319
tools to enforce that in your deployment

1342
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,319
so if you have a maybe like a product

1343
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,119
that you've deployed and a dev goes in

1344
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,119
and makes changes to how that deployment

1345
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,720
is done you can have tooling that

1346
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,560
constantly inspects your deployed state

1347
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
your desired state and undoes the

1348
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,000
changes that they've made to make sure

1349
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,359
that you always know exactly what

1350
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,720
configuration you have deployed

1351
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,119
um so onto infrastructure and

1352
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,800
particularly cloud infrastructure since

1353
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,560
that's where most companies are heading

1354
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,839
it's quite reasonable that you might end

1355
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,839
up working somewhere and that only has

1356
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,119
cloud infrastructure where all of their

1357
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,400
infrastructure is in public clouds

1358
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,359
um

1359
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,839
i'm going to focus on aws as your google

1360
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,119
cloud because that's probably what

1361
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,040
you're going to end up using

1362
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,400
um but don't forget about the kind of

1363
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
more niche clouds like digit lotion or

1364
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
heroku or oracle

1365
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,319
um

1366
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,160
first challenge is to work out what

1367
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,680
clouds you're actually using which is

1368
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,160
harder than it sounds um a really good

1369
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,760
place to start for this is the finance

1370
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,440
team or whoever pays the bills and does

1371
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,800
the invoices

1372
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,480
um because they'll be able to tell you

1373
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,640
what clouds your company is paying for

1374
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,079
and who's expensing them to help you

1375
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,920
find out who the account owners are and

1376
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,160
get access to them to secure them

1377
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,400
um also another tip is that if you've

1378
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,839
got quite a kind of sprawling cloud

1379
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,480
estate and you have a lot of accounts um

1380
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,319
account managers for the cloud provider

1381
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,960
like aws can usually help you to find

1382
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,319
all of the accounts that are registered

1383
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,079
with like your works domain and that

1384
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,920
will help you get a better view of what

1385
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,640
you have as well

1386
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,280
then once you're in the the best way to

1387
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,880
actually identify everything you have

1388
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,160
across all your regions and all your

1389
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,240
services is to use the billing

1390
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,800
functionality and most providers make it

1391
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,640
quite hard to get like a full overview

1392
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,000
of all the infrastructure you have

1393
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,599
across different regions and things like

1394
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,480
that

1395
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,720
um so usually the only

1396
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,599
kind of

1397
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,400
true

1398
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,319
um consistent place that you can find

1399
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,240
out everything you're using is in like

1400
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,319
the build pdf which could be like a 200

1401
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,040
page pdf from from aws but it at least

1402
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
lets you see kind of how much you're

1403
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,960
spending and what locations and it lets

1404
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,640
you prioritize based on on that

1405
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,119
um another piece of really invaluable

1406
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,280
cloud tooling is cloud security posture

1407
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
management

1408
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
or cspm tools

1409
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,680
so

1410
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,200
these get connected to cloud accounts

1411
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
and monitor the configuration of all

1412
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,960
your resources um in accordance with

1413
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,040
like best practices

1414
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,640
they can either be taken from standards

1415
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,160
like the cis benchmarks that i mentioned

1416
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,599
during the start

1417
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,359
um or they can be rules that you've

1418
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,359
defined for your own environment

1419
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,119
and basically these give you a single

1420
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,040
dashboard where you can view exposure

1421
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,640
status and risks across all of your

1422
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
cloud accounts in one place so they're

1423
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
really valuable and some of the more

1424
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
advanced and usually expensive tools can

1425
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,599
also automate the remediation and fixing

1426
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,960
issues that they find as well so you

1427
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
could say that across all of my aws

1428
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,000
environments

1429
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,079
port 22 for ssh should never be open to

1430
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,920
the internet um and you can have tooling

1431
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,000
that will wait to see one that is and

1432
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,680
immediately just close it again as well

1433
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,799
so it's kind of like the infrastructure

1434
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,720
as well as having cspm tooling you

1435
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
should take advantage of the cloud

1436
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,480
provider's own native security tooling

1437
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,319
as well

1438
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,280
so while cspm usually focuses on

1439
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,200
like configuration the native tooling

1440
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,720
can focus on threat detection and

1441
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,800
runtime things

1442
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,160
through behavior because they get

1443
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,000
visibility into metrics or logs or

1444
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,599
telemetry that's not kind of available

1445
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,359
to you or other products out with the

1446
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,960
cloud provider

1447
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,240
um

1448
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,760
so the types of tools i'm talking about

1449
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,200
are things like aws guard duty or um

1450
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,280
security command center uh on google

1451
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,359
cloud um depending on the cloud and what

1452
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,960
your state looks like they can be quite

1453
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,800
expensive but they also provide a really

1454
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,680
valuable level um of insight into what's

1455
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,960
happening in your environment the kind

1456
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
of behavioral threat detection type

1457
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,359
piece so

1458
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,680
these work by essentially processing and

1459
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,240
collating logs from from all across your

1460
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,760
environment and dns logs um

1461
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,440
user activity logs across the cloud

1462
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,079
provider um and hypervisor telemetry as

1463
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,920
well and this gets fed in and it gets

1464
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,400
combined with um iocs from a whole bunch

1465
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
of security vendors usually

1466
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,280
um

1467
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,119
and the scale of data that these tools

1468
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,800
are processing across like all of a

1469
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,119
cloud provider's accounts um

1470
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,560
means that they're quite capable of

1471
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,319
detecting patterns that are affecting

1472
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,000
kind of distinct customers that you

1473
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,440
wouldn't see yourself if you were just

1474
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,040
looking at your own estate

1475
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,720
um and the volume of data they collect

1476
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,160
means their machine learning detections

1477
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,200
are usually quite accurate as well

1478
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,319
so they do the kind of things you would

1479
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,160
expect they can detect like malware

1480
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,480
brute force attempts or the exfiltration

1481
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,160
by looking at the network in the dns

1482
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,119
logs and uvms and things like that

1483
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,040
um but they can also employ some kind of

1484
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,720
other methods that are quite interesting

1485
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
and not something that you would be able

1486
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,880
to build yourself or using non-native

1487
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,240
tooling

1488
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,800
so guard duty for example in aws

1489
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,839
aws can monitor for api credentials that

1490
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,240
are created in your account but then

1491
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,160
used in another account somewhere else

1492
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
um which can be an indicator that

1493
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,960
there's kind of been some kind of

1494
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,559
credential theft and your credentials

1495
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,319
have been used by someone else

1496
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,599
and

1497
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,960
google cloud they announced the thing

1498
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,680
just on monday and they built a way to

1499
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,440
use their threat detection tooling to

1500
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,760
detect cryptocurrency mining

1501
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,079
on a vm without having any presence on

1502
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,839
the vm or without actually looking at

1503
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,200
the network traffic or anything it's

1504
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,680
purely by looking at hypervisor metrics

1505
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
and so kind of the underlying

1506
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,800
infrastructure

1507
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,000
that runs their servers they can detect

1508
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,119
the patterns that indicate

1509
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,440
cryptocurrency mining um

1510
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,520
without having access to the processes

1511
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,960
without having any visibility into the

1512
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,319
memory or the network traffic or

1513
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,800
anything um so it's a really powerful

1514
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,880
piece of tech to have access to

1515
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,440
so

1516
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,640
obviously you don't want to have all

1517
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
your cloud infrastructure directly sat

1518
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,760
on the internet so anyone can access

1519
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,440
if you've already got vpn in place it

1520
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,839
gives you like a static ip to exit from

1521
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,079
um it's a totally sound strategy to

1522
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,880
restrict your your cloud

1523
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
infrastructure to have access only to

1524
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,839
that ip

1525
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,599
if you're going to do this make sure you

1526
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,599
enforce the fa it's really important to

1527
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,920
keep your vpn box patched and don't

1528
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,520
forget to remove user accounts from it

1529
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,160
when people leave as well

1530
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,599
but i will say that's not the best

1531
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,000
option to deploy now if you don't have

1532
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,520
anything in place at the moment and

1533
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
there's a few reasons for that

1534
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,079
so vpn providers don't have a great

1535
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,200
track record um at security and this is

1536
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
a really critical device for security so

1537
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,760
in in the last year alone um

1538
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
fortinet f5 pulse secure palo alto all

1539
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,200
the major vendors for this um have had

1540
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
really serious problems with the with

1541
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,960
their vpn

1542
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
products and these are really heavily

1543
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,040
exploited by actors of kind of all skill

1544
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,920
levels and it's quite it's quite common

1545
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,960
to see this um they're also not great if

1546
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,160
you're a small company that's fully

1547
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,520
remote if your staff are quite

1548
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,839
geographically distributed um

1549
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,040
realistically you're probably going to

1550
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
end up needing to deploy multiple vpn

1551
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
boxes in different countries um which is

1552
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,040
really quickly kind of balloons and

1553
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,359
multiplies the cost and maintenance and

1554
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,040
budgets for them

1555
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,640
and then finally

1556
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,200
the the kind of operating model of a vpn

1557
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,400
kind of just isn't really that good

1558
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,640
anymore uh it creates a gateway where

1559
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,319
basically once you've authenticated with

1560
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,160
it anything behind that is fair game

1561
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,680
you've authenticated once you've kind of

1562
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,119
got access you're behind the castle

1563
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,680
walls at that point

1564
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,800
but nowadays you should really be

1565
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
looking to control and restrict access

1566
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,880
on on a more granular level which is

1567
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,520
where the alternative comes in

1568
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,559
um

1569
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,079
the alternative is kind of at the peak

1570
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,839
of its hype cycle right now so there's

1571
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,640
some truly insane vendor marketing um

1572
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
about it but as long as you just kind of

1573
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
dig through it um there's some really

1574
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,559
solid options available in the

1575
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,200
in the space um essentially the idea is

1576
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
that instead of authenticating once and

1577
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,040
getting access to everything

1578
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,119
like a vpn does nothing is trusted by

1579
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,720
default so every request gets

1580
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,359
authenticated and users and devices need

1581
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,960
to authenticate themselves to your

1582
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,480
identity provider

1583
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,680
and

1584
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,359
before they're allowed to do anything at

1585
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,880
all um

1586
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,559
i'm using cloudflare as an example here

1587
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,599
because they've got a particularly

1588
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,359
mature offering but the kind of concepts

1589
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,240
apply

1590
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,040
regardless of vendor

1591
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,640
the kind of identity broker that you

1592
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,880
pick um authenticates you like you'd

1593
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,119
expect but then it can also check things

1594
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,240
like whether your device is fully

1595
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,680
patched and whether you have up-to-date

1596
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,960
anti-malware um and things like that

1597
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,359
um so basically we've gone from the vpn

1598
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,200
model of you're allowed because you're

1599
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,040
coming from the right place and to

1600
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,880
making a decision using multiple

1601
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,720
different pieces of evidence and making

1602
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,079
a dynamic decision about whether to

1603
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,640
approve or deny based on that context so

1604
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,000
if you're going to bring in some kind of

1605
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,280
secure networking solution to a

1606
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,720
high-tech company

1607
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,480
this is definitely a reasonably early

1608
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,079
stages technology that's worth looking

1609
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,480
at introducing

1610
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,200
so to begin wrapping up um

1611
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,720
use the things i mentioned here as the

1612
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,720
basis to create your own security

1613
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
roadmap for the problems that your

1614
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
organization has and

1615
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,319
you're there to be the expert so it's on

1616
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,920
you to work out what's actually needed

1617
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,000
and what's a nice to have and you want

1618
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,280
to be sure that you can justify

1619
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,559
everything on your roadmap in a way

1620
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,839
where it makes sense to the

1621
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,880
business you want to work out who can

1622
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,160
sign off on it who's going to have you

1623
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,839
the money to pay for it and which might

1624
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,119
not always be the same person so you

1625
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,400
should be prepared to have like a few

1626
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,040
rounds of kind of reprioritization and

1627
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,559
iterating to get to a state where

1628
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,000
everyone's happy with it

1629
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,359
and then finally once you've got it

1630
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,720
signed off make sure that you

1631
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
communicate openly um to everyone who

1632
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
could be affected by it um

1633
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,160
hopefully you'll have a lot in there

1634
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,599
that's come from solving other team's

1635
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:58,880
problems and people will be happy with

1636
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,680
it and but it helps adoption and it

1637
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,200
helps people be on board if you're

1638
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,559
transparent about what you're doing and

1639
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,000
why you're doing it

1640
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,160
because for for most people it's easier

1641
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,000
for them to support it if you do so

1642
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
so finally um

1643
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,680
make sure that everything you're

1644
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,280
thinking about doing you consider in the

1645
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,680
context of your business not every cyber

1646
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,839
crisis is truly going to have an impact

1647
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,760
on what you're doing and so make sure

1648
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,359
you don't go too hardcore too quickly

1649
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,800
take care of the basics and have a

1650
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
strong foundation to build up

1651
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
if you're proposing new controls or

1652
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,839
things that need money spent um you have

1653
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,040
to be able to explain the business

1654
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,800
impact of that it's not enough to say

1655
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,160
that you want to roll out uv keys

1656
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,480
because it's good for security and you

1657
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,440
need to be able to explain the

1658
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,520
consequences of not doing that what

1659
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
impacts it could have

1660
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,960
and and why that would impact the

1661
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,000
continued success of your organization

1662
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
and then finally put users at the center

1663
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,240
of everything that you do

1664
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,559
um don't you like idiots don't tell them

1665
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,079
no every time they be they ask to be

1666
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,760
able to do something because if you do

1667
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,119
they won't stop doing bad things they'll

1668
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,680
just stop telling you about um your job

1669
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,359
isn't to be the kind of master keeper of

1670
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,960
everything that's secure or not is to

1671
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,880
enable everybody else to do their job in

1672
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,680
the most secure way

1673
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,440
that's me thanks very much

1674
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,400
[Applause]

1675
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,160
i think we have very brief time for

1676
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,280
questions

1677
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,960
yeah

1678
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,000
it do you um any benchmarking security

1679
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,880
capabilities

1680
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,520
great set of questions um so the first

1681
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,760
part was about um do you benchmark your

1682
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,400
security team's capabilities um

1683
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,160
and the second part i've already

1684
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,599
forgotten it was about how did you

1685
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
prioritize it

1686
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,960
yeah um

1687
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,640
not yet um

1688
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,000
like i say that's that's kind of

1689
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,960
something that is a more more mature

1690
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,359
process than where we are right now

1691
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,800
so yeah that's something that you'd like

1692
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,920
to get to but we're not here
