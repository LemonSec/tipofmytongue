we're gonna try and keep this short and

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
sweet because real estate will just want

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
to get absolutely drunk just completely

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
slaughtered um but first off i'd like to

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
have a few thank you so first off thank

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
you volunteers who be around in the

yellow t-shirts all over the back

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,800
and without them we would not have been

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,760
able to do any of this

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
another another thank you goes out to

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
all the sponsors again without any of

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
them none of this could have happened we

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
could not put on an event to this

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
size scale caliber nothing in one of

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,640
those nights so they're the ones who

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
really make this event happen

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,760

talks and giving us access to the regs

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,119

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,560
and again couldn't have done it without

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,280

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
after a drink

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,759

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
a nice little shirt

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,240
um and finally we've got a couple of

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
just

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
other shout outs just to give um some

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
people throughout the day the first one

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
goes out to lucas

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
um

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
who hates me right now but basically

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
lucas stepped up and organized a bunch

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
of volunteers and we were dealing with

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
other things and without them again we

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
would have been in a much worse position

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,199
we've also got kyle uh who stepped up

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,800
when we had found out one of our

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
speakers in ukraine

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
and that was

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
a fun um

133
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
master the peers sent me yes and then

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
also again trooper without keeper none

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
of this would have been able to happen

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
or at least recording and streaming as

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,639
well so can we give them all a big round

138
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,720
of applause

139
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
cool and on that note we can all go to

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
the pub and um there's a nice big bart

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
out there so everyone go and enjoy and

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,799
