1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
um

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,520
secure works so normally i'm talking to

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,639
people who might want to buy our

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,000
services so i'm saying how should you

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,519
defend your company and all the rest of

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,280
that kind of stuff and this morning i

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
suddenly thought nope the audience is

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,640
different today so i've kind of

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,880
thrashed together a very different deck

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
you can all vote and tell me later if

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
it's rubbish or not but i'm going to

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
give it my best shot okay

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
so secure works um we're a security

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
company we do 1 400 instant response

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,079
engagements a year we have 4 500

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
networks that we protect on a 24x7 basis

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
every year or last year my team

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,200
captured 90 million observations from

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
our botnet emulation frameworks which

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
i'll cover in a minute

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,360
um three trillion security events a week

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
or a day i need to double check that one

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
and we have nine petabytes of data

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,600
in the way back engine that we could

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,079
search when we find new bad stuff

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,440
um me i'm i'm old i've been doing this

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,719
stuff for a very long time um i've been

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
uh my first cyber security incident was

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,240
at harriet watt back in um

30
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,159
1991. i i'm the global intel lead for

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,760
secure works

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
and i'm also the chair of the strategic

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,799
cyber industry group at the national

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,159
crime agency

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,040
um

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
all mistakes in this deck are mine all

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,119
the good stuff is this awesome team that

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,080
i have

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
working for me

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
lots of really experienced people who've

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
worked in really interesting places

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
there's an old film called local hero

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,159
and in it fulton mackay says is asked

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,759
what's the most interesting thing that's

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,320
turned up on the beach camistaric uh

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
near rsage and he says there's something

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
interesting every day well this week

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
it was comte weeks

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
imagine you just uh decide that you're

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
gonna side with russia at the time when

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,920
no same person is gonna side with russia

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
you bottle it slightly you change your

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,720
update um but it's not enough and i'm

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,119
sure we've all seen um the leaks coming

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,200
so what does secureworks do when stuff

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,280
like this happens you know

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
i mean

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
when it's not people like sean and keith

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,640
that are actually doing the hard work

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
actually

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,679
well in this case we grabbed all the

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
data we ingested it into one of our data

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,840
science platforms you should all

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
recognize this as just elastic

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
and we started to kind of

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
look through the data

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
and we set up some teams channels and

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
started to chat

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
so what sort of things could we discover

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
from the conti leaks data

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
so here is one example of of what it

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
told us just one small example there's

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,200
loads of stuff on twitter

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
this is a screenshot actually of of my

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
team's instance from earlier today

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
we have a whole bunch of botnet

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,519
emulation frameworks python scripts that

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,720
pretend to be the malware that

79
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
participate in real time in the bot nets

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
and then any changes they see are web

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,959
hooked and popped into teams and data

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,239
goes into our threat intelligence

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
management system so this story is about

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
something relating to observations from

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
our botnet emulation frameworks um and

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
how it relates to contour leaks and

87
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,879
there you can see just from this

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
afternoon um some new maldots coming

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
down from from emma tech

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
so this is a story of trick bot here's a

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
trick bought c2 configs

92
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
being delivered

93
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
and here is a trickbot c2 config and at

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
the top you can see my screen is very

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,599
small here so i can't see but you can

96
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
see the version number up there i think

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
it's in the ten thousands at the top

98
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,159
uh and then suddenly you can see this

99
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
update for trick bot

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
where um the c2 servers are all set to

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
0.0.0.0

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
and you'll also notice that there's a

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
very big number

104
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,799
in the in the in the index at the top

105
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
left so someone had managed to inject a

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
fake update into the c2 updates in

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
tripod and that sequence number which is

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
a bit like the sequence number on you

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,239
know dns zone file or whatever they'd

110
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,920
set that to the maximum it could

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
possibly be so no one could create a

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
fresher one uh and update it and lots of

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
people said well this this might have

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
been um the military

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
so

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
what our conti leak is telling us and

117
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
interestingly as you see what's our

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
consulate's telling us about um

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,040
about trick bot

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
so this is probably too small to see so

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
the pots have been flooded with such a

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,320
conflict that will simply work idle

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,759
after some time they will download the

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
new conflict by emerging coin but they

125
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
will not be able to fly this config

126
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
because the saboteur uploaded the config

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,400
with a maximum number and the bot checks

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
the config number then we've got another

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
complaint here whoever made this crap

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
did it very well he knew how the bot

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,320
works perhaps saw the source reversed it

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160
he had an encoder in a private key plus

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
he uploaded it all to the admin panel

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
and this is you probably can't see this

135
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
text unfortunately it's all from someone

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
called stern

137
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
um

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
and then here you have a final update

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
later on that evening

140
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
forgot to pay for the anchor domain and

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
as a result we're trying to knew it was

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
abused and we probably up the

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
boss

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
um

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
so they

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
this is conti leaks talking about losing

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
access to trick bot

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,479
back in september

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,440
um 2020.

150
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
so what can we deduce from that is that

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
because they were working together who

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
is stern so what else did we do with the

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
conti leaks data

154
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
well we ingested it into um our

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
intelligence management system this is a

156
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
bit like multigo except it's a multi in

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
fact it's more like palantir if you've

158
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,880
heard of pound here we used to use

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
palantir but we stopped using pound here

160
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
because it was rubbish and started using

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
this which is made by a company called

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
rip jar

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
and you can see from this graph that

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
there's a node on the left this is comms

165
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
so this is the graph of communications

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
in the leaks

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,919
somewhat summarized and you can see that

168
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,880
this node on the far left is clearly

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
communicating a lot and of course it's

170
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,759
stern so stern isn't some floater on the

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
edge of conti he's right at the heart of

172
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
it and he's the one complaining about

173
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
losing access to trickbot and this is a

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
slightly different view because you may

175
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
know the conti leaks has come out in

176
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
different tranches so that's what my

177
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
screenshot just did about 20 minutes ago

178
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
and again at the bottom right

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,919
that's stern he's a core member of the

180
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
group just from the the mesh of

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
communications

182
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
so we can conclude

183
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,000
that oh

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
you can tell i've done these slides just

185
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
now that um conti and trickbot are the

186
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
same group trick ball was the evolution

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
of dire some of you may know that um so

188
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
it's all pretty messy

189
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,720
if we go back to that takedown attempt

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
where they wounded

191
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
in september 2020. so what you can see

192
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
here is a list of instant response

193
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
engagements riot brad bragg the first

194
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
one starts in um august 2018.

195
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
there's no initial infection vector

196
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
outlined um

197
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,919
against all of the riots because

198
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
every single riot was preceded by

199
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,199
trekbot every riot we ever saw in riots

200
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
of the post-intrusion ransomware family

201
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,680
was preceded by checkbot in fact

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
better than that every one of them was

203
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,039
preceded by a checkbot that used a

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
particular module and the net bios name

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,479
of the computer connecting to that

206
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,840
reverse connect module was always

207
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,360
pc123456 um

208
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
then we see the kante coming over so

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
kante was the evolution of rioc and we

210
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,039
can see that the initial infection

211
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,720
vector varies again you might not be

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
able to read it but there's there's

213
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,919
volume exploitation there's password

214
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,520
spray there's a whole lot of different

215
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
things going on here you can basically

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,960
just fuzz your eyes and that text at the

217
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
bottom right is entropy

218
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
um

219
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,960
when was a takedown

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
that's when the trigger disruption was

221
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
so we moved from a very consistent

222
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
playbook

223
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
and then immediately after we have two

224
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
or three riots but we the average dwell

225
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
time from flash to bang from initial

226
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,639
intrusion to encryption for riot was 30

227
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,520
days

228
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,479
um

229
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
and suddenly we've got entropy

230
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,879
in the playbook so i think trickbot was

231
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
wounded in september 2020.

232
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
the big question was did it help anyone

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,479
we went from having a very deterministic

234
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
playbook that the actor was using

235
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
that we could identify we could trigger

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
on we could detect

237
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
to

238
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
a much more random playbook and many

239
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
many different initial infection vectors

240
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
so maybe

241
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
that takedown attempt didn't actually

242
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
help the world at large and then of

243
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
course

244
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,879
i don't know was it yesterday or the day

245
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
before suddenly we've got trick pot

246
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
leaks and these guys are being

247
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
thoroughly doxed um

248
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
of course this morning the account was

249
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,960
suspended

250
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
everyone who is an amateur russian

251
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
person should remember that the way back

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,000
engine is their friend um but anyway um

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
they set up another account and there's

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
lots of leaks still coming

255
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,039
on the tripod emulator feed this week so

256
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,958
there's an example from again the text

257
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
is probably too small to read i'm used

258
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
to bigger screens

259
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
that's showing hashes of new modules

260
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
coming down in december for trickbot

261
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
this is the feed for this week and you

262
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
can see if you were to look back up

263
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
you'd see the number of live c2s was

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
just

265
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
decaying exponentially and then finally

266
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
that these two updates which are from

267
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,120
wednesday are given a number of seconds

268
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
since our last live c2 has been seen

269
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,959
trick bot

270
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
is dead since wednesday

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
an old friend that's been with us um for

272
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,160
years

273
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
so we've got one organized criminal gang

274
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
responsible for riot conte chickbot dyer

275
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,399
and i haven't given you the reason why

276
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,880
but also possibly emma

277
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
which i'm sure you'll find

278
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
somebody tom brewster or brian krebs or

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
someone will be talking about this in

280
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,519
the next few days if they aren't already

281
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,880
um

282
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
and here we have another large ocg in

283
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
russia the jacobits mob and this guy has

284
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
been indicted multiple times

285
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
over 10 years there's a little map of

286
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
him and his friends in our intelligence

287
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,320
management system there's a great video

288
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
made by the people who did the

289
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,800
production at his wedding um so you can

290
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,519
find it um it's golf club not gold club

291
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,640
you can find that on the internet and

292
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
watch it and you'll notice that the

293
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
groom's face never appears

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
um in any of the videos

295
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
there's this little screenshot here and

296
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
i look at that and i wonder if i've just

297
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
spent the last five years of my life

298
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
fighting these um these guys with a

299
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
champagne um

300
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
in that video there's a picture of the

301
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
wedding party

302
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
and um you'll notice a couple of

303
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
very similar gentlemen sitting in the

304
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,519
front row

305
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
if you focus on the one on the right

306
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
i think you will agree if this screen is

307
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
up to it but this is the same same chat

308
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,760
um

309
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,079
and this is edward bendersky

310
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,360
bellingcat famous for lots of reasons um

311
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
identifying the fact of the russian shot

312
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
down mh17

313
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
um identifying the skripal poisoners and

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
everything else they put out this report

315
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
on the assassination of a georgian

316
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
asylum seeker in berlin and in it

317
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,040
they're talking about the handler of the

318
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
assassin was this guy edward mandersky

319
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
the chap i just showed you a picture of

320
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,120
it says ponderski is also the

321
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,480
father-in-law of max and jacob it's

322
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
fbi's most wanted hacker with a five

323
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,120
million dollar bout in his head um

324
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
and later on in the report it says

325
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
when we reached out to edward manderski

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
he told her partner publication that he

327
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,440
had never heard of who was familiar with

328
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,839
krasikov yet they phoned him on the

329
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
phone number

330
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
that they had from the metadata that had

331
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
called the assassin during the time

332
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,320
so

333
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
two very large ocgs

334
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
um

335
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,079
and actually just stopped saying ocg

336
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
because everyone thinks it's cliched now

337
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,519
because of that tv program organized

338
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
criminal gang um

339
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
that are responsible for the vast

340
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,079
majority of e-crime um

341
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,240
that's uh that's going on out there and

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,079
we've been saying it for years is he

343
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,240
crime a spotty kid in a hoodie no

344
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
it's serious people um staying in

345
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
office blocks in moscow and as alex who

346
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
works for me just being this trailer fed

347
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
police says um

348
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
it's the same 200 guys chasing the same

349
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
200 guys as it was 10 years ago

350
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
melon carter and conti leaks once more

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
um bellycat themselves have been a

352
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
target for a long time

353
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,920
so

354
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
eric toler received received the fish

355
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
saying there's been a a sign in on

356
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
on google apps for you

357
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
uh elliot higgins who's uh gmail account

358
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
brown moses um got the same kind of uh

359
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,079
fish

360
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,200
come in

361
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
and they shared those with us

362
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,760
years ago when we were tracking all the

363
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
fishes that a group we call iron

364
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
twilight that you guys maybe know as

365
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
fancy bear um we're creating um uh

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
fishes and targeting lots of people

367
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
um

368
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,519
i've said it already you may recognize

369
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
bellingcat that's

370
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
the guys that uncovered the scribble

371
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
poisoners

372
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
secure snare and twilight well we saw

373
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
that the bad guys were using bitly links

374
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
short links um to encode the urls and

375
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,240
fishes

376
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
and the victim email address for the

377
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,360
fish was base64 encoded in the url so we

378
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
could just set up a script and harvest

379
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
all the bitly links bitly's api was open

380
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
at the time and build a database of all

381
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
the people that the russians were

382
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
targeting and we published that stuff

383
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,600
um on our blog we harvested and a half

384
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,760
thousand bitly urls

385
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
seven thousand email accounts the seven

386
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
thousand email email accounts were all

387
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
people that would be interest to someone

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
who was interested in the russian year

389
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
abroad in nato

390
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
and basically you could look at the

391
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
target list and say

392
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
who is interested in people like this

393
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
and you would immediately draw the

394
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
conclusion it was the gru in russia

395
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
and then you'd ask yourself who could

396
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
create if you wanted to false flag this

397
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,279
a credible list of targets of 7000

398
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
people and you'd be

399
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
you need you need to be a large

400
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
intelligence agency so that's the first

401
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
data point in terms of attribution for

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,399
the dmc attacks one that's often missed

403
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
the second one is that these 20 000

404
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
bitly urls were created according to

405
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
this time histogram

406
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,519
which is mostly from 9 a.m to 6 p.m

407
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,000
moscow time that's a nice little

408
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,279
attribution thing

409
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,360
and then remember the gre is russian

410
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
military intelligence and in april 2016

411
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
our bitly data told us that they were

412
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,320
creating links

413
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,519
every day

414
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
in april 2016

415
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,199
except for

416
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,639
the 15th of april now the secured guys

417
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
know what happened on the 15th of april

418
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
the 15th of april is the russian day of

419
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
electronic fight troops public holiday

420
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,440
do you think if you are in russian

421
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
military intelligence and you're a

422
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
hacker that you are a radio electronic

423
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
fighter trump might think this is a 400

424
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
pound guy sitting in his bed i've just

425
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
given you three data points to tell you

426
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,319
that was russian

427
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
we also collect a lot from incident

428
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
response ransomware is the biggest deal

429
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
that we deal with it's

430
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,479
it's bad when an

431
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
year our ir organizat of which we have

432
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,959
two members over there

433
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
um

434
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
74

435
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
post intrusion ransomware incidents

436
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
worked by our teams enterprises have

437
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,519
been completely knocked offline we've

438
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
done 269 in the last four years

439
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
it's a complete mess

440
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
you ran some weird and then there's lots

441
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
of tripwires that you can pick up i

442
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
won't focus on the detail here but this

443
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
is one single incident where um

444
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,199
they'd left rdp exposed to the internet

445
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,920
they were not using multi-factor off

446
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
they weren't seeing things like

447
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
bloodhound and uh and mummy cats

448
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,839
um

449
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
they didn't catch people executing

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
nastiness with powershell they didn't

451
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
detect cobalt strike

452
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,680
and then they didn't detect abnormal

453
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
activity by administrative users classic

454
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
red team classic post intrusion

455
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
ransomware actor the key thing here is

456
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
if we look at our data set for last year

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
um the mean flash the bang from initial

458
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
intrusion to ransomware event is 22 days

459
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,639
all of your mathematicians out there

460
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,839
will know that the mean is badly

461
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,279
affected by outliers so let's look at

462
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,519
the median five days there are some big

463
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,000
outliers there the range is one to 111

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
but that is five days

465
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,720
when people like us and others

466
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
can actually stop this stuff the

467
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,279
detection window is small but it is

468
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
absolutely real

469
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
the hostile state actors have

470
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,279
predictable playbooks too this is a bit

471
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,800
of a laugh this one but it's very

472
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
predictable these are screenshots from

473
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,320
um

474
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
a chinese apt group

475
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
on a network that we discovered in

476
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
january it's quite a serious incident

477
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,079
actually um

478
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,839
uh yeah with the screenshot you're not

479
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,399
going to see this this is them raring up

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,600
a database

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
and then this one here you can see

482
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
what i regard as the classic chinese

483
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
ping minus n1 i was a unix systems

484
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
administrator for most of my life

485
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
i never typed ping my name one that's

486
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
like four extra characters so um you can

487
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
kind of measure that you know what did

488
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
sean connery say in the film

489
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
give me a ping just one and then we can

490
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,440
go and find the chinese last year we had

491
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
a chinese actors doing ping minus n3 and

492
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,959
my entire team said i was gonna have to

493
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,920
change my presentations

494
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
then we've got supernova so uh sunburst

495
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,240
supernova oh solarwinds all that jazz

496
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,679
safari came out with their initial

497
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
report and a git repo and in it they

498
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
included a web shell

499
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,839
microsoft came out about a week later

500
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,000
and said not sure why that web shell was

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,640
in

502
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
uh manhattan's report because it's got

503
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,480
nothing to do with russia it's chinese

504
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
so that was all very interesting

505
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,439
we then had found that web shell on a

506
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,799
customer

507
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,760
which is quite interesting we also had

508
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
an earlier intrusion on the same client

509
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
um a compromise of a volume and manage

510
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
engine and all that other good stuff

511
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,520
um

512
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
the key thing about this one though um

513
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,480
yeah we blocked this you can read it um

514
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
is that the bad guys in this case

515
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
grabbed our endpoint agent red cloak and

516
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
installed it in their own data center so

517
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,600
suddenly we had a phone home

518
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,240
from an ip address in china

519
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
and before it managed to return its

520
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,960
collection they'd realized it and

521
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
switched it off so we put that in the

522
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
blog post and we thought the entirety of

523
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,039
twitter would go bonkers over you know

524
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
what was that data center in china and

525
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
and who was running and all the rest of

526
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,080
it the only person who spotted it was

527
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
malware tech um so it was a bit

528
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
disappointing because i thought we'd get

529
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
this kind of crowdsourced who's that ip

530
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,559
address thing

531
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
anyway all that is examples of things

532
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
that we collect we collect

533
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
lots of things ridiculous quantities of

534
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
things and my team's job is to make

535
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
sense of it all as i said earlier we've

536
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
invested a lot in a system that allows

537
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
us to make sense of it it has workflows

538
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,000
that we can use to create repeated

539
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,120
playbooks

540
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
whenever we find something interesting

541
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
we create little investigations we have

542
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
nice reacts that allow us to search all

543
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,200
the things we can quickly ingest

544
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
indicators we've got a romanian sock

545
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,760
with 400 people in it they use this so

546
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,919
when they see a fish they drop it in

547
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
once we know it's bad we kind of

548
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
crystallize this threat graph we publish

549
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
it into this other little database we

550
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,840
call knowledge which is then consumed by

551
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,160
our systems and one example which you

552
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
can see

553
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,200
of that data it's exposed of a rest api

554
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,799
and we've published the rosetta stone

555
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,120
the threat groups on our

556
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,039
website which is not static it's coming

557
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
directly from that threat intelligence

558
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
management system that same system

559
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
captures all the botnet emulation system

560
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
we've got a

561
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
kind of scheduler where we could put

562
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
patterns in that can find new

563
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,160
infrastructure that bad guys are doing

564
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
each of the little

565
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
blobs here these tiny little blobs of

566
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
which there's several hundred is an

567
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
incident response engagement where we've

568
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,799
collected all the details of what we're

569
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
seeing and then we've published that in

570
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
a knowledge browser so people can sift

571
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,919
it and work out what we know about the

572
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,360
bad guy

573
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
so

574
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
this is how we work

575
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,679
it's not

576
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,679
vulners it's not

577
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,400
powershell and exploits and interpreter

578
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,520
and all that

579
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
it's sort of a bit like id and process

580
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
it might sadden you and make you think

581
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
it's it it's it's boring but it's really

582
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
important to have your data structured

583
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
know where it is be able to get access

584
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,200
to it to make sense of it and this is

585
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,520
just a wee example um

586
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,919
forex fuel system.com a journalist

587
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,520
raphael sater reuters rang me up and

588
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
said what do we know about it he knew

589
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,400
what we knew about it because we

590
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
published a blog post on it's just a

591
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
slightly artificial example but you know

592
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,559
i can pivot off that i can see oh we've

593
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,159
written a threat intelligence product i

594
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,679
can see that it's linked to some other

595
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,200
domains and it's linked to a chinese

596
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,039
threat group i can then traverse a

597
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,480
little bit more and find out it's linked

598
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
to more things and i can read what we

599
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
wrote about that threat group in our

600
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,600
published threat intelligence i could

601
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,799
have done the daft thing and said give

602
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,080
me all the hashes give me all the ip

603
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,919
addresses and i'll get a kind of

604
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,480
pavement pizza thing going on here um i

605
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,159
can go into the search app and search

606
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
client telemetry and i can get hits

607
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,200
which is unsurprising because all this

608
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
research came from a client and all

609
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,039
labels are off this graph but what you

610
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,120
can see here is process launches and

611
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,799
other things that we associate with that

612
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,120
particular domain and that threat group

613
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
on the client that was the subject of

614
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
this blog and that's what makes us

615
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
efficient because you know secureworks

616
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
has got a lot of data the research team

617
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,000
is nearly 100 people um and if we were

618
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
all just individuals doing our own thing

619
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
it wouldn't work we wouldn't have the

620
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
scale we need and of course my boss

621
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
expects me to have an answer yesterday

622
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
anytime something changes in the threat

623
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
landscape so we've got kind of real

624
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
world outcomes there from the system

625
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
this is one simple example

626
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
incident response there was a this is

627
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,000
the dark side group um the guys that did

628
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
over colonial pipeline but this is a few

629
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
months pre prior to that they hit a

630
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,559
manufacturing company in the us

631
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,360
um

632
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,159
we got the instant response team engaged

633
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,480
they fed back um the cobalt strike c2

634
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
server and what you can see here is the

635
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,000
results of searches against their nine

636
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
petabytes of logs for our customers and

637
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
you can see the the red node there says

638
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,799
a customer has has communicated to that

639
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,760
ip address um more than 100 times so

640
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,039
drill into that it's a global

641
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,120
manufacturer it's a mega brand that you

642
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
would all know

643
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
and we got to them before the bad guy

644
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
was able to leverage his foothold in

645
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,240
their network

646
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,200
uh we can also um use this to enumerate

647
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
other things how do i know where all the

648
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
victims are of quackball

649
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
that's a really interesting

650
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,039
question

651
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
because nobody should know that apart

652
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
from the bad guy well we were quite

653
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
lucky last year

654
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
in that

655
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,440
our um

656
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
bits of python got promoted into being a

657
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,520
c2 server for

658
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,960
that happens if you've been around for a

659
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,120
long time so we had to write write a lot

660
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
more code we had a lot of angst because

661
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
of course we had to throw away

662
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
everything that we got because that

663
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
wouldn't be good we certainly couldn't

664
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
facil be facilitating crime

665
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,799
but we could at least enumerate where

666
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
all the connections were coming from

667
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,880
then at that time there was a lot of

668
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
problems with quackboat itself and a lot

669
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
of the c2 servers dropped off so we

670
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,679
collected

671
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
um

672
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
it in effect an inventory of all of the

673
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,919
quackbot infections worldwide

674
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,440
the other thing of course

675
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,039
that that allows us to do is we can see

676
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
the next hop back you know these e-crime

677
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,440
botnets have got multi-tier c2 interest

678
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,679
infrastructure quack belt is only too

679
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,919
hot so we were able to see after the

680
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,440
emmatec takedown

681
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
the quackbot guys moved their top left

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
top tier c2 servers

683
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,440
into moscow where they couldn't be

684
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
touched by western law enforcement and

685
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
you can't see it very clearly but there

686
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
are there is a green blob there just

687
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,159
close to the kremlin and that's where

688
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
the quackbot c2 servers the backup ones

689
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,039
are today

690
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,200
so that's just a quick rattle through i

691
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
don't know how long i've been speaking

692
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,159
for that was probably a bit quick not

693
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,760
sure um

694
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
a quick rattle through some of the

695
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,320
things that secureworks does and some of

696
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,880
the ways that that we work in terms of

697
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
marshalling data and making sense of it

698
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
at the end of the day we're not running

699
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,919
around randomly researching cool things

700
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,640
we ask ourselves who our clients are

701
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
we ask ourselves what we're protecting

702
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,760
them from

703
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
we ask ourselves have we got the data

704
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,240
that tells us the detail of what we need

705
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
to know to protect our clients

706
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,400
we grab all that data we stick it in big

707
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
systems we make sense of it and we

708
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
deploy countermeasures

709
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,159
and that's everything for me and i don't

710
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,520
know if you guys do questions or not but

711
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
i'm happy to hang around and answer any

712
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,840
questions you've got thank you

713
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,079
[Applause]

714
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
no questions

715
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,679
no

716
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,799
is that okay yeah

717
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
how has it changed

718
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
everyone has a thirst to know what's

719
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
going on

720
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
so it's

721
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
there's a slide i normally have that

722
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,279
says in infosec

723
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,080
um

724
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
there's there's an awful lot of

725
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
turbulence for very little flow

726
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,720
you know you wake up every day and you

727
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
think i've lost sight of all the changes

728
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,520
that are going on in the threat

729
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,679
landscape but if you went to sleep for a

730
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,440
year and woke up

731
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
you'd still be dealing with the same

732
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
stuff you and i were talking about it a

733
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,159
moment ago people don't know where their

734
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,840
computers are they don't keep them

735
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
patched they don't use multi-factor off

736
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,679
and bad guys are still trying to make

737
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,200
money you know

738
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
so

739
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,279
i think

740
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
that simplicity has been lost

741
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
with the rise of this time terribly so

742
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
i'm really old the rise of social media

743
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,440
the rise of instant amazon communication

744
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,960
everyone wants to know

745
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,559
you know where are the bad guys what

746
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
they're doing and in actual fact

747
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,520
everyone should be saying

748
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,799
you know we had a

749
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,480
client once that got hacked by the

750
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
chinese from a server in mexico from a

751
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
site that they didn't think they had

752
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,039
anymore you know it's like people

753
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,640
don't understand that the basics are

754
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
what's really important

755
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,520
a probably terrible answer but

756
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
it's like

757
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
cyber security-wise sorry

758
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
how do you perfect it do you think

759
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
russia is like cyberspiritus

760
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,159
uh

761
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,760
if you are in there

762
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,000
sight lines there an enormous threat

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
um

764
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
if you go back

765
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
six or seven years ago maybe longer

766
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
cheaper spending satellite tarla is just

767
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,559
the most amazing thing ever where

768
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,200
the the russians would have a c2 server

769
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
embedded in their malware

770
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
and that c2 server was located somewhere

771
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,200
generally in africa

772
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,080
where they knew that the path back to it

773
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,840
would be via satellite backhaul

774
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,320
and the c2 server itself had nothing

775
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
running on it it was just innocent and

776
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
the russians used their own passive

777
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,679
second collection of satellite

778
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,039
communications

779
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,960
to capture that and then re-inject

780
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
the reply packet from somewhere else on

781
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
the internet

782
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,679
anyone who's put

783
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,200
why would you put that level of

784
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
obfuscation into your command and

785
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,640
control because you don't want to get

786
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
caught

787
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,279
and that that's the only reason you do

788
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,000
that

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,240
anyone who can put that amount of

790
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,559
thought and detail into their

791
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,760
um framework just purely to to stymie

792
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
attribution has clearly got talent the

793
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
most complicated piece of powershell

794
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
partial implant we ever saw was russian

795
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,480
five years ago we've never seen anything

796
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
like it since they have amazing

797
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
capability

798
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,840
the difference between them and the

799
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
chinese say

800
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,640
is that

801
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
until now

802
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
they have only really ever used it for

803
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
national security objectives

804
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,639
so the svr and the dukes

805
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,120
they would only ever be going after

806
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,000
central government um the gru aren't

807
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
twilight in our lingo they were a bit a

808
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
bit more like a sort of drunken hooligan

809
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,559
but they really only were bringing their

810
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,919
capability to bear when they had a

811
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,880
mission

812
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
unlike say the chinese who are just all

813
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
over everything um

814
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
and of course iron vikings so the black

815
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,279
energy stuff in in ukraine so they have

816
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,799
the capability

817
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,399
and they have a

818
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,440
i believe a constraint on their intent

819
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
that's uh you know so if you reach the

820
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,279
caesar's current threat assessment on

821
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,559
russia they'll say

822
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,880
oh boy have they got capability but we

823
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,320
believe their threshold for using it

824
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,080
against western targets is extremely

825
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,880
high

826
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,159
um i believe that to be the case too

827
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,360
i don't know what's going to happen if

828
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,720
the sanctions start to really hurt

829
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
russia i just don't

830
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,640
and that does somewhat worry me because

831
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,520
their

832
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,440
is extraordinary they're

833
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
they're an adversary that is

834
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,919
as good as anyone else apart from five

835
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,159
eyes

836
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,240
i'm not trying to scare you i'm just

837
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,510
[Music]

838
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,360
a conflict is russia and china yeah but

839
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,640
i have no idea

840
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
i mean i have no idea

841
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
i mean

842
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,919
we see so much more of the chinese

843
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,600
because their threshold for using their

844
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
capabilities different they they use it

845
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
against people are our customers they're

846
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
stealing intellectual property all of

847
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,039
the time and then occasionally you'll

848
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
stumble across the chinese using

849
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
something which is just amazing so back

850
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
in 2012

851
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
at an ngo um

852
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,600
we discovered um skeleton key which was

853
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,760
an implant into ad just a memory patch

854
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,440
into authentication room

855
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,360
uh routines in ad

856
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
where irrespective of some account name

857
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
you gave as long as you gave this kind

858
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,120
of magic skeleton key password you could

859
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,039
get in and you know when you publish

860
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,320
stuff

861
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,760
you can kind of tell whether people have

862
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
seen it before or not and when when it's

863
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,200
governments that are coming back to you

864
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,559
know could we have a sample of that you

865
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,320
kind of know it's cool and that was the

866
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,440
chinese it was stealthy and it was used

867
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
against um a very interesting target for

868
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
the chinese so you have to think about

869
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,679
the chinese as having a tier where their

870
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
a team is very very good

871
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
um

872
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
but they've got all these people who are

873
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
just out there doing in some cases the

874
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,000
equivalent of stealing phone booths you

875
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
know just bulk data gathering from

876
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,879
healthcare and other stuff
