00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,240
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
my name is elizabeth and today i'd like

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,639
to talk to you about microsoft azure

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
sentinel blog analytics and cousteau

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,119
credit language

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,080
before we move on any views and opinions

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
expressed in this presentation are

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,439
purely my own and are based on my

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
experience and i know that there's a lot

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,640
of people who put that in their

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
presentation but it's a reason why

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,399
it's in this one and you'll find out in

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
a second

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,040
um so let's let's move on to the boring

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
part which is the part about me um i am

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
a security analyst working at quorum

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,879
cyber um i'm also in my third year of

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
graduate apprentice cyber security at

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
edinburgh university

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
the graduate apprenticeship program is a

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,039
really cool thing

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
it allows me to study and both work at

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
the same time

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
and the experience i gain in my

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
workplace counts towards my diploma

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,039
which is really cool

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
and if you'd like to find a little bit

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
more about how i joined quorum there's a

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
little blog post on our website

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
from april 2020 when i joined the

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
company um and it was a really

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
weird experience joining the company

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
during the pandemic um i still haven't

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
met majority of of people from my

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
workplace in person which is weird

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
because i worked there for like almost

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
two years

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
and there's also a separate talk that i

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,840
did in october uh 2020 about my

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
transition from being an administrator

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,720
to

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
becoming a security analyst

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,960
so if you just put my name um in youtube

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
the talk will come up

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
and if you have any questions or if

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,079
you'd like to follow me

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,320
you can find me on twitter

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,759
and if you have any questions about the

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
presentation or anything that i do feel

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,399
free to ask me

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,399
i can go off topic but there is a

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
structure there is order to this chaos

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
um what we'll do is we'll look at

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
what's a security analyst what does the

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,399
job involve

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
we'll look at the glossary of some

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,719
common terms that are very often used

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
um we'll look at what is microsoft

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
sentinel and also look at log analytics

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
and kql and how the three are connected

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,360
together

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
and then we'll talk about career paths

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
in cyber and why working in the salk

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
is a good starting point for korea

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
and if there's time there'll be a q a

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
section uh have promised that we'll make

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
it

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,360
in time but i'll do my best

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
um so for this presentation i did a

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
little bit of research i was trying to

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
find a

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
common denominator for who is a security

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,239
analyst and what does the job involve um

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,200
at quorum um my responsibilities are

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
quite flexible i'm able to work with

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,239
other teams which is really amazing

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
because that's how you learn and that's

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
how you gain new skills i was thinking

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
that maybe i'll be able to find

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,319
something that will give you a

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
definition of what a security analyst

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
and what you could expect from this role

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
um so i visited one of the most common

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,159
job sites like indeed glassdoor i read

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
total jobs only to find that all of the

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
job descriptions are totally different

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
and there's different expectations for

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
analysts in different companies and so

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,879
the job can be as simple as just

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
triaging tickets and forwarding over to

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
the relevant team

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
and also it can also be as complicated

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
as um configuring firewalls uh providing

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
incident response uh doing vulnerability

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
scans and uh offering security

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
recommendations

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
and another interesting thing is that

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
there's also no consistency in job

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
titles because you can have cloud

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
security administrator you can have

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
cyber security administrators

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,760
information security administrators then

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,599
there's also seniors and juniors and

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
they have different tiers as well so

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,519
it's all very mocked up and and there's

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
a lot of things to consider

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,720
um one of the things that um i always

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,319
find a little bit intimidating whenever

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
i start starting a new job is the amount

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
of jargon that's being used day-to-day

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,239
so usually for the first week when

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
you're attending

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
team meetings you have absolutely no

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
idea of what people are talking about

115
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,080
so in order to make this talk a little

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
bit easier for you guys i've prepared a

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
little glossary and i'll go over the

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
terms so you can get a better idea of

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
some of the things that are

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
very commonly used as observations when

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,079
talking about cyber security

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
so first thing is manage security

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
service providers so quorum cyber is a

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
managed security service provider we

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
offer different services to companies so

126
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
companies can outsource them if they

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
don't have the team or if they need to

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
provide some additional data or

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
additional help to their internal

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
in-house teams

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
then we have security operations center

132
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
which is also referred to as blue team

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
which is the defensive side of cyber

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
security and as an analyst i am part of

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,960
the sock

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,639
there's also incident response so

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
whenever activity has been

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
classified as malicious it goes over to

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
incident response and incident response

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
really tries to establish

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
the amount of damage so whether there

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,520
was any data breached whether there was

143
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
any lateral movement any servers that

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
were impact and incident response and

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
this is the part that i absolutely love

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
also tries to do a detective part of

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
investigating how the attacker got in

148
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
how the breach happened

149
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,160
and that's something that i really love

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
doing

151
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
then there's also security information

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
and event management and this is a tool

153
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
that provides real-time

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
analysis of security events

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
generated by applications or devices and

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
there's also source or

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
security orchestration automation and

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
response and this is a new creation um

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
the security information and event

160
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
management tools have been then there

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
for quite a while but the security

162
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
orchestration automation and response is

163
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
a new feature which collects the inputs

164
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
monitored by the soft some so for

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
example the cm um real-time data and

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,080
allows to define incident analysis and

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
response procedures and it also allows

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
to pull information from external threat

169
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,560
intelligence feeds to enrich the data

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
then we have endpoint detection and

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
response and

172
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
what it does is it provides real-time

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
monitoring and collection of data from

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
endpoint devices then we have ueba which

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
stands for user and entity behavior

176
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
analytics it basically looks at what is

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,240
a typical behavior for a user and

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
whether there's an anomaly you know that

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
there might be some malicious activity

180
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
obviously people are the most unstable

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
factor in any equation so there's no

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
such thing as a standard user behavior

183
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,240
but obviously you can try to establish

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
some pattern of user behavior so for

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
example the geolocation from which the

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
user is logging in device that they're

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,639
using

188
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,080
servers that they're accessing or

189
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
applications that they're using

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
then we have ids which stands for

191
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
intrusion detection system and

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
ids monitors network traffic

193
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
for signals that might indicate that an

194
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
attacker is exfiltrating or stealing

195
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
data from the network so it sits within

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
your internal network

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
ips on the other hand uh sits on the

198
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
edge of your network and it works

199
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,479
similar to a firewall between the

200
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,800
internet and between your local network

201
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
and it denies traffic based on the uh

202
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
security profile so for example if

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
there's a domain that has a really low

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
reputation that has been seen um

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
reported

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
in malicious activity ips can block

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
traffic coming to or from um that

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
particular entity

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,280
um and then we also have slas

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,199
that very often comes up in different

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
job adverts

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
that stands for service level agreement

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
um and it's an agreement to how quickly

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
uh you as an analyst or the company

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,879
needs to respond to a particular

216
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
activity obviously it's very important

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
to um

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
classify

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
the priority of different things how

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
they need to be investigated so sla

221
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
really allows you to prioritize your

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
workload and decide what needs to be

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
looked at in the first place

224
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
and last but not least and you probably

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
heard me using this observation it's kql

226
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
which is crystal query language and

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,639
we'll look in a depth of what it is and

228
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
how you can use it in a second but as

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
the name already gives it away it is a

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
query language

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,039
so what is microsoft sentinel um this is

232
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,479
a description from

233
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
microsoft

234
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,039
docs it is a scalable cloud native

235
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
security information and event

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
management and security orchestration

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
automation and response solution so

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,320
there's two of the glossary bits that we

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
covered just before and what really um

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,640
sentinel does is it allows you to

241
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
collect data from different sources to

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
collect logs from either your

243
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
on-premises environment your cloud

244
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
environment it doesn't have to be

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
microsoft cloud it can be google it can

246
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
be aws

247
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
and store it in one central place so you

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
can investigate it and you can detect

249
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,399
based on the logs that you have at hand

250
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
so there's the detection part and you

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
also

252
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,279
are able to investigate and there's also

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
an element of response so you could

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,440
automate response whenever a malicious

255
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
activity has been identified

256
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,640
so let's look a little bit closer at um

257
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
azure sentinel how you can get there so

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,080
if you browse to portal azure.com um and

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
in the search bar on the browser or

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
mobile version type sentinel you'll get

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
to the the sentinel platform and the

262
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
main page

263
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
so first of all what you need to do in

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
sentinel is start collecting data in

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
order to detect alert and investigate

266
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,000
and you can start collecting data by

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
using out-of-the-box solutions already

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
provided by microsoft in the data

269
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
connector section so

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
in the picture here you can see that

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,200
there's amazon web services connector

272
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
already available to

273
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,839
collect the data from aws there's also

274
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,160
connectors for firewall for iis sql logs

275
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,760
everything is there

276
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
that will help you to collect the data

277
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,560
effectively without doing too much of a

278
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
engineering work

279
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,839
then once we have the data there um

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,560
sentinel also has analytics which has

281
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
some rule templates to detect anomalous

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
behavior but it's not just anomalous

283
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
behavior that you're looking at very

284
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
often whenever it comes to malware

285
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
you're looking at patterns of behavior

286
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,320
so you can both alert on patterns that

287
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
might indicate malicious activity or you

288
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
can look for animalities or

289
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,240
abnormalities that would indicate that

290
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
there's some unusual behavior um

291
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,839
happening in your environment

292
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
for the rule templates available from

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
microsoft there's predefined priority

294
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,079
levels so

295
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,320
there's highs which are marked with the

296
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
red

297
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
line just next to the severity there's

298
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,959
medium slows and informational and if

299
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
you can see on the panel on your left

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
hand side there's a section which

301
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
contains a rule query this is written in

302
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
kql and it basically

303
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
establishes what is it that you're

304
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,600
looking for in the law so it establishes

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
the pattern of behavior that you're

306
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
looking for

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,600
and once there is a match for your query

308
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
alert is generated an incident is

309
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,120
generated and you can view the incidents

310
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
in the incident section

311
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
um incidents next to the incident id

312
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
have the priority level so you can

313
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
organize your workload and obviously

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
investigate the high priority ones in

315
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,920
the first case and then leave the lower

316
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
ones or the informational ones

317
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
to investigate last and in order to view

318
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,720
the full details of the alert so in

319
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
order to view the events in order to

320
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
view the entities so what

321
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
is involved in this alert ips users

322
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
devices you can click on view full

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
details

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
and another interesting thing that is

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
also available is a

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
investigation section which provides you

327
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
with this cool graph that shows you uh

328
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,880
the pattern of behavior and the uh

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
direction of the attack so you can see

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,959
any lateral movement um you can see the

331
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
user you can see the devices and you can

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
see whether there was any connection

333
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
made in between

334
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,399
and another cool thing that microsoft

335
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
also provides is entity mapping so

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
whenever you enable this feature um

337
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,279
users ips devices um are

338
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,320
mapped into one and if you access the

339
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
entity so if you click on the user if

340
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
you click on the ip it provides you with

341
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,399
this page which provides you a timeline

342
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
of all the activity related to your

343
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
entity so for example if you're looking

344
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
at a user and you have an alert for

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
unfamiliar sign-in where user signs in

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
from a device that isn't typical for

347
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,399
them and then you see an alert for a

348
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,720
mailbox forwarding rule being created

349
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,639
that can be an indication that the user

350
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
account has been compromised and an

351
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
attacker is setting up an email

352
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,560
forwarding rule to for example abuse the

353
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
user's email account to send phishing

354
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
messages and the email forwarding rule

355
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
really is there in order for the

356
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
attacker not to be detected

357
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,360
and another cool thing is the automation

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,959
that's available with sentinel so for

359
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
example whenever an alert is generated

360
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
you can post the message in teams you

361
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
can send an email to the relevant team

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,079
so they can look at it

363
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
and also if a condition is met you can

364
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
block the user or block the ip

365
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,839
or just close the alert in a relevant

366
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,200
portal which is absolutely cool

367
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
now let's take a moment to pray to the

368
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
demogods because i've decided to do an

369
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
absolutely crazy thing and show you kick

370
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
you on action

371
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
let's just hope everything goes

372
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
according to plan and there will be no

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
network issues or anything like that

374
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,480
so log analytics um

375
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,680
think about log analytics as a huge sql

376
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,000
database that contains data from the

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
different log sources whenever

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,480
you

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,639
investigate the alert in sentinel there

380
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
is an option to actually go into log

381
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,519
analytics in order to get more data

382
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,519
to investigate the activity obviously if

383
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,519
you only get an ip and only a user

384
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,360
you're not really able to establish what

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,959
is it that happened there you need more

386
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
information from the logs to get a

387
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
bigger picture

388
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
so log analytics

389
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
stores all of the data from different

390
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,800
connectors in tables and if you think

391
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
about tables you have the columns and

392
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,160
you have different cells

393
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
keep that in mind whenever we'll be

394
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
talking about kql and kql is the

395
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
language that is used to retrieve the

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,959
data

397
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
from those tables

398
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
so we as analysts can investigate the

399
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
activity we can get the correct data and

400
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
get the bigger picture of what's going

401
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,120
on

402
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,079
um kql very similar to sql very similar

403
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,399
to my sequel so if you guys had

404
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
those languages at uni you probably

405
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,079
wouldn't have any issue with learning

406
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,000
kql i would even say that it's easier

407
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
than sql from my own experience

408
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,519
the difference between the kql and

409
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
sql is that with sql you can obviously

410
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
alter the tables change the values

411
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,279
within the tables with kql you can't

412
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
change the values within the tables you

413
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
can append stuff to the tables but you

414
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
can't really change the data the logs

415
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,440
are in there which makes sense because

416
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,800
you don't want to mess with the logs you

417
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,440
want them to be intact

418
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
and kql is used for various things so i

419
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,440
showed you guys uh in the um

420
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,519
log analytics section where you created

421
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,839
the rules for the alerts uh the rule for

422
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
the alert was written in kql and you can

423
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,079
also use it to perform security

424
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
investigations so go directly into the

425
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
log analytics section and retrieve data

426
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
you can use it for troubleshooting so

427
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
i've mentioned to you guys that it also

428
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
ingests sql iis or any other application

429
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
logs so if you're in engineering if

430
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,560
you're a dev and there's an issue with

431
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
your application instead of going on to

432
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
device and looking at the logs like that

433
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
you can just go to log analytics

434
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
specify the conditions to specify what

435
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
application you're looking for what

436
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160
server what time frame and you can get

437
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,839
the logs like that

438
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,320
it's as simple and it can also be used

439
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,720
for thread hunting so for example a

440
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
block for j internet went on fire and we

441
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
used kql to basically detect any

442
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,839
activity relating to lock4j

443
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,959
vulnerability which is cool

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,160
so

445
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,680
the demo part

446
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
um let's assume a situation that we

447
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
receive an alert where an id that has

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
been listed in the threat intelligence

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
list has been seen doing something in

450
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
our environment and we need to go into

451
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,560
kql look at the activity what was the ip

452
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
doing um

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,480
why was the ip listed in the threat

454
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
intelligence list and determine whether

455
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
it's malicious or whether it's not

456
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
malicious and now the reason why we

457
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
can't just assume that this is malicious

458
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,320
is because very often whenever ips

459
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,360
first of all there's a limited number of

460
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,000
ipv4 addresses and obviously one ip can

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,959
be used if it's a web server by multiple

462
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,759
websites for example so the fact that an

463
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,519
ip has been previously seen doing

464
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,959
something malicious doesn't really mean

465
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,639
that it's doing something malicious

466
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,880
right now we need to go into the logs

467
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
get a bigger picture and understand if

468
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,839
it's really doing something bad

469
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
so we're also look at some uh free tools

470
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
that you guys can use as well um so

471
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
we'll look at threadcrowd telus

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
intelligence and abuse ib database

473
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
because it's relevant to what we'll be

474
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
doing just now

475
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,559
and

476
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,599
let's see if it'll work

477
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
let me just find my cursor

478
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,280
so first of all if we like to

479
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
look at the tables that are within this

480
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
is a microsoft demo

481
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
site you guys can access it it contains

482
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
live data so if you like to play about

483
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
with kql

484
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,799
you can go to the microsoft demo page

485
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,919
and just have a look at the data and try

486
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,880
to write some queries um so this query

487
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
this grader here um search which means

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
we're looking for something uh the

489
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
asterix is a wild card so we're looking

490
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,679
for any value and we're summarizing the

491
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
output by the name of the table

492
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
and if we run this over the last 24

493
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,879
hours

494
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,799
please work there we go there's 57

495
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,520
tables that are available in this demo

496
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
site and from the names of the tables

497
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
some of them are self-explanatory so if

498
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
it says sign-in logs it means that it

499
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,559
contains information about the silent

500
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
activity

501
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,240
there's some cube node inventory uh app

502
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
service http logs um you can have a mess

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
about if if you're interested in

504
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
learning a little bit more about kql

505
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
now i have selected an ip

506
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,840
which probably was seen 48 hours ago

507
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,640
because i've been doing this

508
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
presentation yesterday and i found a

509
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
really interesting id

510
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,200
and if we uh use the same query as we

511
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
did before we just really want to

512
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,919
replace the wild card so any

513
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,559
any data by the particular string that

514
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,200
interests us so we're looking at the ip

515
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
address in question and we can see that

516
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,880
there's uh four tables in which the ip

517
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
is present there's vm connection

518
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
your network analytics as your network

519
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,720
analytics and as your diagnostics

520
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
actually this one contains a little bit

521
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
more information as your analytics ip

522
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
details there we go

523
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
so we want to look at the vm connection

524
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
table and see what this ip has been

525
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
doing and

526
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
the thing about the data in

527
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
in log analytics is that there's so many

528
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
different data sources there's 57

529
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
tables just in this demo site it would

530
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
be impossible for me to know the name of

531
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
each and every column in each table so a

532
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
really useful command is limit which

533
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,039
just gives you a number of rows from the

534
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,360
table random rows so you can get an idea

535
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,919
of what data is stored within the table

536
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,000
and if we run this command it will

537
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
return us 10 random rows and we can sort

538
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
it see what information is stored within

539
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
the table so we have time generated we

540
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,880
have a computer we have the direction of

541
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,799
the connection the process name source

542
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,840
ip destination port protocol so basic

543
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,720
connection information and now we want

544
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
to look at the specific

545
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
ip address so we want to

546
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
define the condition where remote ip has

547
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
and then we want to add the string that

548
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
contains the ip address that we're

549
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
looking for

550
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
and the project bit is a clever way to

551
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
actually show the columns that will be

552
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
interesting for our investigation

553
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
so to sort the data in a way that as an

554
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
analyst i'll know what's going on in

555
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,640
here so if we run this command

556
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
it will give us the details of three

557
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
connections that have been made from

558
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
this remote ip address

559
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,919
the direction of the connection so the

560
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,080
connections were inbound so into our

561
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
network the computer to which the

562
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
connections have been made the

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
destination port protocol the byte sent

564
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
and bytes received so from this

565
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
information i know that the destination

566
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,679
port means it was http protocol so

567
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
there's probably a web server that's on

568
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,679
that computer and

569
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,200
from the naming convention of the

570
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
computer i assume that it might be to do

571
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,880
something with retail i'm not sure um so

572
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,120
let's dig a little bit deeper so let's

573
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
have a look at those tools that i

574
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
defined previously and try to get a

575
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,480
little bit more information about this

576
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,840
ip address

577
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
a cool tool is threadcrowd

578
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,919
where you can look up urls domains and

579
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
ip addresses

580
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,840
and um in threadcloud there's an option

581
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
to vote whether something is malicious

582
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,880
or not it's a free tool um open source

583
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,840
and

584
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
there's a just a button here where you

585
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,039
can specify whether you think it's

586
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,400
malicious or whether you don't think

587
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
it's malicious

588
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
from most of the votes received for this

589
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,799
particular ip it does have a malicious

590
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
status but there's no details telling us

591
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,760
here

592
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
why is it malicious or what was it

593
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,600
reported doing there's no uh web pages

594
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
no domains attached to this ip or at

595
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,880
least that

596
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
that appears from the information

597
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
provided here so let's move on to the

598
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
next tool and let's look at

599
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
the ip and talos so telus is a cisco

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,240
tool and again you can look up ip

601
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,559
addresses you can look up domains it's

602
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,280
really cool and it provides you

603
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
relatively reliable information so in

604
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,760
here we can see that the location of the

605
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
ip is uk

606
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
we can see the host name the domain name

607
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
and the network owner

608
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
we can see that there it has a very poor

609
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
email reputation and that there is a

610
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,039
unusual spike of the volume of traffic

611
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,799
that has been seen from this particular

612
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,159
ip

613
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,400
it also mentions that the ip has been

614
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
seen

615
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,320
listed on a block list

616
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
and it also shows us the ip range and

617
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
other hosts that are connected or seen

618
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
as part of this particular ip range

619
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
cool so now let's look at the

620
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,360
information in abuse ip database

621
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
so in here the geolocation of the ip is

622
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
actually netherlands

623
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
it shows us that it looks like a data

624
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
center web hosting

625
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
it shows us the isp so the company with

626
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
which the ip is registered and if we

627
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,039
look a little bit further down

628
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,720
it actually has information on the

629
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
reports where the ip was reported as

630
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
seen doing something malicious and in

631
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
the cathedral we can see what was it

632
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,919
seen doing so majority of the entries

633
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,840
here is port scanning

634
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
and you can see that this data shows

635
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,480
that the ip is actively being reported

636
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
as seen doing something malicious so if

637
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
you put this information together you

638
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
might assume that that ip is doing some

639
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
sort of scanning activity uh sending

640
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,600
requests to retail vm

641
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
over port 80. so the question that needs

642
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
to be asked is whether this computer

643
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
should be internet facing

644
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,159
and whether this port should be open and

645
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
that's something that you would raise

646
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,799
with the customer or with the company

647
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
cool that's the demo

648
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,520
let's go back to our presentation let me

649
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,280
just find my cursor

650
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,960
[Music]

651
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
there you go so we've investigated the

652
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
activity we used kql to retrieve data

653
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
and get information about what activity

654
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,559
the ip has been doing and then we used

655
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,240
um

656
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,600
the three tools to actually look at

657
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,360
what was it involved

658
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,200
with why was it reported in threat

659
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
intelligence why is it considered to be

660
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,760
malicious now the reason why you can't

661
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
just assume that if something was marked

662
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,400
as malicious it has to be malicious

663
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,360
as i mentioned before very often an idea

664
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
might be used by different things if

665
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,480
it's a web server it could host 10 or 20

666
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
different websites and if you just block

667
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,520
an ip it means that you're blocking all

668
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
of those websites everything that's

669
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
hosted on this particular ip

670
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
and a fun situation that i have been

671
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,679
involved in was whenever i received a

672
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,480
alert for an ip that was associated with

673
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
c2 activity

674
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
so uh c2 activity command and control is

675
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,520
whenever there is a piece of malware um

676
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
on your device that's trying to reach to

677
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,799
its mothership to so to the c2 domain to

678
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,679
um

679
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
get more malicious content downloaded

680
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,679
onto your device

681
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,440
and um i've logged into defender to look

682
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,600
at the detail of the activity in more

683
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
detail the fender is an absolutely

684
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,039
amazing tool but we won't cover it today

685
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,640
there's just not enough time

686
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
and at indefender i only saw this one

687
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
domain being browsed three times so i

688
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
saw a user logging in i saw a chrome

689
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
session being started and then i saw the

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,039
domain being browsed three times and

691
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,760
that was it so normally with c2 you

692
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,480
would expect there to be more random

693
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
domains being browsed the malware would

694
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,320
try to reach out all the time if it

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
wouldn't be able to connect it would try

696
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,159
something else i wasn't able to see

697
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,960
anything there so my question was what

698
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
was that domain doing like what is it

699
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
and it turned out to be a bagel shop in

700
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,640
new york

701
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
so i thought okay let's look at the ip

702
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,039
address and i looked at the ip address

703
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,400
in threadcrowd and it turned out that

704
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
there's a bunch of different um domains

705
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,360
a bunch of different websites that were

706
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,600
hosted on this particular ip address so

707
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,200
my next question was like okay so let's

708
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
look at the user that was performing

709
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
this activity and sure enough the user

710
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
was actually based in new york so it was

711
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
someone who was just trying to buy a

712
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
bagel browse to a website but because

713
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
the website resolved this ip that was

714
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
marked as malicious he wasn't able to

715
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,000
get to it because it was blocked and so

716
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,360
in the end you probably didn't get that

717
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
bagel um but yeah that's why you don't

718
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
want to mark eyepiece as malicious or

719
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
block the eyepiece there

720
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
there's more to it

721
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,760
so why would you want to work in a sock

722
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,159
it's an amazing learning experience

723
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,559
you're ex you're exposed to those all

724
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
different alerts that are relating to

725
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,640
various activities and it's all a

726
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
learning curve for you whenever you're

727
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
investigating an alert and you're not

728
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
sure what it's doing

729
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,320
you have to learn and you have to um

730
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
identify what's the activity why the

731
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,279
alert triggered um for me again this is

732
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,679
my personal experience uh working in the

733
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,440
software i'm also working with other

734
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
teams and there's incident response

735
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
there's engineering there's pen testing

736
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
so all of those teams we have to

737
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,919
cooperate together we're like one

738
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,730
organism that has to work as a team

739
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,840
[Music]

740
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,720
team working and customer facing so it

741
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,320
helps you to build up on those skills

742
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
not all

743
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,159
security analyst roles are customer

744
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,000
facing but if you work in a role like

745
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,399
that that's a very valuable

746
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,720
experience it's also networking so if

747
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
you cooperate with other teams you get

748
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
to chat with them you can ask them about

749
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,960
you know what does their role involve

750
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
how does their day look um ask them to

751
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
teach you some cool stuff um it's a good

752
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
career opportunity so

753
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,520
you build up your skills you build up

754
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
your knowledge and you can move on to

755
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,080
other teams

756
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,320
and it's also a prospect of good salary

757
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,120
so from the research that i did um very

758
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,880
skilled security analysts can earn

759
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,960
really good money um so yeah

760
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,600
now the important things that um i know

761
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,840
that majority of you are students or

762
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,159
very in very early stages of your career

763
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,080
so very important things that i'd like

764
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
all of you to remember is that the best

765
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
way to learn about the industry from my

766
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
own experience is to actually work in

767
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,399
cyber security and you're able to chat

768
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,320
with different people get an idea of

769
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,159
what the job involves

770
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
very often the idea that we have in our

771
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,000
heads or the idea that the job

772
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,559
descriptions give us are very far off

773
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
from what the job actually is

774
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,279
career perhaps can be changed i was once

775
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,880
an administrator i was an optical

776
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
assistant i work in different jobs and

777
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,919
if you haven't noticed i'm really old

778
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,480
probably majority of you are closer in

779
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
age to my daughter who's going to high

780
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,039
school next year than to me i'm that old

781
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,120
so you can change careers at any point i

782
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,480
changed my three years ago drastically

783
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,840
and

784
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,039
professional burnout is real so try to

785
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,440
find a job that will make you happy try

786
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,679
to find something that you're passionate

787
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,480
about

788
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
if if you'll be working in a job that

789
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,679
you know is stressful it's making you

790
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
very anxious you will burn out quickly

791
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,919
um

792
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
impostor syndrome it affects many

793
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
cybersecurity professionals no matter

794
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
how experienced they are

795
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,640
i still feel that i'm learning and

796
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
there's so much more that i need to

797
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
learn and i don't think i'll ever get to

798
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,919
the stage well i'll be like i've seen

799
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,080
everything and i know everything and

800
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,880
technology is developing there's no new

801
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
threats new vulnerabilities you will

802
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,399
never ever get to a point where you'll

803
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
be like i know everything

804
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
and if you're looking for your first job

805
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,559
make your cp stand out show how

806
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,159
passionate you are so if you're

807
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
participating in conferences like this

808
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
show it if you're taking part in any uh

809
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
capture the flags activities or doing

810
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
try hacking or anything like that show

811
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,320
it show how passionate you are

812
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,360
um networking circumferences amazing

813
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
you've got the sponsor stands there go

814
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,520
ask questions show yourself ask if you

815
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
can send a cv ask what are the job

816
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,720
opportunities there and don't be afraid

817
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,279
to reach out to companies directly um

818
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,600
i've actually got the job by approaching

819
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,200
car quorum at a similar conference back

820
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
at napier and i just went straight to

821
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,039
the managing director and asked if they

822
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,559
had jobs and that's how it all started

823
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,520
so

824
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
what's the time

825
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,799
okay

826
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,120
there's still time so do you have any

827
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,600
questions yet

828
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,159
sometimes with

829
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,600
automated responses not being

830
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,719
investigated as much

831
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,840
[Music]

832
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
well um whenever you're automating

833
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,720
things you really need to be careful at

834
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
as what you're automating and what your

835
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
white listing it's very easy to miss

836
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
malicious activity so

837
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
in quorum we usually have the process of

838
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
discussing it in a wider team and

839
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
people throwing all the bad stuff saying

840
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,080
well if you do it that way this is the

841
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,519
bad thing that could happen or this is

842
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,960
the bad thing that you can that can

843
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
happen so always leave it to open

844
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
discussion don't just assume that you

845
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,159
know everything and that your decision

846
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,840
will be the best put it out for the

847
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,840
wider discussion before

848
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,000
implementing well any other questions

849
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
yes

850
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,559
um

851
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,159
well you would in use kql whenever

852
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,080
you're setting up the alert rules

853
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,679
because the alert rules are written in

854
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,480
kql there's some pre-configured ones in

855
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,559
sentinel a template rules that you can

856
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,640
use but obviously there's so many

857
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
threats new vulnerabilities that are

858
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
coming out that you might want to write

859
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,679
some custom ones

860
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,240
and so as a security engineer you use

861
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
kql to write those queries to detect

862
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,919
activity as an analyst i would use it to

863
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,679
investigate the alerts i would receive

864
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,919
an alert for example for an ip and i

865
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
would have to go into the logs to see

866
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
what activity this ip has been involved

867
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,519
in

868
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
and there's another aspect of for

869
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,240
example incident response uses kql so

870
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,720
it's an easy way for them to get and try

871
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,360
to establish how did a malicious actor

872
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,600
get in or how the malware got onto a

873
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,600
device and then tried to establish the

874
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
vector of the attack so whether there

875
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
was any lateral movement or you know

876
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
whether other users were compromised um

877
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
and fret hunts you can use kql for

878
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
threat hunts um i've mentioned microsoft

879
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
defender it's an amazing platform and it

880
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,200
uses kql as well and the

881
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,679
amount of logs and the level of detail

882
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,799
in those logs is just mind-blowing um

883
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
but that's for a separate talk

884
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,880
any other questions yes

885
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,660
um

886
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,829
[Music]

887
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,949
[Music]

888
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
or you

889
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
also have

890
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,480
experience with other uh same solutions

891
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,720
so and wouldn't know um what your

892
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
opinion is

893
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
with respect to same solutions and how

894
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,799
they help limit

895
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,560
so with regards to other tools um i'm

896
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,599
three years in cyber security and i've

897
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,599
two years in working as a security

898
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,199
analyst and quorum is the only company

899
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,280
i've worked so far and we're a microsoft

900
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
based company so obviously i wasn't

901
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
exposed to other tools i can give you a

902
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
comparison of which tool is better or

903
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,760
which deal is worse there's divided

904
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,280
opinions and the thing that you'll

905
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,599
notice whenever you're looking at a

906
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,839
security analyst position is that every

907
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,239
company will use a different tool and

908
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,719
there's like splunk for example there

909
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,760
are

910
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,359
different platforms that are used as

911
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,040
well um

912
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,199
i think that if you have a proper

913
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
mindset the

914
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
learning curve of using a new tool isn't

915
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,560
that difficult but it's the mindset of

916
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,720
investigating things of identifying

917
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,680
whether it's malicious or if it's benign

918
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,839
understanding of how networking works of

919
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,480
how traffic moves and asking proper

920
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240
questions those are the skills that you

921
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
need as an analyst the tools are just an

922
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,280
extra part that you use to

923
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
move your investigation forward but it's

924
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,119
the mindset that you need in order to

925
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
investigate it properly and get the

926
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
proper

927
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,520
proper resolution proper

928
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
proper conclusion for what you're

929
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
looking for with regards to false

930
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,400
positive and false negative and they are

931
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,599
extremely uh difficult especially false

932
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,280
positives whenever you think you're

933
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,000
looking at a malicious behavior you have

934
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
to be really certain before closing off

935
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,520
an alert as benign that what you're just

936
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,000
identifying as benign is actually that

937
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
so very often in my

938
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
in my job role whenever i'm not sure i

939
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
would reach out to other people i

940
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,400
wouldn't limit it to just my opinion of

941
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,720
i think it's benign i would get a wider

942
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
audience to look at something and

943
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,680
come to the same conclusion or challenge

944
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,599
uh challenge me to say no actually you

945
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,160
need to also consider this this or this

946
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
does that answer

947
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,839
that answer your question or

948
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240
any other questions

949
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,240
yeah

950
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,099
[Music]

951
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
no it works much better you've got

952
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,440
everything sorted within tables and

953
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,520
there are out-of-box solutions to for

954
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,640
example uh ingest firewall logs or to

955
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,640
ingest aws logs um another question is

956
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,520
of understanding what those logs mean so

957
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,680
obviously aws environment is for example

958
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,599
completely different to

959
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
microsoft environment and as an analyst

960
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,760
it's sometimes challenging for me to

961
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
understand those two different

962
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,880
environments

963
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,400
same for the on-prem

964
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
activity the on-prem logs are all

965
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,760
ingested into security event table

966
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
within sentinel and that contains all

967
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,160
the activity so it contains user

968
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,079
behavior it contains application

969
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,960
behavior and seeing through that noise

970
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
can be very challenging for me as an

971
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,160
analyst

972
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,839
but again it's a matter of a learning

973
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,720
curve

974
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
if there's an unknown that you're

975
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,200
looking at you will ask other people you

976
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,440
will reach out to other people and try

977
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,680
to learn as much as you can to then be

978
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,119
better the next time you look at the

979
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,520
same issue

980
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,920
oh any other questions

981
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,880
yeah

982
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,880
um

983
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,760
so i guess that would depend on the

984
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,119
company as i've mentioned there's

985
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,520
different job titles to security

986
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,440
analysts so there's like cloud security

987
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,839
information security some companies have

988
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,079
different tiers of a security analyst

989
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,839
some companies have junior and senior

990
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
position um within quorum there would be

991
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
a

992
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,640
junior position a senior position and

993
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,960
then a manager position but there's also

994
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,599
option to move laterally so to other

995
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,920
teams for example if incident response

996
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,680
is something that you're interested in

997
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,599
you would obviously from security

998
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,960
analysts tried to move to incident

999
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
response where you would mainly try to

1000
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,200
investigate the malicious behavior and

1001
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
try to investigate the vector of the

1002
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,079
attack

1003
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,680
if engineering is something that you're

1004
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,280
interested in there would be an option

1005
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,240
to move from a security analyst engineer

1006
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,200
or to pen testing and so you can go up

1007
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,320
but you can also go sideways so if

1008
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
working in the stock isn't fulfilling

1009
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,720
your expectations there's always option

1010
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,040
to branch out to other departments other

1011
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,839
teams

1012
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,599
any other questions yes

1013
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,280
thank you very much

1014
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,409
[Music]

1015
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,440
historically also trivial to say if you

1016
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,640
see this again

1017
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,520
i'll capture that data

1018
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,599
yeah um so

1019
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
i think by default uh the data is stored

1020
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
for three months but obviously there are

1021
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
options for companies to store the data

1022
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,960
for longer and the issue is that the

1023
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,839
more data you store in log analytics the

1024
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,560
more money it costs same for enabling

1025
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,079
connectors so

1026
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,320
you can ingest your firewall logs but

1027
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
obviously firewall logs can be extremely

1028
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,280
noisy

1029
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
so very often it's a matter of filtering

1030
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,760
those locks before they get ingested

1031
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
into sentinel in order to save money um

1032
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
and a thing that i've i've noticed

1033
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,760
personally is that very often uh

1034
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,520
companies don't realize how precious the

1035
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,400
logs are until something bad happens and

1036
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,800
you tell them where actually there's not

1037
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
enough data to investigate because you

1038
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,640
haven't had this and this and this

1039
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,680
enabled um so yeah so so very often

1040
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
something that has to happen in order to

1041
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
that metric to be ingested and be

1042
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,040
available for analysis

1043
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,839
any other questions

1044
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,800
okay thank you very much i hope that you

1045
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,040
enjoyed if you have any questions that

1046
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,200
