1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,440
alrighty hi everyone thanks for coming

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
and i'm joe i'm going to be talking to

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,960
you about finding novel forensic

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
artifacts

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,320
don't let the background worry you this

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,520
will not be as bad as sitting through

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
the new matrix film my talk will be

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,640
shorter

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,520
so let's get to it

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,680
so a brief overview of what we're going

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
to look at

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
we'll start off by looking at some

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
threat actors

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,679
and

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,440
this will demonstrate what we're up

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,399
against

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
i will have a couple case studies uh

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
detailing public information from

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
infosec companies

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
and that will get us all onto the same

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
page

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,079
and

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,760
then we'll

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
then we'll dig into a case study of a

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,600
novel artifact i found while i was doing

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
some research uh one weekend last summer

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
finally i'll round off with some tips on

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,239
finding your own novel artifacts

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
and we should have some time for some q

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,719
a maybe

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
so who am i um i'm a student studying

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
cyber security and forensics

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
uh i've

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
before university i was a stock

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
reliability engineer

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,000
and

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
i've been doing forensics research since

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,439
the summer of 2019 and since then i've

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
worked at a financial institution and a

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
cyber security startup

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
and but we won't be talking about that

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
today and much nda such side

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,880
so

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
i'm currently working and researching in

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
the field of incident response

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
i'm a first-time speaker but a long time

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
attendee of security conferences

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
so our first case study is a pretty

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,000
well-known e-crime actor

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,560
known as wizard spider

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
they're known for a trickbot ryuk

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
ponti

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,399
primarily

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,520
and their main goal is to exfil your

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,399
data

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
and deploy ransomware

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,239
they're pretty opportunistic but they do

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,360
do

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
big game hunting

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,959
so they'll only target your organization

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,160
if you've got a couple million in the

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
bank

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,080
their time scale is really short they'll

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
deploy their ransomware within a matter

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
of days or weeks

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
and they're pretty overt as well so

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
they'll leave a lot of evidence behind

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,280
logs

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
just malware lying around on your system

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
and you know like a ransom note saying

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
who did it and that they want so many

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
bitcoins paid their address

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
i told us here it was pretty safe to

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
target western companies

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
from russia but given what's happening

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
with the real gang

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,519
that does seem to be changing so

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,040
i'll be watching their career with great

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
interest and these guys particularly

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,560
have been subject to another

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
leak since i made these slides

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
i always appreciate it when uh

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,080
thread actor welcomes themselves onto a

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
system that they've popped

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
the screenshot is from

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,680
the

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
slapstick backdoor which we'll talk

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,239
about a wee bit later

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
our second case study

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
is known as light basin or unc 1945

91
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,720
depending on who you asked

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
they are highly targeted

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,599
they'll target specific industries as

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,680
well as specific victims within those

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
industries

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
and they will conduct espionage over a

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
period of many years they're also really

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
covert so

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,480
they'll hide their traps they'll go to

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
great lengths to hide their tracks

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
even to the point of creating their own

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,879
custom anti-forensics tooling

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,439
like log bleach which again will get to

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,959
a little bit later

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
um

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
they've also gone as far as to replace

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
the iptables binary with a trojanized

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
version that will wrap legitimate ip

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
tables commands and obfuscate the rules

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
that they've added to facilitate the

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
back door that they've put onto your

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
system

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,400
they also demonstrate some familiarity

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,199
with

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
telco infrastructure like edns which is

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
used for roaming on your mobile

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
and

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
they have the ability to capture

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
subscriber information and call metadata

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,639
so they are really sophisticated

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
so a couple takeaways so far

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
uh was it spider are bad people

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
like racing the bad people

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
but light basin also used some really

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
sophisticated anti-forensics techniques

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
uh these guys are essentially the

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,320
complete opposite end of the spectrum

128
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
with a

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
very over ransomware gang and a very

130
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
covert most likely state-sponsored actor

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
so in terms of what we're talking about

132
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,039
today the highly sophisticated actor is

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
is by far the more interesting

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,080
so

135
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,759
i'm going to take a look at the tools

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
techniques and procedures

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
that are used by white basin

138
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
starting off with evil sun which is a

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,440
zero day exploit and solaris pam

140
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
and this is about as bad as it gets and

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
it's got a cvss score of 10

142
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
it's a remote code execution

143
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
and

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
we've got the slapstick back door so

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
once they've gained access they're going

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
to insert their pan back door onto your

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
solaris machines

148
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,039
and

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,280
the back door is used to maintain

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
persistence so even if the initial

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
vulnerability is patched which uh the

152
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
zero day does now have a patch

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
uh they can still maintain access

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
because they've they've backboarded the

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
system as well

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,600
you've heard of lol bins

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
but just in case

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,639
um

159
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
what they are is

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
living off the land binaries and scripts

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
this is essentially

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,039
components of the operating system

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
which can be abused by attackers to do

164
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
bad things this is anything from

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
downloading stuff to sign binary proxy

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
execution

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,039
and

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
these uh present a real challenge to

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,240
defenders

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
because they're present on the operating

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,759
system and they have a lot of legitimate

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
uses

173
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,479
so like basin's been known to go even

174
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
further they'll bring along their own uh

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
virtual machine

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
which is complete with a

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
arsenal of post exploitation tools like

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,198
mini cats power sploit

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
c2 and more so mandiant described it as

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
you've heard of living off the land or

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
how about bringing your own island

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
uh ping pong

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
is an icmp

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
uh signaling implant that crowdstrike

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
discovered

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
and

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
uh

188
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
it's uh been

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
they've actually got persistence with

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
this thing by adding a line to the

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,720
system 5 init script for ssh

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
so it's quite a subtle way of making

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,840
sure that this thing is going to run

194
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,800
okay so we've talked about log bleach

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,360
uh so lovely wipes evidence out of some

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
of the most valuable logs

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,800
things like syslog and authlog

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,560
and it can also

199
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
well it's got a whole bunch of logs that

200
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,160
it's actually going to white by default

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
but you can also add additional logs to

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,520
that as well

203
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
so this really complicates

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
the incident response because all of the

205
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
best sources of information are actually

206
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,039
just wiped out

207
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
finally steel corgi is a packer that's

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
executed in memory

209
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
packers are basically used in malware to

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
make reverse engineering more

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
challenging

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
so hunting this adversary is a really

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
complex task it requires a skilled team

214
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
familiar with

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
os internals

216
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
telco networks and able to understand

217
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,720
the few novel artifacts that this

218
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,440
actor doesn't like

219
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
so despite light basins finesse mandiant

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
and crowdstrike have disrupted numerous

221
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
intrusions and shine a light on the

222
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
activities of the sector

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,320
but at this time they remain an

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
unidentified cluster and cluster is

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
definitely the right word

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,600
so exhibit makes a good point here as

227
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,480
well

228
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
there is a difference between novel

229
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,480
sources and novel malware or tooling

230
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,279
uh basically sources should point you to

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,240
the malware or what the malware did

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
or what the threat actor did

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,519
when they had hands on keyboard

234
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,959
so to fully understand the malware

235
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
you're still going to need to reverse

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
engineer it most likely

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
for this talk we'll be focusing on the

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,000
sources

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
and

240
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
we might want to do this for a few

241
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,519
reasons

242
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
but usually it's going to be

243
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
a case of building a more complete

244
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
picture than what's available with the

245
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
usual stuff

246
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
also if you're a consultant

247
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
there's no guarantee that you've got

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
optimal logging or monitoring configured

249
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,920
uh you might just need to work with

250
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,720
whatever you've got

251
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
and

252
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
we've also got advanced actors like

253
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
light basin who are actually going to

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
wipe out all the well-known sources of

255
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
information

256
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
and

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
the novel artifacts might be all you've

258
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
got

259
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
so we're going to go into the case study

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
for a novel artifact that i found

261
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
and this is a really easy to understand

262
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
small example

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,720
and it's based on my blog post

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
and i went down so well when i read it

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
that i had to turn it into a dog

266
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
the artifact is found in your

267
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
home directory on linux and a file

268
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,079
called

269
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
wget hsds

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
and but this is configurable with a

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
command line flag which is dash dash

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,760
hdss

273
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
hsds file and then whatever file you

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,439
want to put in

275
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
and i'm sure anybody who's ever

276
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
had to administer a rail server can

277
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,560
relate to our editor

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
so what is

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
www.hsts

280
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
well wget is a command line downloader

281
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
and it's really really popular on unix

282
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,959
and linux platforms

283
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
it's often installed by default

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
and

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
so admins love it because

286
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
you can download

287
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
and stuff from github or

288
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
anywhere on the internet and

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
run that in a script

290
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
so this can be really useful if you want

291
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,279
to

292
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,680
um

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
[Music]

294
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,560
yeah if you want to get a bunch of

295
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
program or a program onto a bunch of

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
servers and you just want to do that

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,279
with a script

298
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,360
an admin might do that legitimately but

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
thread actors love it as well

300
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
this is a small example of the kind of

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
thing that you might find in a crontab

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,519
file

303
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,480
so this will download a file that is

304
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
totally not a web shell and pipe it into

305
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,399
your shell

306
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,079
and it will do that every 20 minutes

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
so

308
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
and this is just a very basic

309
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
persistence mechanism

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
and

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,800
uh

312
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
they could have added the no hts hsts

313
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
flag and it wouldn't have even shown up

314
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
in the hsts cache but anybody who would

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
leave this in your crown tab is probably

316
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,000
not too worried about getting caught

317
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
also if they were being really modern

318
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,279
they might use a systemd timer instead

319
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,680
of crop

320
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
so

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,160
hsts is

322
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
um

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,959
hsts is rfc

324
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,639
6797 it's about 10 years old from

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
november 2012

326
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
and it's become really popular with the

327
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
encrypted web movement because we want

328
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
to really mitigate adversaries in the

329
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
middle

330
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
so this works as a big stepping stone

331
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,320
towards https everywhere

332
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
as long as http is supported

333
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
unless you give the protocol to the

334
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,839
browser

335
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
the unencrypted http

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
version of the site is the thing that

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
has to get requested first

338
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
because otherwise you just get a

339
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
certificate error essentially you just

340
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
break all unencrypted sites if browsers

341
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
didn't do that

342
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
so

343
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
hsts

344
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
is a way that websites can assert to

345
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
always be available over an encrypted

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,760
channel

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
so the browser will

348
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
actually cache a header

349
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,519
that

350
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
that it then knows the next time it

351
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,639
requests the website even if you don't

352
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
give it the protocol it knows to request

353
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
it over https instead of http

354
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
browsers have even gone further than

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
this and they'll allow you to pre-load

356
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,800
hsts

357
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
and that means that the browser actually

358
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
hard codes the site

359
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,440
as https in the browser

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
and it entirely disallows downgrades

361
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
entirely disallows any way to access the

362
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
site over http

363
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
so wn obviously doesn't support

364
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
preloading

365
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
but pre-loading is important

366
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,399
uh because otherwise that first visit to

367
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,600
the website

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
could be unencrypted

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
so if it was and you had an adversary in

370
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
the middle that first time they could

371
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,880
strip out all of the hsts they could

372
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,160
strip out the upgrade to http

373
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
because what normally happens is you

374
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
would request the site over http the

375
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
server will redirect you to https and

376
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,120
also give you the header to say

377
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
hsts compliant

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,600
hsts is getting super popular as well

379
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
one of my laptops has over a thousand

380
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
entries in the cache

381
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,839
from just the few websites that i browse

382
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
regularly and that doesn't include

383
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,440
anything that happens over

384
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
the private browsing mode because that

385
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
stuff doesn't get cached properly

386
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,199
or doesn't get cached at all

387
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
so the adversary in the middle can

388
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
passively eavesdrop on an unencrypted

389
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
connection

390
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
uh but they can also actively inject an

391
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,720
attack so there isn't really any such

392
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
thing as a site that doesn't need

393
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
encryption encryption forces the

394
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
adversary to compromise a website

395
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
which might not raise the bar by all

396
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,639
that much but it also makes attacks

397
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
necessarily more targeted

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
so what does file look like

399
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,480
so

400
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,600
we've got a hostname which is the hsts

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,240
enabled hostname that wget is connected

402
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,360
to

403
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
we've got a port which is a non-default

404
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
port

405
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
and but the manual page actually says

406
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
it's just for testing purposes so it's

407
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
not really used at all

408
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
whether the

409
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,079
hsds policy supports sub-domains which

410
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,320
is stored as a boolean

411
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
creation timestamp and epoch time which

412
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
shows the time that the website or host

413
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
was last connected to

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
by wget

415
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
and the max age which is the duration

416
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,079
the hsts policy is valid for

417
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,920
the line starting with a hash or

418
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
comments and they're just completely

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
ignored but we basically just got a

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,120
version information

421
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,680
uh a little warning not to edit the file

422
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
and

423
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,680
uh some table headers so that we got a

424
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,959
rough idea of what these different

425
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,839
things are

426
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
so 31 million seconds is a year

427
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
and that's the minimum that's required

428
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,480
for preloading

429
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,959
and they recommend these days to use uh

430
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,959
two years instead it was a little bit

431
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
more liberal when i did it

432
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
and the entries don't seem to get uh

433
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,199
purged from this cache so i've got uh

434
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,160
entries in my cache in 2018 that expired

435
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
after a year but there doesn't seem to

436
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
be any process that actually goes in

437
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,639
there and cleans them up

438
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
so what can we do with this information

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
well we can remove all of the hsts stuff

440
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
uh get rid of the comments convert the

441
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
epub timestamp to utc

442
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
uh we can order that as timestamp and

443
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
host and sort it for chronological order

444
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,679
you can do all that with a liner that

445
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
looks something like this

446
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,319
and this can be a really useful way to

447
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
just triage one or a small number of

448
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
systems

449
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
and but what you can also do is

450
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
integrate this into some larger tooling

451
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
and then import it all into splunk which

452
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,559
might be a little bit more useful

453
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,240
so there's a few gotchas um mostly this

454
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,799
is not a wget history file

455
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
so this is only going to include hsds

456
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
enabled hosts but as we said that is

457
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
quite a significant portion of the

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
internet

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,679
it's also not going to give you the url

460
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,039
path information

461
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,160
so you might know that a host was used

462
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
to download something from github but

463
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,760
that doesn't mean

464
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
that you know what was downloaded from

465
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
github however if it's suspicious that

466
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
the host downloaded something from

467
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,760
github in general then

468
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,880
that

469
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
that might be enough of an indication

470
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,240
to know that something's up

471
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
thanks for watching

472
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,600
so we're out of time you have to move on

473
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,000
to the next talk

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
you
