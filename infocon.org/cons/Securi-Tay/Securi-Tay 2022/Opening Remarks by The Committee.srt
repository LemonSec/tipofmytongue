let's see yeah

60
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
no drinking any diversity uh we had

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,119
complaints last year about people

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
university please not alcohol we do have

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
refreshments and beverages for you

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
they're all way up the top at the foyer

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
just over there and ask anybody in the

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
yellow t-shirt they'll be able to take

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,239
you there

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,840
and again if you need anything people

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
wearing yellow or any of us wearing pink

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
will be able to help you okay okay

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
cool so there's no fire drill plan today

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
so if you do hear the fire alarm

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
it's probably a joke probably should

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
leave the building uh volunteers will be

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,959
about if you do get lost and they'll be

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
able to help you direct you out um

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
uh so

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
basically just find fire exits you

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
should be fine

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,760
yeah basically here's fire alarm run

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,319
don't touch anything so the last time

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
was two years ago just before um coleman

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,120
probably had covered was still called

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,360
the wuhan virus back then and uh when we

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,879
were watching the old pain remarks from

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
that year's committee they had a nice

88
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,480
wee statement about everything but we're

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,959
now dealing with it please do sanitize

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
please keep your masks on um be a bit

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,120
be just aware of it um

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
as well as that you'll see is the please

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
don't sit here signs they are not um set

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,440
in stone so basically just have one seat

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
between yourself and the next party over

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
move that sign around if you've got a

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
party of six people we don't mind

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
everyone else sitting in the same row

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,080
but just have space between yourself and

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
the next part to try and limit the

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
spread and make it as much

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,920
as normal as possible

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
and i think i'm gonna

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
yeah there you go

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
so we've got some people in the small

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
lecture hall as well um which will be

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,879
using that as well for the

108
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
closing keynotes

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
and just doing a bit of streaming which

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
is where tech issues come from

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
um as well

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,480
i

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
hate the universe capacity so if you

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
want 10 minutes of your life wasted come

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
gap between you in the next party said

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,400
that

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,719

masks put them on keep them on um you

125
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,080

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
unless you're outside different

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
restrictions for the after party will

tell you closer towards the time how

129
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
that works okay

130
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
and if you don't i'll go through this

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
very complex set of instructions here

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
