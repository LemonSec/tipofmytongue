1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,279
yeah so

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,560
cheers everyone for coming into this

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,719
talk um

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,200
so like i've talked about saving user

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,960
data one company at a time and it's one

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,399
company at a time because it's

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
based on the companies that give me

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
permission to hack them basically um but

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
every company that does allow me to hack

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,119
them via bug binding programs

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,320
i'm finding your user data a lot of

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,400
times basically

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
um so for those of you who know me

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,279
online follow me

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,800
um my name's e shawner not only hack

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
with birth sweets that's why i've put

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
that on there as well

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
um i don't really focus on the recon and

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,360
things like that i tend to come to that

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
later which is yeah i'm basically going

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
to teach you kind of how i hack and why

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
i hack this way

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
so very briefly really quickly i guess

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
um who am i so my name's sean

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
um and i go by the names of shawno

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
online and for those of you who follow

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,879
me on that

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,559
um i'm a web application security

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,640
researcher hacker

30
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,879
so that basically means companies with

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
big websites and pay me to find

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,480
vulnerabilities in them usually via bug

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,399
money programs

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,759
i've done a bit of mentoring over the

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
last year

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
i've got a few youtube videos out

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
teaching people how to hack and how to

38
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
approach hacking and getting involved in

39
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
hacking and i used to run a website

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
called bugbankingnotes.com and i'm

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,679
actually wearing one of the

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,360
30 hoodies that i had printed for it um

43
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
and for those for those of you who i am

44
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
talking who do follow me the reason why

45
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,158
i shut down bug by notes

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
is because it was kind of time

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
constraint for me because i do bug

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,040
mountains full time for a living i don't

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
have a job i don't have any grades

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
qualification certificates nothing

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
um so i rely on bug bounties to earn me

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,240
money um and

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,158
kind of bug banknotes was taking up too

54
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
much of my time and it wasn't earning me

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
anything

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
so but with that said the good news is

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
i have taken a step back and worked on

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
something that won't be as time

59
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
consuming for me and will

60
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
still be able to teach you all how to

61
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
hack like me um

62
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,839
so that will be out soon along with my

63
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
methodology

64
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
um and i've added on there that i'm a

65
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
lucio one trick because

66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,039
i play overwatch a lot and i play

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
nothing but lucio i've got like 600

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
hours logged and i like to use the memes

69
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
of his face and all of my slides so if

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
you're wondering who he is that's who he

71
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
is okay

72
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
um so yeah and yeah just a random

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,879
screenshot of me

74
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
on bob crowd um because i feel like one

75
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
of my great achievements is when i first

76
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,959
got involved in bug binding programs

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
is i picked one program bug crowd and

78
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,920
focus nothing

79
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
but on their program and i ended up with

80
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,440
like 450 vulnerabilities i

81
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
went from no bugs all the way to number

82
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,519
two um and yeah now pulling down to

83
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
number 11. but yeah

84
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,640
um so yeah that's me i've been done with

85
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,079
so

86
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,920
now we'll get into the fun stuff the

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
hacking so this is my approach to

88
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
hacking so everyone and this is what i

89
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
really emphasize in my methodology

90
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
everyone has got their own

91
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
approach to hacking a lot of people go

92
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
for recon they want to find sub domains

93
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,799
that come in live for a certain period

94
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,839
of time

95
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
but my approach is i just want to focus

96
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
on the main web applications so that

97
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
means apps that you've all got on your

98
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,518
phone

99
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
websites that you're using at home every

100
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
day these are main web application

101
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,599
websites and

102
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
thousands of people are using um

103
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
i come to the sub domains and what's

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
exposed on the internet later because

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
in my mindset and i used to be a bit of

106
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,720
a developer um before i was hacking but

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
a main web application if you can find

108
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
basic bugs that should be preventable

109
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
and shouldn't actually be there

110
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
then when you go to find the subdomains

111
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
and everything else else is exposed

112
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
you've already got a kind of general

113
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
mindset as to

114
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
what the security is going to be like

115
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
this company and what easy things are

116
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
probably going to be exposed out there

117
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,599
and what can you find

118
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,280
um so by

119
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
targeting a main web application like

120
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
i'm ignoring subdomains for now i'm

121
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
simply

122
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
using the website as intended so the

123
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
same way all of you will log into let's

124
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,159
say ebay

125
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,760
and you'll bid for something you'll buy

126
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,079
something you might want to then return

127
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
it

128
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
i simply just use a website as intended

129
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,599
and just

130
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
look at to how what how's it working

131
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,040
what request is sent

132
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
what ids what is actually how's it

133
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
working

134
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
um the bigger the company the better

135
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
and the reason for this is because

136
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
obviously for me

137
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,079
for bug bounties i rely on it for money

138
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
so i want as many mistakes as possible

139
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
but the bigger the company the more

140
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,599
teams teams they might have abroad for

141
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,839
different code bases and things

142
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,079
and that's going to mean more mistakes

143
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
so say for example you've got

144
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
i'll use tripadvisor for example the

145
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,520
website that i was hacking on bug crowd

146
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,280
they have their headquarters in america

147
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,479
so they have tripadvisor.com

148
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,159
but tripadvisor.cn is a completely

149
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
different code base with completely

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
different features

151
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
and it's just completely new so from

152
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
something as simple as changing your

153
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,719
user agent and what country you're from

154
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
you can go on mobile sites

155
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
change view different locations and

156
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
things like that and it just brings more

157
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
features

158
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
more bugs everyone following this is

159
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
pretty straightforward in my opinion my

160
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
methodology i guess oops i'm going

161
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,000
backwards

162
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,719
and also for that again is one mistake

163
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
in production

164
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
will always lead to many many more so

165
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
you find one xss chances are you're

166
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,198
going to find probably another 10.

167
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
you find one eye door probably going to

168
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
find a lot more and i mean you'll get a

169
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,160
general tone for how this company

170
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,759
security actually is

171
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
and this is why i always emphasize to

172
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,880
people that if you want to be successful

173
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
in bug money programs you should stick

174
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
to the same program

175
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
rather than hopping from program to

176
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
program to program because when

177
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,479
companies

178
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,359
fix the bugs look at how they've

179
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,280
actually fixed it

180
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
so i've had some companies where there

181
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
was an idol bug where i could leak

182
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,479
anyone's data

183
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,000
from just visiting api.example and

184
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
change the number

185
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,919
and they fixed it to view that user's id

186
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
you had to have a unique hash

187
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
which only the user was obtained when

188
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
they logged in

189
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,198
pretty straightforward i thought i cast

190
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
a nice fix however if you change it from

191
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
a get request to a post request

192
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,400
it would say oh there's an error and it

193
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
would spit out that user's

194
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
hash uni cache code so then i'd simply

195
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
grab the hash code change it back to a

196
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,000
get request add token and i've got their

197
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,239
user details again

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,199
so from seeing that then when they patch

199
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
the next bugs i

200
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
instantly know how are these developers

201
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
thinking

202
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,440
and another way and i don't kind of

203
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,039
recommend you do it as such but the more

204
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,719
you target the same programs

205
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,360
if you've got one endpoint with let's

206
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
say three xss vulnerabilities on it

207
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
if you sometimes only just report two

208
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
and leave one

209
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,240
you can get the sense of the company or

210
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
did they proactively go and look further

211
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
into the source code and see if there's

212
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,719
anything else vulnerable or did they

213
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
simply just patch what you told them

214
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
99 of the time they'll only patch what

215
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,560
you tell them so again

216
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,440
you can take advantage of that i guess

217
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
um

218
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
and i've written there javascript files

219
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
are your friends um

220
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
because if you see my i've got a couple

221
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,840
hour video on youtube for

222
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,280
basically analyzing javascript files and

223
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,359
that and a lot of people always tweet me

224
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,318
saying this is a genius like your genius

225
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,440
sean

226
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
but targeting a main web application

227
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
of course i'm going to look at

228
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
javascript files because that's how the

229
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
website has been put together you know

230
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,400
what i mean they use css files they use

231
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,599
javascript files this is how it's

232
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
actually put together

233
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,719
so sometimes when you're viewing the

234
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,440
source of a html file

235
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
there won't be much interest in their

236
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
power from some parameter names and

237
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,840
things like that but when you start

238
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
looking in the javascript files you can

239
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
see

240
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
old code which has been commented out

241
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,520
which goes to old api codes you've

242
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
sometimes got dev comments saying

243
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,799
this is just a hacky fix we'll work on

244
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,479
something later and things like that

245
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
sometimes even leave their passwords in

246
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
there

247
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,960
why i don't know so that is

248
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
basically my approach to hacking dumbed

249
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,359
down as much as i possibly can does

250
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
everyone

251
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
pretty much understand the flow really

252
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,479
so now i'm going to give you some

253
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
examples as to

254
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,758
basically apply my methodology and

255
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
hopefully not scare

256
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,120
some of you because some of your

257
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,400
students and one of my examples might

258
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,919
scare you so first of all

259
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,919
this is leaking passenger flight

260
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
information i did do a blog post on this

261
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,198
now

262
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,440
for those of you who have been on

263
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
holiday you understand when you check in

264
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,719
they want your book and reference and

265
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,198
the last name that you use to make the

266
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,680
booking right and it's pretty simple

267
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
now first of all booking references can

268
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,080
be easily guessed they're usually only

269
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,159
six characters

270
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
long they're only letters and

271
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,960
sometimes there's numbers in it but not

272
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,520
often depending on what airline etcetera

273
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
now again so applying my methodology to

274
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
use this

275
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
it's a website where i can book a flight

276
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
and check in etc so to obviously use it

277
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,879
as intended

278
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
i need to book a flight and check in

279
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
basically and

280
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,199
see how this is working because

281
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,758
not only when i check in but i get extra

282
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,520
to i get access to extra features so i

283
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,319
can select to see i can add an in-flight

284
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
meal

285
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,280
the more features i can get access to

286
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
the better because then i can get a

287
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,120
general idea as to how this company

288
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
basically is handling security because

289
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
one thing i always mention is i always

290
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
go and with the mindset that they're

291
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
secure

292
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
because this is a main web application

293
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
that thousands of people using so it

294
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
shouldn't be vulnerable so i'm going

295
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,200
into the mindset this is actually

296
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,440
secure basically um another reason

297
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
why obviously you should in my opinion

298
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,399
buy things on bug badly programs

299
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
especially is because not many people

300
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
will spend money on bug money programs

301
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
they'll only ever go after the free

302
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
features whereas if you buy a certain

303
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
feature to upgrade your account and

304
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
things

305
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,480
you can then suddenly start testing well

306
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240
can the free account actually access

307
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
the api calls that the paid account can

308
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,160
access and things like that

309
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
and characters are yes and like i said

310
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,600
two extremely key features

311
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,920
should be secure now

312
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
i don't recommend you try this on

313
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,839
airlines which haven't given you

314
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
permission to

315
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
but a lot more airlines are vulnerable

316
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
to this

317
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,439
and yeah i'll leave you to go with that

318
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
so what could possibly go wrong anyone

319
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
have any ideas what could actually

320
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
possibly go wrong

321
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
i mean anyone think that airlines are

322
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
pretty secure right they should be

323
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
secure shouldn't they they've got your

324
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,120
passport details

325
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,880
things like that so this isn't the

326
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
actual website's hacking i can't mention

327
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
names and things like that and

328
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
so yeah but pretty simple you've got to

329
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,519
enter your ticket number and your last

330
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,680
name everyone's done it

331
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,160
so yeah by default that's required

332
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
however when i used my valid reference

333
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,319
so i input my

334
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,760
ticket number and i put my last name

335
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
there was a request sent obviously to

336
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
load up my

337
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
booking information however in the

338
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
background

339
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,279
there was a request sent with just my

340
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
booking reference which responded with a

341
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,560
json format

342
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,239
of just my flight information so i had

343
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,518
like my name and things like that the

344
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,640
email used to book

345
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,920
and i was a bit like why like

346
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,360
why is this request being made like

347
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
this probably shouldn't be happening i

348
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,320
thought maybe this is intended because

349
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
i hadn't actually made an account at

350
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
this time i'd simply booked the flight

351
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,970
and then went to check in

352
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,770
because why not um

353
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,720
[Music]

354
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:38,480
[Laughter]

355
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
so the next task so before i did this

356
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
um and i did have a slide with uh the

357
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,439
requested information but i didn't want

358
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,519
to accidentally leak some information

359
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,600
and people find out what company it was

360
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
but when i found this request i then

361
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
search for the airline company and

362
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
search for any promotions they post

363
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
because a lot of airline companies will

364
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,359
post promotions

365
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,120
and they'll add an example booking

366
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
reference number on there so i was like

367
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
i wonder what this testing booking

368
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
reference does and whether

369
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
i can actually query it so when i

370
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,160
queried it it came back with all

371
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
tests at whatever it was and i was like

372
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,959
well hold up a second here this is

373
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
probably not good

374
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,239
so yeah basically there was one

375
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
vulnerability to leak anyone's

376
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
information

377
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,040
just on a booking reference right in

378
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,279
front of people live production website

379
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,959
i couldn't believe it in my opinion so

380
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
my next task

381
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
with attacking main web applications is

382
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,240
i want to find as

383
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,000
many features and end points as possible

384
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,640
which handle a booking reference

385
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
even if the last name is in the request

386
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
they might not actually validate it

387
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
might lead to another bug

388
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,599
because not only that is because i've

389
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
obviously found a fairly serious problem

390
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
chances are i'm going to make it rain

391
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
bounties and i'm going to be a very

392
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
happy man

393
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
so i don't really know why i put how i

394
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
guess because it's pretty

395
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,000
self-explanatory but so just

396
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
this is where i feel like first of all

397
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
how many people here do bug bounties or

398
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,720
dabbled in bug mounties

399
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,240
a few of you so a lot of people i find

400
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,800
will read a blog post and then go and

401
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
try that which is fair enough

402
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,199
but in my opinion again to be successful

403
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
in bug bounties is you kind of have to

404
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,120
create your own little path

405
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
while collecting what everyone else has

406
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,000
been sharing um because it's about what

407
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
works for you and like

408
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
i don't like going after recon and

409
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
what's out there i want to attack the

410
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,560
main website

411
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,439
so at this point i've checked in i've

412
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
got one bug

413
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,480
and i'm now adding an in-flight meal i

414
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,959
am now

415
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
checking in changing my seats i'm i'm

416
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,399
doing everything possible

417
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,560
i can clicking everything possible

418
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,920
changing user agent because maybe mobile

419
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,160
app has got something different

420
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,279
to the desktop app chances are it has

421
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
because companies

422
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
where they know everyone's on their

423
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,200
mobile phone rather than their computers

424
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
these days

425
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
um and again i feel like that's one

426
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
major thing that a lot of bug hunters

427
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
miss

428
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,560
is they'll find a bug or potentially a

429
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
bug but they'll never actually then

430
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
simply visit the mobile version of the

431
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,000
website or the actual get the mobile app

432
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,359
because i will explain it a bit later

433
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
but most mobile apps

434
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
are like seriously vulnerable because i

435
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,760
feel like a lot of developers don't

436
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,120
realize that we can actually see what's

437
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
happening behind the scenes they

438
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
assume oh well no one can actually hack

439
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,639
this phone but yeah

440
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,800
i'll get into that um so i'm looking in

441
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,399
every single javascript fan this is why

442
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,760
i always say to people i will spend

443
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
months and months on the same program

444
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
because when you are

445
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
when you've got like 50 60 old end

446
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
points it can take a long time to go

447
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,720
through all of these

448
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,719
and understand what is working how is it

449
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,040
working what's actually still live

450
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
and so again this can take me weeks and

451
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,719
months and yeah i'm still

452
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
attacking a lot of websites still um and

453
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,399
from finding the first bug i'm simply

454
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
searching these javascript files for as

455
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,079
many references to booking

456
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,279
reference as i possibly can and this is

457
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
where i always tell people

458
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
a custom word list comes in handy

459
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
because you can go on set lists and

460
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
download a word list which is fair

461
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
enough

462
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,199
but a lot of websites will change

463
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,720
parameter names

464
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,439
to be like a shorter version of

465
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
something um so say for example address

466
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
id might be a id

467
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,240
so that a is short for address and so as

468
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,079
you're looking through the website you

469
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
should always be taking notes as to what

470
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,638
parameter names are

471
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
and be creating different variations of

472
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
them things like that because then when

473
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,719
you do find

474
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,479
api endpoints simply trying these

475
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
parameters you found elsewhere

476
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,320
might actually work on this endpoint

477
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,199
chances are they will

478
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
um and yeah pretty simple again i only

479
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,000
hack with burp everyone's familiar with

480
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,639
burp suite i presume

481
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
well those are the hacking so burp suite

482
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
is a proxy tool from portswigger you can

483
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,760
get the free edition and i use the free

484
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
edition for a year when hacking in

485
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
bounties because

486
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,560
i don't use any extensions really and

487
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,240
the only

488
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,839
good thing i find about the professional

489
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
is to collaborate around the intruder

490
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,120
there's no

491
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,959
limits to it and the main thing i always

492
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
tell people with hacking is to just have

493
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,719
fun

494
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
um especially if you're doing bug

495
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,320
bounties don't chase the money don't

496
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
think i'm gonna go just find an rce and

497
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
try and get a 10k payout

498
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
yeah in my opinion to be a successful

499
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,160
hacker you have to actually

500
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,680
enjoy hacking a search it's the puzzle

501
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
it's the challenge you actually want to

502
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
try and

503
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
break it as such rather than just

504
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,519
thinking cha-ching

505
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,399
um which again i feel like a lot of

506
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,760
people do do

507
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
so it ended with seven critical bugs

508
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
again

509
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,560
and any single one of you in this room

510
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
can load up an airline website and

511
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
replicate exactly what i've done i've

512
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
just booked a flight

513
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,199
logged the requests and any time i saw

514
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,360
my booking reference

515
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,719
i changed it to someone else's it's not

516
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,560
hard anyone can do it um

517
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,720
and so yeah i will that's what it was so

518
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,680
i could literally they're all idol bugs

519
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,519
but from a main web application that is

520
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,079
live that people are still using to this

521
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,199
day

522
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,719
is shocking in my opinion um

523
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,560
and that's something that i do really

524
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,360
want to try and do in

525
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,439
this year um is teach developers and

526
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
companies how to hack themselves because

527
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
a lot of com

528
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
companies have been sold the idea well

529
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
open a bug bounty program and you'll be

530
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,839
told about all these bugs

531
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,040
and then you can work out what to do and

532
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,199
go fix it

533
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
but what ends up what ends up happening

534
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,160
is people like me

535
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,079
who do it full time we're like okay

536
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
we'll go hack you we end up finding 30

537
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,439
40 bugs in a week and then the company's

538
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,800
like whoa

539
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,320
okay what do we do now like we've got a

540
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
big problem here and then they start

541
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
having to ask well we're actually

542
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
decommissioning that next week so should

543
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,560
we actually fix it and yeah it becomes

544
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
in my opinion

545
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,758
language a fest basically and i've

546
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
been at some of these companies where

547
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800
they're just like we don't know what to

548
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
do

549
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
so that's what i really want to teach

550
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
companies and especially

551
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
um qa teams dev team security teams and

552
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,359
i

553
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,800
really encourage companies to internally

554
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,279
run their own hackathons

555
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,560
hacking your own code because there's so

556
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,079
much benefit from teaching your

557
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,599
developers how to hack themselves

558
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,479
because then when they're creating code

559
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
and features

560
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
if they can have in the back of their

561
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
mindset oh two weeks ago we was hacking

562
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,959
on a website

563
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,800
and so there was a bug so and so maybe i

564
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,638
should just verify it and what have you

565
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,040
and the same with qa teams i don't

566
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,720
understand how websites that hold

567
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
people's powerful information can go

568
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
live when somebody at this company

569
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,920
hasn't sat there for

570
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
should we try anyone's booking reference

571
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,720
and see if it works um

572
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,039
yeah they left it to me um and then on

573
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
the same program so after some recon so

574
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,319
again once i've actually cleaned up

575
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
a main web application there's not a lot

576
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,678
left for me to actually focus on

577
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,679
um now my recon includes pretty much the

578
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
basic subdomain scanning so you find

579
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
subdomains exposed to the internet

580
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,520
um and i mainly do a lot of google

581
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,120
docking and github talking

582
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,960
um because if you're searching for

583
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,399
especially because now i have so much

584
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
knowledge on this website from hacking

585
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,679
on it for two three weeks

586
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
i know caramel are named used i know

587
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,640
endpoints use i know everything

588
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
basically

589
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
then when i'm asking google questions

590
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
like hey what do you know about this

591
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
company because here's the little bits i

592
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
know about it can you pieces

593
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,399
piece of bits together and that's when

594
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
you start talking for like

595
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
site whatever example.com in url and

596
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,679
you're looking for certain endpoints

597
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,918
parameters

598
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,880
and that's then also where i go to

599
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,559
wayback machine

600
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,880
and this is something that i feel

601
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,960
a lot of researchers do do but you'll

602
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,960
way back machine is an absolute goldmine

603
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
for old bugs basically

604
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,320
so back when google was first up coming

605
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it was popular to have a robot.txt file

606
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,918
everyone was do you need a robot.txt

607
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
file you need to tell google what not to

608
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,679
index it etc

609
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,879
um and then as time has gone on people

610
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,720
have been like uh we'll get rid of

611
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
robots we'll change a few things

612
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
remove some files and what have you

613
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,760
whereas if you go on wayback machine

614
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,918
and you type in any website so let's say

615
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,240
for example tripadvisor.com for

616
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
robots.txt when i did run it on

617
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
tripadvisor

618
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
in their current robots file they've

619
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,760
only got like 100 endpoints but one

620
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,160
scraping seven years worth of data it

621
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
ended at 7 000 endpoints

622
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,760
then from that because i've got all

623
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
these parameter names i can now math

624
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
test for as many bugs as i want and

625
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
yeah that's how you overload teams who

626
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,199
basically aren't ready

627
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,440
um it only ended with three other bugs

628
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,760
where there was a github repo again

629
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
github is public anyone can go on it and

630
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,440
search for anything you possibly want

631
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,719
and there is still to this day

632
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,559
so many api tokens passwords

633
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,559
internal everything you can find

634
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,799
everything on github

635
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,720
i mean there's a very popular food chain

636
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,600
and they're currently still leaking

637
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
an api token to download the source code

638
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
to all of their apps

639
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,799
um what you'd find from the unknown

640
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,360
source go who knows

641
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,320
um sadly there was a plain text password

642
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,240
league as well

643
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
people sadly are still doing that and

644
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,080
then just an

645
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
outskirt bug which was basically there

646
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,240
was an idol bug

647
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
in the same area but i could query

648
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,760
employee data

649
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
so again applying the same concept of an

650
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,679
idol bug for creating anyone's data

651
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
or can i get employee data and now

652
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
suddenly i'm not only affecting their

653
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,760
user data but i'm getting

654
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
employees um so everyone pretty

655
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,320
understanding and pretty scared of using

656
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,760
their lives

657
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,039
so this is the one where i feel like

658
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,320
people might get a bit scared because

659
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
people are students and a lot of people

660
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,639
are applying for jobs

661
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
now i didn't realize this when i got

662
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,039
invited to this program

663
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,200
that a lot of websites out there use the

664
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,600
same company for hosting their careers

665
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
page

666
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,679
and a lot of websites are vulnerable to

667
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
this

668
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
so it was very simple you could sign up

669
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,959
for an account

670
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,960
you could upload your cv tell them your

671
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
skills and look for available jobs

672
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
pretty straightforward right everyone's

673
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,760
done it

674
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
so the first thing that brings to my

675
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,400
mind is well obviously i

676
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,000
could upload my own cv so i got a shell

677
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,679
um that was the first

678
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
indication like this is gonna be quite

679
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,520
bad but

680
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,440
the main thing is and my focus is can i

681
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,918
leak other users data

682
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,200
and how is data actually stored when i'm

683
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,559
applying for a job so when you're

684
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
actually telling them hey this is my

685
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,840
name this is what

686
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,799
when somebody reviews this later on what

687
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
are they actually

688
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
gonna see basically so maybe i'll be

689
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,840
able to inject some blind xss payloads

690
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,158
or something like that

691
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,600
um so round two of hacking anyone have

692
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,600
any guesses

693
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,918
what probably gonna be vulnerable like

694
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,439
anyone think what might happen

695
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,640
no one okay it's pretty simple again

696
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
so there was a feature to export my

697
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,000
profile

698
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,600
so once you you signed up for an account

699
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,360
you've uploaded your cv

700
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,918
for some reason they'll let you export

701
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,678
this and i'm presuming

702
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,120
i don't know why if i'm honest why you'd

703
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,600
want to export it all but

704
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,840
i don't know now anyone have any idea

705
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,918
what this request might be vulnerable to

706
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,158
so it's a simple post request and it was

707
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,000
to export candidates travelers

708
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
and there was a json request and it had

709
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,159
candidates and there's a number there

710
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,080
247 830. now that's my candidate id

711
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,360
so when i send the request it gives me a

712
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,559
csv format

713
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
of all of my data now if i simply change

714
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,440
that to

715
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,239
any other number i've got that person's

716
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
details

717
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
so if i change it to candidate id number

718
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
one i've got the

719
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,200
first ever person who signed up and like

720
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,039
i say i was id number 247 so

721
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,760
247 000 other people applying for jobs

722
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,200
on here

723
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,879
and i can query all of your data

724
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
literally i've done nothing apart from

725
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,280
signing up for an account and click a

726
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
few buttons

727
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,080
and it's right there so i'm thinking

728
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,799
looks pretty interesting

729
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
now yeah i've just explained it before

730
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
i've

731
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
added it on here but yeah like i said

732
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,840
simply changing candidate id to another

733
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
id and

734
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,959
the key thing is whenever you see

735
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,320
numbers like this and they're

736
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,400
referenced by a candidate id address id

737
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,039
something that is tagged to the id

738
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
always try for an ideal vulnerability

739
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,240
and

740
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,559
i'll get to some tips as to how to do

741
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,960
that in a little bit um

742
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,799
and sadly i have to tell them that i

743
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,440
mean you've got a site-wide problem

744
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,240
of um indirect people know what idol

745
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
bugs is

746
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
i've gone into this museum everyone

747
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,799
knows what an idol bug is so an idol is

748
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
indirect object reference so your id

749
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
number one

750
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,240
you shouldn't be able to query the

751
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,840
private details of id number two it

752
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,440
should give you an error but if you can

753
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,760
then you've got a bug basically

754
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
something as simple as changing a number

755
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,600
um

756
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,918
i found five bugs from 10 minutes of

757
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,639
looking and bearing in mind right

758
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
top 500 company fortune companies in the

759
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,760
world

760
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
use this company for their careers page

761
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
so

762
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
some of your information might be on

763
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,600
there um

764
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,039
not only that but there was bugs to

765
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,520
change people's passwords

766
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,120
reveal passwords i could delete your cv

767
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,520
i could change your cv

768
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,199
change skills and this is again there's

769
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,679
no master hacking done here in my

770
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,679
opinion

771
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,440
i've not got my hood up i've got the

772
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,720
black screen i've got the green writing

773
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
and the math typing

774
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
i've literally just been clicking around

775
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,039
tried to export my profile

776
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
and seen an interesting id and changed

777
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,120
it it

778
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:51,679
literally is not hard in my opinion

779
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,799
so everyone pretty understanding of that

780
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,400
um so i've been hacking

781
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,000
for now well i've been doing bug

782
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,159
bounties for about five

783
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
six years now um i've been hacking

784
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,120
wow i've mean i'm self-lifestyle i'm

785
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
self-taught i don't have any

786
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,360
qualifications nothing like that i just

787
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,120
told myself how to hack sort of thing um

788
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,240
and everyone always says xss

789
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,879
is an internet problem i believe idols

790
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
are a very very big problem the fact

791
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,640
that i can get invited

792
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,320
to a brand new um bug bounty program and

793
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
it's familiar name

794
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
and you can find all of these bugs in

795
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
minutes

796
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,639
and it's like how so

797
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
from doing bug bounties for about like

798
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,279
say five or six years

799
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
um and considering what i'm going to

800
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,320
show you in a minute just think about

801
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,240
how many companies out there

802
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
don't welcome people like me to poke at

803
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
their systems especially banks they

804
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,600
absolutely hate us

805
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,120
there's probably an idol bug on there to

806
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,399
send money from someone's account in my

807
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,959
opinion because

808
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
they're everywhere um so they're all

809
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,919
these are the interesting bugs i've

810
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
found over the years and this is what i

811
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,880
call

812
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,080
called it saving user data because i've

813
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,679
been able to

814
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,559
query millions and millions of user data

815
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,360
and i mean that's including facebook

816
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,200
information

817
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,039
like access tokens if you've allowed an

818
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,840
app and things like that um

819
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,559
plain text passwords address full name

820
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,279
emails

821
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
the absolute lot and this is again for

822
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,960
only companies who

823
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
are allowing me to basically pack on

824
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,440
them

825
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,200
and i strongly believe every single

826
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,520
person in this room can find the exact

827
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
same bugs i have is literally as simple

828
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,039
as you see

829
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,840
your id your request change it to

830
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
someone else's

831
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,399
check the response nine times out of ten

832
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
you're gonna have a hit and you're gonna

833
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,559
be successful in my opinion

834
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
um so anymore any questions about

835
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,440
anything i have spoken about so far

836
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
everyone pretty understand how to use a

837
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
website click on a few things change

838
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,199
some values

839
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
it's not rocket science is it

840
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,840
um and i mean like i say these are all p

841
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,039
ones i mean they're paying out minimum

842
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,678
10 grand

843
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,279
i'm earning people's salary in a week

844
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
like this is like their yearly salary in

845
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,480
a week from

846
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
simply changing some numbers and this is

847
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
why i believe

848
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,959
yes bug monthly programs are very

849
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,240
efficient for companies

850
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,760
but you need to have like those layers

851
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
of defense first and the bug back you

852
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,158
program should come last

853
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,840
because then if you do have a bug

854
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,000
mounting program and you get a bug

855
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,520
report for an idol or an xss

856
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,679
instead of okay we'll fix it here's 500

857
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,559
oh we've got another one 500 it should

858
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,840
be

859
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,918
why was we vulnerable to this in the

860
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,279
first place what's gone wrong here

861
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,360
how can we prevent this from happening

862
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
again and that then

863
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,959
a bug bounty program complements your

864
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,879
security because then

865
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
um security researchers like me are

866
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
simply not just changing numbers and

867
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
being like oh another one another one i

868
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
mean

869
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
look at how i'm listing these i'm just

870
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
putting another

871
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,399
there was a vlog somewhere i was like

872
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,320
there's another one there's another one

873
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
um and instead then like i said a

874
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,120
bookmarking program can complement their

875
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
security already because they can be

876
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,799
like okay

877
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,480
what's actually gone wrong here and

878
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,080
they're challenging people like me and

879
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,640
then you're gonna get more high quality

880
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,799
reports rather than just xss xss xss

881
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,039
over and over again

882
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,960
um so for those of you who are learning

883
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,600
to hack and want to go find all these

884
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
bugs

885
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,799
um these are my tips for looking for

886
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
idols basically

887
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,039
um i do have like say my methodology and

888
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,320
my platform coming out um

889
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,640
i should probably explain a little bit

890
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,879
about that i guess so for those of you

891
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,360
who weren't familiar with what

892
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,760
bugbountynotes.com was

893
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,479
um it was kind of for the community by

894
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
the community

895
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
so bugs that i'm finding on actual bug

896
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,640
money programs i would then code it up

897
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,039
into a real website and like replicate

898
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
it

899
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,919
and then basically say look what can you

900
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,399
find here to teach people the mindset as

901
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
to

902
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,320
what they're looking for and what to try

903
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,240
for and then i'd post a solution

904
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,439
and so the idea behind the new platform

905
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
is um

906
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,679
and i've not told anyone this so it's

907
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,840
just yeah new to people

908
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,799
so bog about your notes was there's an

909
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,480
xss here

910
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,918
can you find it can you bypass the

911
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,799
filter um

912
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,679
but instead now i've spent the last two

913
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,840
months or so

914
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,520
i've literally created an entire website

915
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,678
which is probably as big as amazon

916
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,120
with so many features and it fully works

917
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,279
sign up for an account

918
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,199
and along with my methodology and my

919
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,279
training videos and content i'm hoping

920
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,039
people can basically read this

921
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
and then go practice instantly on an

922
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,799
actual real functioning website with

923
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,678
real replicated bugs to get their

924
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,520
mindset

925
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,240
i get it sort of thing and then you go

926
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,279
apply on bug body programs and hopefully

927
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,360
you'll do well so

928
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,200
the first tip is a json request

929
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,600
everyone's familiar what json requests

930
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,399
are

931
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,840
um so you've got their example being

932
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,879
defined by example

933
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,678
so simply just try inject your own

934
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,520
parameter

935
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,919
and see what gets processed so you can

936
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,320
see that i've put in red id equals one

937
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,080
so

938
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,080
imagine there's a request i'll use

939
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,320
tripadvisor as an example again

940
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,559
there was a request to add someone as

941
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,720
admin to your hotel

942
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,399
and there was no id sent in the request

943
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,679
at all however

944
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,639
if you simply added id and then another

945
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
hotel id

946
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
it added you to that hotel and you were

947
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,440
now admin of another hotel

948
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,720
so that's in my opinion i usually have

949
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
the highest success rate

950
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,799
i mean you can try injecting parameters

951
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,720
on every request but i typically have

952
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,279
the most successful json requests

953
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
i'm not quite sure why if i'm honest i'm

954
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,720
guessing how things are passed

955
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,200
server-side and i don't know

956
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
um so yeah simply try and again this is

957
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
where your word list comes in handy

958
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
because

959
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,919
once you've been looking at a main web

960
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,158
application and you've got all these

961
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
notes written down and parameter names

962
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,919
you can simply run it through intruder

963
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
and try 10 different

964
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,720
variations of an id number and see see

965
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,918
what happens basically

966
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,039
mobile apps i like to say i usually have

967
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,760
a 99

968
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,679
success rate with a mobile app because

969
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,120
you'll open your mobile app i mean let

970
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
me think of an example

971
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,039
i mean i will use amazon as an example

972
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,799
they're not actually vulnerable to this

973
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,720
but i use amazon so imagine you open

974
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,559
amazon up and you're logged in

975
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,480
and you visit your profile on amazon and

976
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,320
it loads up your information

977
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,520
now when you've got burp suite attached

978
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,120
to your phone you're logging the

979
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
requests from that

980
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
usually the request is just api dot

981
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,279
example

982
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,279
forward slash user and your id and then

983
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,600
it's usually a json reply with all you

984
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,840
all of your information simply changing

985
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
that id to someone else's

986
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,240
you've got all of their information

987
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,000
again and

988
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,840
i like to think that it's because

989
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,480
developers don't really

990
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,480
realize that we can see the requests i'm

991
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,200
not quite sure why why mobile apps are

992
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,120
so

993
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,440
vulnerable to it but yeah i usually have

994
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,439
a very high success rate of mobile apps

995
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
and to test mobile apps the real simple

996
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,799
way quickly five minute

997
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,960
is if you've got burp suite installed in

998
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,440
your computer and you've got your phone

999
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,440
um simply change the wi-fi settings to

1000
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,200
point to your local ip on the computer

1001
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,080
where bert's running

1002
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,799
and then visit http and install the

1003
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
certificate

1004
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,679
and if they've got ssl pinning then

1005
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,120
you're going to need some way there's

1006
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,000
lots of tutorials out there and there's

1007
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,760
not enough time to

1008
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,440
give all the tutorials on that but there

1009
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,320
are ways to get rid of ssl pinning and

1010
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
things like that

1011
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,360
and then simply simply when you are

1012
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,279
clicking things on your phone

1013
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,639
you'll see the requests on your computer

1014
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,320
and you can have a little play

1015
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,720
um and honestly try it with some of the

1016
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,399
apps you've got on your phone and

1017
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,559
you i mean i'm not even saying change

1018
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,158
the numbers but generally just uh

1019
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,519
connect verb and have a look at a lot of

1020
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,240
these apps and you will see these

1021
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,440
numbers

1022
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,600
um obviously if you don't have

1023
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,960
permission don't be changing numbers

1024
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,678
don't go to jail but if you've got

1025
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,679
permission

1026
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
yeah but there's no harm in just having

1027
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,200
a look and saying oh

1028
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,799
there's the number sean's on about and

1029
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,039
yeah

1030
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,200
um so looking for features that use save

1031
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,519
data so it's pretty self-explanatory

1032
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
um but coming from a developer think

1033
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,960
about how

1034
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,000
so an example is when you sign up for a

1035
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,679
website and you

1036
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,880
put your payment details in usually they

1037
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,440
want your billing address as well don't

1038
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,840
they

1039
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
now if you've got an account on a

1040
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,799
website

1041
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,720
where you've already got your address

1042
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,639
chances are they might say hey

1043
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,919
are any of your current addresses you've

1044
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,120
already got in your address book your

1045
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,559
billing address

1046
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,559
and usually then when you click on the

1047
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,360
address or you click on whatever type of

1048
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,080
item it is

1049
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,719
they'll it will be defined by just an id

1050
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,399
um

1051
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,000
and again it's as simple as changing

1052
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,959
that id

1053
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,559
and i know a lot of you are probably

1054
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,919
thinking well what about the id is

1055
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,440
encrypted and things like that

1056
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,440
um there's lots of ways around this

1057
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,559
so first of all what ids are available

1058
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,039
on public pages

1059
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,158
um so another example on tripadvisor i

1060
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,679
mean it is fixed

1061
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,600
um did a function well for some company

1062
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,000
is there was a vulnerability where i

1063
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,959
could delete anyone's photo basically

1064
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,320
um however it was defined by a good like

1065
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,320
guid you know

1066
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,918
that is um and

1067
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,279
i thought to myself well you can't

1068
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
actually generate these you can't

1069
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,919
enumerate these this isn't guessable

1070
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,559
it's vulnerable to idol but how am i

1071
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,240
actually going to get this value

1072
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,158
and this is where again using the main

1073
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,919
web application comes in handy in your

1074
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,919
notes because i found out

1075
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
that when you uploaded a photo and then

1076
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,720
you viewed the html source of your

1077
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,080
profile

1078
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
the value was saved with um the file

1079
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
path

1080
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,519
so it was whatever cdn and a few random

1081
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,439
characters and they'd have the value

1082
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,200
and then whatever your photo was called

1083
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,279
and yeah it sounds a bit like

1084
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,799
huh okay so let me go to someone else's

1085
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,399
profile like one of my other test

1086
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,279
accounts and i was like okay there's the

1087
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,199
value

1088
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,679
let's try delete it and yeah the profile

1089
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
photo was deleted so even if you do see

1090
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
encrypted values and things like that

1091
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,799
look for places that it's going to be

1092
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,158
leaked and that's again where you start

1093
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,519
looking in javascript files

1094
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
start looking for references and things

1095
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,080
like that um

1096
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,519
security through obscurity the people

1097
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,960
know what that's that is

1098
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,519
um so for those of you don't basically

1099
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,000
imagine you've got a number one two

1100
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,799
three

1101
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,080
and a base64 encoded the value so when

1102
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,240
the request was said you

1103
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,120
saw just letters and numbers and things

1104
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,760
and

1105
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,959
maybe someone who's new they might think

1106
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,879
i don't know what that is

1107
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,360
i'll miss that whereas if they just

1108
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,399
base64 decoded it it would tell them

1109
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,520
one two three so i've had a

1110
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,839
lot of companies who will have a bunch

1111
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
of

1112
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,599
gobbledygooks basically and i'm just

1113
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,599
like

1114
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,760
like this random characters random

1115
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,359
numbers and there's no special pattern

1116
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
it's just completely random and i'm

1117
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,078
thinking to myself

1118
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,520
huh this is odd um and one thing

1119
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
whenever you see that

1120
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
is think to yourself okay so the

1121
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,199
company's gone to this much effort but

1122
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
did they actually protect against idol

1123
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,279
so you sign up for another account grab

1124
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,759
your encrypted value and try it on

1125
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,399
account number one just to test for idol

1126
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,079
um sometimes it works sometimes it

1127
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,799
doesn't but if it does work then you

1128
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,200
know okay

1129
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,079
this is actually vulnerable to idol and

1130
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,000
if you can't find

1131
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,359
anywhere to leak it what about if you

1132
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,679
just simply tried

1133
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,359
a number so instead of wanting to get

1134
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,000
this encrypted value so imagine it said

1135
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,918
address dot

1136
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,160
address id equals and it was a bunch of

1137
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,960
goblet imagine if you just simply tried

1138
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,720
address id

1139
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
equals one you ignored all of the

1140
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,078
encryption and all the obscurity and you

1141
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,520
just simply tried a number

1142
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,079
chances are it might work um i actually

1143
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,119
found

1144
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
15 of these vulnerabilities on a company

1145
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,680
that shouldn't have had these

1146
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
vulnerabilities on

1147
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
because every single value they were

1148
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,800
just encrypted

1149
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,000
but they was all vulnerable to idol

1150
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
because they obviously thought to

1151
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,480
themselves

1152
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,118
potentially they knew they had a

1153
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,800
site-wide problem and they thought

1154
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,880
they'd monkey patch it by encrypting

1155
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,560
these values to put off people maybe

1156
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,560
um but yeah if you ever see these

1157
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,240
encrypted values you cannot go wrong by

1158
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,920
just simply trying a number

1159
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,560
it just works sometimes um

1160
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,160
so one parameter vulnerable to idol

1161
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,759
usually means there'll be more to find

1162
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
so like i say when i was hacking on this

1163
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,079
passenger

1164
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,200
um airline website i found one eye door

1165
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
um a lot of bug hunters will go from bug

1166
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,078
to bug

1167
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,279
so they'll be looking for exercise and

1168
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,040
then they'll suddenly try and open

1169
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,800
redirects and then they'll suddenly try

1170
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,560
this um

1171
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,280
and i find with that it can actually

1172
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,960
burn you out a lot because

1173
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
i don't know your mind's just all over

1174
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
the place so i like to

1175
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
obviously when i'm clicking through

1176
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,200
these features

1177
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,400
obviously you're logging everything that

1178
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,160
happens but i primarily go in with the

1179
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
intention of wanting to find one set of

1180
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,440
vulnerability class to begin with

1181
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,520
because

1182
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,200
i mean i want to get a census to this

1183
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,960
company's security so if i was to hack

1184
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,520
arbiter hackers for example

1185
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
i my first thought is well do they have

1186
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,680
student accounts

1187
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,078
and if they do that means student data

1188
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,919
so

1189
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
and if that do have student accounts

1190
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,200
chances are they'll have some sort of

1191
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,920
employee account staff account admin

1192
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,759
account

1193
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,920
um so i'm not going to be bothered about

1194
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,200
xss and trying to get someone's details

1195
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,880
via that i'm going to start

1196
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
looking at okay well if i reset my

1197
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,520
password is there an id in the request

1198
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,759
to define what user's password to reset

1199
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,720
if i'm actually changing my account

1200
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,880
information

1201
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,399
um i mean i could i'm going a little bit

1202
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,560
off board here but it goes back

1203
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,680
to um the json request so

1204
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,599
as well as just trying for idols um

1205
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,480
there was a blog post released where if

1206
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,119
you simply see something that says false

1207
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,880
change it to true um because say for

1208
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,880
example it says admin false

1209
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,880
when you're updating your student

1210
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,000
information if you simply change that to

1211
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,240
like admin true

1212
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,920
it might actually be processed and there

1213
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,919
was a really good blog post i believe i

1214
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,000
retweeted a couple of weeks ago

1215
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
uh where you can automate it in birth

1216
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,359
and any time it sees faults it will

1217
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
replace it the true you might break the

1218
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,359
website

1219
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,280
but a lot of people have found bugs

1220
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,880
where they're testing new website

1221
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,800
like layouts before they've even come

1222
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
live and they're able to change their

1223
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,720
account privileges and yeah

1224
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
um yeah of topic a little bit

1225
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,720
so yeah like i said one ideal mistake

1226
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,520
usually leads to many many more

1227
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,200
um and yeah i'm basically getting

1228
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,560
towards the end and i like answering

1229
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
questions and helping people learn to

1230
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,279
hack

1231
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,800
so i guess we've got like 15 minutes and

1232
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,480
i won't hack your ex or anything

1233
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,920
like that but does anyone have any

1234
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,960
questions or

1235
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,960
anything yeah

1236
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,200
when i first started hacking um there

1237
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,079
wasn't really anywhere to practice on in

1238
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,919
my opinion

1239
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
so it was like i was kind of just

1240
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,599
practicing on any website

1241
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,040
such that doesn't sound good but it's

1242
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,800
not like i was hacking

1243
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,640
maliciously as such i was just poking

1244
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
around a little bit and that's when i

1245
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,160
reached out to the companies and got

1246
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,040
permission and things like that

1247
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,759
but in this day and age ideally you can

1248
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,520
practice

1249
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,640
on vdps bug money programs you've got

1250
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,680
hack the box

1251
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,879
um ports wiggers pen test lab web

1252
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
web websec academy um yeah all the great

1253
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,599
resources online that's where i

1254
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
recommend people learn really

1255
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,359
and my platform as well when it comes

1256
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,359
out

1257
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,000
oh yes sorry she asked me um if where

1258
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,680
did i learn to hack basically

1259
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,839
when i was first starting out because i

1260
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,520
was self-taught and yeah that's the

1261
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:12,320
answer

1262
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,320
with some of these companies

1263
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,119
have

1264
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,359
[Music]

1265
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,879
um so the question was um the time i've

1266
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,520
been reporting bugs have companies

1267
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,079
improved their security basically

1268
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,359
it depends on the company um some

1269
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,920
companies just chuck money at the

1270
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,000
problem

1271
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,119
and they incentivize researchers like me

1272
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,800
by saying well hey look we're going to

1273
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,240
pay you 10 times more money

1274
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,400
go find more bugs um

1275
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,919
and i i guess it really does depend

1276
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,480
because i've had some companies where

1277
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,800
they've

1278
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
i mean i'm again from reading javascript

1279
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,920
files you can find features that are

1280
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,200
actually coming out before they've come

1281
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,320
out because they're referenced in the

1282
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,480
javascript file

1283
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,400
but there's nothing on the website about

1284
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,880
it and i actually found a bug like that

1285
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,079
whereas

1286
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
i mean i've been hacking this company

1287
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,000
for about a year now and i was finding

1288
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,960
loads of idols and xss and things like

1289
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,440
that and they

1290
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,160
documented this new code for certain

1291
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,400
people i was

1292
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,759
almost about to say a big company then

1293
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,200
um

1294
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,280
and it was basically vulnerable to idols

1295
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,919
so it depends on the company really but

1296
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,599
i

1297
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,359
at the moment i say it's quite slim in

1298
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,760
my opinion that's why i want to really

1299
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,119
get

1300
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
into these companies and i've reached

1301
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,480
out to a few british companies and i am

1302
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,319
slowly making my way

1303
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,319
into helping them but i really want to

1304
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,800
teach developers security teams and

1305
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,759
companies how to hack themselves rather

1306
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
than relying on

1307
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,119
outsourced people basically that should

1308
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
come last in my opinion they should be

1309
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,760
really testing your stuff not

1310
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,960
making making making a joke basically

1311
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,400
because that's in my opinion that's what

1312
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,000
a lot of researchers do they're laughing

1313
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,079
behind a lot of company scenes like well

1314
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,040
this is our personal atm machine here

1315
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,560
and

1316
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,240
that shouldn't be what it should be

1317
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,640
really but yeah

1318
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,839
anyone know yeah did you have a question

1319
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,960
about

1320
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,279
uh the regular fantastic you know

1321
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,400
these companies also have uh so you've

1322
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,839
mentioned

1323
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,839
uh so i'm a pentester okay

1324
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,880
one good advantage about blood valves is

1325
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,800
something you

1326
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,800
rush on which is the amount of time that

1327
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,280
you have to test yeah

1328
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,119
and this are usually very limited in

1329
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,599
terms of time

1330
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,880
um so the techniques are essentially the

1331
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,680
same yeah

1332
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,040
we just try to cram as much as we can

1333
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,960
within sort of like the

1334
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,960
three days that we have

1335
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,319
[Music]

1336
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,680
like i say i believe they should come

1337
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,480
last because

1338
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,319
instead of you waking up and being like

1339
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,119
we've had a p1 and everyone panicking

1340
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,040
and fixing it

1341
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,160
it should be like how did this happen

1342
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
like

1343
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,799
you should be able to like say i believe

1344
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,000
companies should run potentially

1345
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,599
internal hackathons where you're

1346
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,960
teaching developers and security teams

1347
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,560
and qa teams

1348
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,880
how to hack themselves change certain

1349
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,119
values and put certain things like xss

1350
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,280
try this try that because once i can get

1351
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,280
the core basic down then when you do

1352
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,040
later on open a bug banner program like

1353
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,079
say when you receive a report it's not

1354
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,960
just going to be

1355
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,400
here's 500 for xss fixed oh we've got

1356
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,800
another one coming in from someone else

1357
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,960
we'll give him 500 fixed it should be

1358
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,920
how did this exercise slip through our

1359
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
filters and

1360
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,240
whatever else we've got in place really

1361
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,400
um i didn't repeat the question again

1362
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,598
it was uh

1363
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,880
[Applause]

1364
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,319
what was the end language

1365
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,880
is it what i was going to say

1366
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,079
sort of the final question yes do you

1367
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,160
think blood boundaries

1368
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,200
are sustainable for security researchers

1369
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,960
in the sense

1370
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,078
that obviously you can't survive on them

1371
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,960
now is it something that is sustainable

1372
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,960
for the future

1373
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,920
okay so he asked does he think bounties

1374
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:04,560
is sustainable um

1375
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,680
that's a good question um in my opinion

1376
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,000
probably not because like i say

1377
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,118
i'm hoping companies are gonna get at

1378
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
the end of the day

1379
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,800
pissed off at how many reports are still

1380
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,000
coming in

1381
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,000
um the only problem is with bug bounties

1382
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,160
is you've got

1383
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,680
i won't name platforms and companies and

1384
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,480
what have you but you've got platforms

1385
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,078
and companies

1386
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,240
like you need a bookmarking program

1387
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,560
we're paying out so much this is so good

1388
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,839
and some companies who aren't too clued

1389
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,759
up and security are getting

1390
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,640
sucked into that without realizing um

1391
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,000
so sustainable in a way but probably

1392
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
they probably won't earn you as much

1393
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,520
money as they have been doing over the

1394
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,118
last few years really um

1395
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,400
and i mean i mean a lot of people have

1396
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,599
sold the idea that bug bounties are

1397
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,560
gonna make you millionaires but the

1398
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,400
problem that

1399
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,400
a certain platform doesn't tell everyone

1400
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,160
is all of those seven millionaires have

1401
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,760
become millionaires from live events

1402
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,279
pretty much because

1403
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,119
you report a bug to one of these

1404
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,640
companies who isn't running a live event

1405
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,920
you're gonna get like five grand

1406
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,160
you hold it for one of these events

1407
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,920
you're gonna get 25 grand so of course

1408
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,118
these people stockpile as many bugs as

1409
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,760
possible and that's why people like

1410
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,160
doggy g will walk away 180 grand in one

1411
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
day

1412
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,160
whereas i'll do the same work and report

1413
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,440
it to a normal program and just get 10k

1414
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,240
and i'm like um so sort of sustainable

1415
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,160
sort of night

1416
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,359
again it depends on the company again

1417
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,720
there's so many companies who are

1418
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,000
opening programs that shouldn't be

1419
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,200
opening programs

1420
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,520
one of the things that i'm thinking

1421
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,000
about is so imagine they pay

1422
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,640
500 or whatever yeah for a buck

1423
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,839
if you think about it maybe companies

1424
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,040
will rely on

1425
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,759
pro public programs instead of regular

1426
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,240
pen testing

1427
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,319
because it's cheaper for them yeah

1428
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,479
because you just say okay

1429
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,599
in your own time within the next three

1430
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,040
months

1431
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,040
sort of you have three months to look

1432
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,640
it's definitely a lot cheaper but again

1433
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,400
you've also got to keep researchers

1434
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,480
interested i mean

1435
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,240
if i have a bad experience one program

1436
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,280
that's it you've gone and then what

1437
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,399
i mean what's happening they're not

1438
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,720
actually getting anything and that's

1439
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,319
when you see bug money programs who's

1440
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,759
paying a thousand dollars are now

1441
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,599
suddenly paying five thousand dollars

1442
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
because they want to re-incentivize you

1443
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,040
to

1444
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,040
get back in really um so yeah cool

1445
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,319
so if you've checked if they've got a

1446
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,480
security.text file um

1447
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,480
ed overflow and he's trying to get a new

1448
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,079
standard that if companies want to

1449
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,359
receive reports as such they'll have a

1450
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,280
security.txt file

1451
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,640
on their website the same way as a

1452
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,440
robot.txt

1453
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,720
um i don't recommend tweeting out to

1454
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,079
them or any or

1455
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,359
i don't really recommend reaching out to

1456
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,480
their customer service team either

1457
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,319
because most people

1458
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,839
customer service companies are like

1459
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,319
you've hacked us like what should we be

1460
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,680
calling the police or something um

1461
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,520
try and find their cisco on twitter um

1462
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,040
or linkedin and things like that usually

1463
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,759
you'll find some sort of personal email

1464
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,359
and

1465
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,720
usually what i've done for bugs that

1466
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,400
i've found in the past where there's no

1467
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,359
like official way to report it is i'll

1468
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,520
just simply say hey

1469
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,440
here's who i am i come in peace i found

1470
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,880
the vulnerability and just detail what

1471
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,480
you've found and

1472
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,079
johnny they've got it and they can do

1473
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,520
whatever never ask for money or anything

1474
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
like that if they want to offer it you

1475
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,400
after

1476
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:29,839
then they might but never say hey pay me

1477
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,839
and i'll give you the bug really um

1478
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,050
[Music]

1479
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,720
so he asked me how much time would i

1480
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,640
spend on a website and

1481
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,919
go down the rabbit hole i get asked that

1482
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,640
quite a lot and

1483
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,079
in all honesty there's no time limit um

1484
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,200
it's not like a football game where

1485
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,960
there's a certain period then you've got

1486
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,480
to go have a break i

1487
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
it just comes with experience i guess

1488
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,839
the longer you are hacking and the more

1489
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,040
bugs you've been finding it just

1490
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,040
tweaks in your head although you just

1491
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,720
get that gut feeling and sometimes i can

1492
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,319
spend hours and hours

1493
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,598
usually after four or five hours and i'm

1494
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,040
getting a headache i'll probably write

1495
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,599
it down in my notes and come back to it

1496
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,520
later

1497
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,880
um but in all honesty don't put a time

1498
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,000
limit on hacking really

1499
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,599
don't mean that's why i say have fun

1500
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,440
with hacking because there shouldn't be

1501
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,880
a time limit you should just kind of

1502
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,720
you just know you've tried everything

1503
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,720
you can and you had to move on really

1504
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,160
yeah yeah so you're saying that there's

1505
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,680
no pressure on bug counters um

1506
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,920
and that is true there is no time

1507
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,640
pressure but but there is also the

1508
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
pressure that

1509
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:53,839
you won't get paid if you don't put

1510
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:53,839
enough time and i guess um but yeah

1511
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:00,459
[Music]

1512
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,079
who should people be looking at

1513
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
basically

1514
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,520
um there's quite a lot i mean most of

1515
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,079
them are private that's the only problem

1516
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,920
and i have no problem telling people

1517
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,280
about companies who welcome hackers

1518
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,559
because the more people looking and

1519
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,800
hacking i guess the better

1520
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,640
the only problem is is i've been banned

1521
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,079
from a lot of platforms for running my

1522
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,359
mouth and telling people they're like no

1523
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,119
you must not tell them about this

1524
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,960
program and it's like but why

1525
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,800
i know there's a really good hacker and

1526
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,800
he would like to be able to hack on him

1527
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,240
but yeah um there's not really a go-to

1528
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,160
program to hack i mean a lot of people

1529
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,919
recommend verizon media but

1530
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,920
i submitted a bug to them and kind of

1531
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,839
left with a bit of a sour taste because

1532
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,040
they told me that yahoo cricket was in

1533
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,720
scope um

1534
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,640
so i went and looked at yahoo cricket

1535
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,959
found and found an ssrf

1536
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,799
and again that was as simple as opening

1537
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,920
yahoo cricket and there was a request

1538
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,160
made with a url

1539
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,119
you changed it to aws ip before they

1540
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,440
obviously fixed it all

1541
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,319
and you got their aws credits and things

1542
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,280
um

1543
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,160
but verizon media take a long time to

1544
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,599
kind of

1545
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,680
pay out and do stuff really um

1546
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,119
i don't know i kind of go for the

1547
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,598
companies i know

1548
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,119
and i use every day and i mean that's

1549
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,240
how i got involved with amazon

1550
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,240
and so i was the first security

1551
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,720
researcher to be recognized by amazon's

1552
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,160
retail team um so a lot of you are using

1553
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,078
amazon and you're actually secure a lot

1554
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,920
more secure now thanks to me

1555
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,720
um yeah trust me but the good thing with

1556
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,520
amazon

1557
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,520
um is they have a security at amazon.com

1558
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,599
um and they also are on hacker one

1559
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,200
hopefully they're not gonna ban me now

1560
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,920
for this for telling people

1561
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,839
but typically if you impress them enough

1562
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,680
with a bug to their i mean they have an

1563
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,960
actual security at amazon.com and they

1564
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,319
welcome reports and they'll keep you

1565
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
updated

1566
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,000
chances are if you impress them with

1567
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,000
enough they're gonna invite you to their

1568
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,400
program that's usually how it works

1569
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,920
um yeah not really i don't know how to

1570
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,640
answer that it's not a go-to thing

1571
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,079
really

1572
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:08,078
um okay any yeah sorry

1573
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,640
uh uh what about happy programs versus

1574
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,640
crowdsource

1575
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
cobalt

1576
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,759
i mean i've heard of them but i don't

1577
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,920
know too much about them really um

1578
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,440
it might work it might not i don't know

1579
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,720
do you know much about it

1580
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,760
no i i i on goal okay there's some stuff

1581
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,000
for them

1582
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,040
the advantage is you do put it in like

1583
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,680
two weeks of work

1584
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,040
okay so you get paid for your time on

1585
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,759
that you get paid regardless

1586
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,919
independently you
