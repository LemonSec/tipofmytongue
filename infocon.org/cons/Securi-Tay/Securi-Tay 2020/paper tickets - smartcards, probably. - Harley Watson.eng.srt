1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
hi everyone

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
so this afternoon i'd like to talk with

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,160
you all about story of

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,000
the current state of smart ticketing in

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,440
the united kingdom

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,198
but before i do that i want to give a

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
brief introduction about myself

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
so i currently work as a software

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
engineer for skyscanner over in glasgow

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,960
and i'm working on payment systems over

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,519
there

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,840
uh over the summer i graduated from

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,080
abertay in an ethical hacking

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,079
i probably have a really funny accent i

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,839
moved to scotland 40 years ago prior to

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,239
that lived in the dominican republic

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
and was born in california before then

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
i'm really keen

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,280
on the interaction between security and

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,879
user experience

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
i'm also really interested in embedded

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,718
devices payment technologies

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,920
and i'm really into public transit as

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
well

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,680
so this talk is essentially an overview

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
of a lot of the research that i

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
completed as part of my owner's

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,800
dissertation as well as some later work

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,519
that i've done since leaving university

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
so if you often visit major cities you

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
probably have a drawer

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,360
full of transit cards so here are a

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
handful of transit cards that i have at

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
home

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,479
from a couple of cities across north

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,720
america and europe

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
now in the late 90s the department for

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
transport in the united kingdom

39
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,759
formed this organization called itso

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
with the idea of trying to develop

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
an interoperable smart card scheme in

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,759
the united kingdom

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
so essentially back in the 90s they

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
foresaw that this is going to be a

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,759
problem

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
they figured okay different cities are

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,840
going to launch different smart card

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
schemes

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
they're not going to be compatible with

50
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
each other and it's going to end up with

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,320
people having to carry

52
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
all sorts of different smart cards

53
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
around in order to be able to travel

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,839
so they wanted to tackle this problem

55
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,000
and create a scheme that would solve it

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
before it was even a problem to begin

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
with

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
now it's so has been widely deployed for

59
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,439
quite a while now

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
the english national concessionary

61
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,398
travel scheme launched

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,719
its own cards in 2008 so

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
allowing people who are over the age of

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,798
60

65
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,079
or who are disabled to access

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,800
free or heavily discounted bus and rail

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
public transit services additionally in

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,680
scotland

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
there's a similar scheme available again

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,800
for disabled people and folk over 60

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,599
and at the moment there is a discount

72
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,080
for people between the ages of 16 and 18

73
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,079
although next year bus travel will be

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
made free for everyone under the age of

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
19 through the same scheme

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
additionally the department for transit

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,119
for transport have mandated that it so

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
be used

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
for any new smart card schemes launched

80
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,518
in the united kingdom and they've made

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,079
this a condition

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
as part of the rail franchise agreements

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
that are used

84
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,840
for the different train operating

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,679
companies when they are awarded

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
contracts to operate on particular

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
routes

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,480
one example of a of where it's so can

89
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
come into play

90
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,920
is with the alberta university student

91
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,839
cards so

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,679
this is what my student card looked like

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,760
when i still student here

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
and one thing that i was really

95
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,679
interested by

96
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,959
is that there's this it's so logo on the

97
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
back of the card

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,200
and i when i was first given this card

99
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
shortly after moving to scotland i was

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
immediately curious as to what this

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
implied

102
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
because it meant that my student card

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
could potentially do a lot more than

104
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,238
just let me

105
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,200
print and get books out of the library

106
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,799
as it turns out i was right um i can do

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,238
the aforementioned two functions with

108
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
the university there are a bunch of

109
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,959
different features that the council

110
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
in dundee facilitate through the use of

111
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
the smart card as well

112
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
and i can also side load uh various

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,679
different travel products onto

114
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
the smart card as well so i can put bus

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
tickets on it

116
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,680
um i can put um bus tickets that are

117
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
valid across all of dundee and east fife

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
on it

119
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,159
uh and i could also load on glasgow

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
subway pass you go credit

121
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
um and this is something that i was

122
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
really excited about when i first moved

123
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
to the uk

124
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
uh four years ago just the fact that i

125
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
could take my student card

126
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,920
issued in dundee go to glasgow put it in

127
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,599
a ticket machine

128
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,119
immediately put money on and just be

129
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,280
ready to travel i wouldn't need

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
any more cards i could just use this one

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
card and then essentially

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
i'd hopefully be able to travel across

133
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,440
the whole of the uk

134
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,800
now at the end of uh december 2016

135
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
uh all of the itself cards based on my

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
fair classic

137
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
which is what my student card was based

138
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,799
on expired

139
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
and this meant that i was no longer able

140
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
to travel using my student card

141
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
and i was kind of stuck in that i had

142
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,198
about 10 quid left on the card

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,440
which i no longer had access to so i

144
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,240
went to spt who managed the subway in

145
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
glasgow

146
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,600
and they weren't super enthused that i

147
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,240
had been using my student card

148
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
um to access the subway um they offered

149
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
to transfer the balance over to scot

150
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
railcard which is one of their supported

151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,719
cards

152
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,919
but sort of really discouraged me from

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
trying to use

154
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,240
any other it's so card that they hadn't

155
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
officially agreed to have be supported

156
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
right

157
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
um which sort of seems contrary to the

158
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
whole purpose of the specification right

159
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
it's

160
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
supposed to be interoperable you should

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
be able to just mix and match cards

162
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
but you know okay this is at the

163
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
beginning of 2017 so

164
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
you know it's been a few years since

165
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
then hopefully things have changed

166
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,880
and indeed uh back in november transport

167
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,919
scotland launched a campaign

168
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
to motivate people to consider smart

169
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,039
travel

170
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
instead of using regular paper tickets

171
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
and the like and they make this point

172
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
that you can

173
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,400
pick smart card any smart card right so

174
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
hopefully this means that the situation

175
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,679
has gotten better in scotland right

176
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,919
so okay fine i went over to

177
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
and who was the organization that i

178
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,799
originally sort of had

179
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
issues with and the frequently asked

180
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
question says okay well you can use your

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
your subway smart card on a variety of

182
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
different bus

183
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
operators but you should check with each

184
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,320
of them to see

185
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,319
if they'll accept it um so i did

186
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
and i went and checked that with all of

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,560
the operators that are issuing

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,159
smart cards in scotland and as it turns

189
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
out it's a mess

190
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
um there are a lot of

191
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
tickets that are issued by different

192
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
companies that they will only load on

193
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,039
their own smart cards

194
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
sometimes you can cross-load tickets

195
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,080
onto

196
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
different companies smart cards in some

197
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
cases for

198
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,560
example if you have a student if you

199
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,919
have one of the advertised student cards

200
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
and you want to put

201
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,120
explorer dundee bus tickets onto it you

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
have to take your card

203
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,440
to their office and they have to

204
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,318
activate it with their system

205
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,680
so you can't just go on a bus and use it

206
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
there are some circumstances where

207
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
different

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
issuers have different types of cards so

209
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,520
scottrail offer both

210
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
um anonymous cards and they offer cards

211
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,919
that have your photo on them and

212
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
depending on that

213
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,198
you're restricted on what kinds of

214
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,719
tickets you can use

215
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,199
um but this is very far from having any

216
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
sort of

217
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
integrated transport right the fact that

218
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,239
you you even have a table that looks

219
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,799
like this

220
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
um is just way beyond the scope of what

221
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,039
your sort of average

222
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,479
public transit user would care to try

223
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,719
and figure out

224
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
so what this means is that in practice i

225
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
now just have a drawer

226
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,919
for uk smart cards right um

227
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,599
now admittedly i probably have a lot

228
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,159
more smart cars than the average person

229
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
does

230
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
like given that this was something that

231
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,680
i was explicitly researching

232
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
but even if you're just someone that's

233
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
going within scotland

234
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,719
you're still probably going to need

235
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,159
multiple smart cards to use across

236
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,039
different cities

237
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,639
but okay let's take a step back um

238
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,400
how is this supposed to work to begin

239
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,039
with right we can see that that's sort

240
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,039
of

241
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
20 years on after the specification has

242
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,840
been developed things haven't really

243
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
gone to plan

244
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,638
um and as an ethical hacking student i

245
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,879
was really curious to understand

246
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,800
is this actually secure what is the

247
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
security mechanism that's built into the

248
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
specification

249
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,280
that allows arbitrary public transit

250
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
operators to

251
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,039
write to different cards and still have

252
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
confidence that their products aren't

253
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,840
going to be tampered with

254
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,599
so as it turns out given that it's so

255
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,400
was commissioned by the department for

256
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,878
transport

257
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,638
you can actually go and freely download

258
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
the core it's a specification from their

259
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,440
website

260
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
you can define the pdfs online you don't

261
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
even have to give them your email

262
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
address or anything like that it's just

263
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,440
a one-click download there are

264
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
12 parts to the it so specification

265
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
of course they start numbering them at

266
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
zero and these cover

267
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
all sorts of things ranging from how to

268
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,840
speak with different smart cards

269
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
how to encode data on smart cards what

270
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
kinds of products are supported

271
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,240
uh across the scheme how the back office

272
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,559
system should work how they should

273
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
communicate with each other

274
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,199
but it's so it's quite broad in in the

275
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,240
scope that it covers in terms

276
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,360
of how to set up this

277
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
unified environment and the core

278
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
principle behind it so

279
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
is that you should be able to have

280
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
different products existing

281
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
on the same smart card without

282
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,120
prescribing a particular underlying

283
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,719
technology

284
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,480
i think my student card is a really good

285
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
example of this where

286
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
the specification is flexible enough

287
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,120
where the university were able to

288
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
continue using smart cards for student

289
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
cards

290
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,800
but just being able to add on this

291
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,640
additional transit functionality and

292
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,719
this is really neat because it means

293
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
that the underlying nfc chipsets that

294
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
are used by different issuers

295
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
and even within different generations of

296
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,480
smart cards within the same issuer

297
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,959
do vary quite a bit so for instance spd

298
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,360
in glasgow for the glasgow subway issue

299
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,719
both my fair ultralight as well as

300
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,440
a sort of it's so proprietary smart card

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
scheme

302
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,920
um but in addition to that there are a

303
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
ton of different deskfire

304
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,439
cards being used out in the wild as well

305
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
and the way that

306
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,080
the specification manages to accomplish

307
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
this is by defining a three-layer model

308
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
that separates

309
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
how products are defined on the card the

310
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
shell on the card which

311
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
is essentially the equivalent of having

312
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,480
a folder on your computer that stores

313
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
everything on the card

314
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,120
and then you have the actual card layer

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
so that that's the actual underlying nfc

316
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
chipset involved

317
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,439
and this has been designed so that from

318
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,519
the bottom most layer the product layer

319
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
things can be kept fairly generic

320
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
products aren't

321
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
uh formatted differently for different

322
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
chipsets and then

323
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,480
at the shell layer that's where sort of

324
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,640
the compatibility measures come in

325
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
to normalize things between different

326
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,519
chipsets

327
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,279
so within an it's a smart card

328
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
everything is encoded inside of a data

329
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,120
group

330
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
um and what what this does is you have a

331
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,880
header at the top

332
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
uh which is your label you have the data

333
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
set which is all the actual information

334
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
that you want to have inside of that

335
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,079
packet

336
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
and then you have an instance identifier

337
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,719
which is a unique identifier for

338
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
that data group on the card and you have

339
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,920
a seal

340
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
which is it says mechanism for

341
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
preventing tampering and i'll get back

342
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,399
to that

343
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
in a little bit later data groups all

344
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
come together to

345
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
form a directory within the card shell

346
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,199
so essentially

347
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
the the way that this works is that the

348
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
data groups are all present

349
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
on different parts of the smart card and

350
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,279
your directory

351
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
contains the labels for each of these

352
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
which tell

353
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
a device that's reading your smart card

354
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
where to find these products on the

355
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,199
smart card

356
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,000
and then combining the information from

357
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
the directory

358
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
you can go and look up um the various

359
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,640
smart products

360
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,000
and get an idea of what's on the card um

361
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,480
additionally it so has this log format

362
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,160
which

363
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,160
allows for things like journey histories

364
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
or for transaction histories on

365
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,079
pay-as-you-go wallets

366
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,959
so it's sort of similar concept in that

367
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
you have

368
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:53,518
um various log entries which

369
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
are defined as orphan it's so product

370
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
entities and that they're not directly

371
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
added to

372
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
the card directory but instead they're

373
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
referenced

374
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,000
by um a product's log and then you can

375
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
go from the product and look up each of

376
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
the

377
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
the orphan products to determine what's

378
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,279
happened uh with that

379
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,638
so as i said these would be things like

380
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,959
when you top up your card

381
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,800
that would be a log entry uh when you

382
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
tap in at a station that would be a log

383
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,079
entry as well

384
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,719
and because it so has to be compatible

385
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,638
with all these different chipsets they

386
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
very quickly realize that they could not

387
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
simply rely

388
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,680
on the chipset level security so

389
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
all nfc cards provide at least some

390
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
basic

391
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,480
mechanism for access control so be it

392
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,680
having to present a key in order to read

393
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,920
or write information

394
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,719
to the card all the way through to doing

395
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,360
actual

396
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
cryptographic operations on the card in

397
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
order to prove authenticity

398
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
but because this varies quite a bit um

399
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
it so decided to

400
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
implement their own cryptographic

401
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,480
signature mechanism for all of the

402
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
information that's stored on the card

403
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
so that they wouldn't have to rely on

404
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,279
that

405
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,120
the problem is that the signatures that

406
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
are stored on the card cannot be

407
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,079
verified

408
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
without access to an it's so secure

409
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,120
application module

410
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,239
so also known as the isam so the isam

411
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,800
is is essentially um just another smart

412
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
card

413
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,000
that's located inside every single

414
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,959
ticket vending machine

415
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,399
every ticket barrier and ideally the

416
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
handheld readers used

417
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,920
by train conductors to validate whether

418
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,399
the tickets on

419
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,479
your smart card are valid or not the

420
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,480
problem with the isam though

421
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,839
is it's something that within the ito

422
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,120
specification holds

423
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,920
a lot of power this is the same module

424
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,079
that's used

425
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,439
to generate these signatures as well as

426
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,519
verify them

427
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,959
now the insole specification does

428
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
provide mechanisms for

429
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
restricting the impact that a stolen

430
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
isam would have

431
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,199
so for instance an isam can only emit a

432
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
certain number of season tickets before

433
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,760
it has to be centrally reset

434
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,720
um but despite this they're still great

435
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,880
incentive for

436
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
public transit operators to have as few

437
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
of these as possible

438
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,600
in the wild just because of how risky it

439
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
is if one of these are stolen

440
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
so with that in mind there's this

441
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
extension to the specification

442
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,040
called a remote point of service

443
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,920
terminals and the idea is that

444
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
instead of needing physical access to

445
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,719
the isam

446
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,959
at the point of validation you put your

447
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
isam inside of a data center somewhere

448
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
and then you connect to it over the

449
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
internet and you ask it to perform the

450
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
validation for you

451
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
and then you just write that over to the

452
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,920
card um

453
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,519
a more practical example of where this

454
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,959
is used and where you

455
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
might have actually seen this as a

456
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,239
consumer is the concept of remote ticket

457
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,199
download

458
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
so a lot of public transit companies

459
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,719
that use

460
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,680
smart cards have started allowing uh

461
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
passengers

462
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,079
to load tickets onto their smart cards

463
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,160
without having to go to a station first

464
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,120
um by allowing tickets to be loaded

465
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,880
through

466
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,079
smartphone apps so this is an example of

467
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,360
the scottrail app

468
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,800
so i tap my smart card to the card

469
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
it says there are no updates currently

470
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,160
available for the card and that just

471
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
shows me information about what's on the

472
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,319
card

473
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,399
but if i had purchased a ticket

474
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,199
beforehand this would go through

475
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,760
and actually load that onto the smart

476
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,160
card

477
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
um and this is secured because what

478
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,480
what's happening is that your phone is

479
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
just

480
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,079
acting as a vessel for the remote isam

481
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,600
to speak with the smart card with so

482
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,439
your phone isn't actually

483
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
very involved in the process most of the

484
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,519
heavy lifting is happening

485
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,600
on the server away in a data center

486
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,399
somewhere

487
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,759
so unfortunately the isam operation is

488
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
literally the only

489
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,360
part of the it's a specification that's

490
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
covered by nda

491
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,560
um and given that the the whole reason

492
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,639
for a lot of my research is that a lot

493
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,479
of this stuff isn't public to begin with

494
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,360
or at least the impacts of it aren't

495
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
public

496
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,160
i wasn't interested in signing an nda

497
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,279
and still to this day have not

498
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,319
signed an nda with it so so this in mind

499
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,519
i have no idea how the isam works very

500
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,320
few people do

501
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,399
even if you're willing to sign an nda um

502
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
you sort of have to have a justification

503
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,839
for

504
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
needing that information um but

505
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
despite that there are still a lot of

506
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
other sections in this specification

507
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,800
that we do have access to

508
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,519
and while we don't have access to the

509
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,839
detailed operation of the actual isam

510
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,000
we do have access to information about

511
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,880
how all the surrounding services around

512
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
the isam

513
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
speak with it what kind of data they

514
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,680
send to it what kind of data they

515
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,320
expect back so

516
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
one of the core principles within itso

517
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,880
is

518
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,560
that they need

519
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,279
various different public transit

520
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,439
operators to be able to read and write

521
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,639
from smart cards that were not issued by

522
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,240
them so

523
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
the way that the specification tries to

524
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,160
handle this while still keeping write

525
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,000
access secured

526
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,199
is by using a key

527
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,959
derivation algorithm to generate keys

528
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
that are unique for each smart card

529
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,959
based on a secret algorithm that's

530
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,839
stored on the ice app

531
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,600
so this means that as long as you as a

532
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,480
public transit operator have access to

533
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,678
an isam

534
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,079
you can then get right access to

535
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
all the sectors on a card by deriving

536
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,399
the keys for it

537
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,438
but the problem is that you need

538
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
information

539
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,480
from to begin with in order to derive

540
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,240
these keys

541
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,919
in particular the iso specification

542
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,679
requires that you have access to

543
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,600
format version code the key strategy

544
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,760
code and the key set version code

545
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,719
all of which are stored on the card

546
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,520
itself

547
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,039
so this creates a kind of catch 22 where

548
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,039
in order to

549
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,720
derive the encryption keys for the card

550
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
so you can communicate with the card

551
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
and read and write information from the

552
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,360
card you need to have already read

553
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
information

554
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
from the card to know that initial

555
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
information right

556
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,678
so the itso specification doesn't try to

557
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,399
do anything clever with this

558
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
um they just outright say okay that's

559
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,039
fine

560
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,120
uh and they compromise on giving

561
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,360
everyone read access to

562
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,559
all of the information located on it's

563
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,039
so smart cards

564
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
so this means that you can read out all

565
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,840
the information on a given smart card

566
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,879
using a key that is generic to all the

567
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,639
smart cards that

568
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
are based on that particular chipset

569
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,400
type and these keys are either

570
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,520
published on the itzo website or are

571
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,520
fairly easy to determine on your own

572
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,200
um as a hobbyist that's brilliant

573
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
because it means that it's really easy

574
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
for me to go in and understand what

575
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,360
data's on

576
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
my card so despite its relatively open

577
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,959
nature

578
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,240
um when i began this project and still

579
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
to the best of my knowledge

580
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,760
there are no open source implementations

581
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,678
of any tooling

582
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,039
to interact with a smart card i mean

583
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,640
sure there are apps on the play store

584
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,520
that let you read information off your

585
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
smart card

586
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
but those are all closed source so as a

587
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
hobbyist that's not really interesting

588
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
to me

589
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,399
so i went ahead and wrote one so

590
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,480
using the publicly available

591
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,679
documentation i wrote python tooling for

592
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
the card data

593
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,039
that's available on github the code is

594
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
terrible don't look at it

595
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,280
too closely yet it was literally written

596
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
for a uni project so there are no unit

597
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,600
tests

598
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,320
um but it's licensed under the gpl so

599
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
everyone is free to use it um as long as

600
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
you

601
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,639
um but there it's gpl

602
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,159
to prevent sort of commercial entities

603
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,919
from just taking it and and

604
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
making changes to it and keeping those

605
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,720
closed source

606
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,120
so uh pi travel card provides

607
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
an extremely basic uh command line

608
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,639
interface

609
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
um so in this case uh it's located in

610
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
nfc reader on my computer

611
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,799
and then it's just going through and

612
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,240
dumping some basic information about

613
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,320
my smart card but that that's just sort

614
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,080
of a sort of high level understanding to

615
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,000
to get an idea of whether this is

616
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,039
working what's more interesting with pi

617
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,679
travel card

618
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,679
is the underlying api that's provided

619
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,799
for hobbyist developers to build their

620
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,080
own tooling

621
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,720
um to interact with smart cards so

622
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,520
this is the python script which goes

623
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,880
through

624
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,760
and at the very top i'm

625
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,280
opening an nfc session and grabbing the

626
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,960
card data

627
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
after that i'm going through all the

628
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,440
products found on the card

629
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,360
and i'm looking for a store travel

630
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
rights product so that's what's used to

631
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,479
store

632
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,879
pay as you go balances on a smart card

633
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,200
then i'm looking to see if that product

634
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
belongs to the glasgow subway and then

635
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,080
if it does

636
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,320
i'll go through and print out

637
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,840
information about that

638
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,000
so there's just all sorts of information

639
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,080
that pi travelcard tries to return

640
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
about information that's located on a

641
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
smart card

642
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,200
um so in addition to giving you its own

643
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,000
interpretation about what information is

644
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
on the card

645
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
you still get access to the raw byte

646
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,959
streams for each of the individual data

647
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,120
groups on the card

648
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
so as a researcher it makes it a lot

649
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
easier to understand

650
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,240
the relationship between what are the

651
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
bytes on the card and what those bytes

652
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,600
actually mean

653
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,840
so now i'm going to take a moment to do

654
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,840
a live demo

655
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,200
okay so um

656
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,360
at the moment uh i just have a smart

657
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
card reader attached to my computer uh

658
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,799
unfortunately it's on the left hand side

659
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,559
uh sort of because of the hdmi

660
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,679
positioning so it's a bit hard to see as

661
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,840
an audience member

662
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,720
but here i don't have any smart cards

663
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
attached to it

664
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
now i'm going to take my trusty scott

665
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,039
rail smart card

666
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,918
put it on top of the reader

667
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,760
and i get information about my last two

668
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,480
taps on the glasgow subway

669
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,400
so that's me tapping in uh at a station

670
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,960
and tapping out in a station

671
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,840
and the total transaction cost was four

672
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
pounds 15.

673
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,439
so once i had that tooling i was really

674
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,360
curious to start

675
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,520
thinking about okay what can i start

676
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,320
doing uh with these smart parts right

677
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,360
so uh as i mentioned my student card was

678
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,000
originally issued

679
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,559
using the myfur classic chipset which

680
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
has

681
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,639
plenty of very well-known and very

682
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,679
public vulnerabilities for it

683
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,840
which essentially allow you to take

684
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,200
control of the entire card by being able

685
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,639
to derive

686
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,559
all the encryption keys that it uses

687
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,720
so using these vulnerabilities i was

688
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,080
able to clone my student card

689
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,120
uh onto just a blank nfc card

690
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,480
so um over on the left saying uh

691
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,479
unknown my fare possibly clone

692
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,320
but on the right this is a publicly

693
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
available it's a smart card checker

694
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,158
and it's still happy that my my card

695
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
looks fine it seems valid

696
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
um but sort of as i mentioned this card

697
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,600
did expire at the end of 2016

698
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,120
um which kind of sucks um because it'd

699
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,039
be neat if i could keep using that card

700
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,479
right um

701
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,320
now the problem is that tampered cards

702
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
cannot be checked offline without

703
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
physical access to an isam

704
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
so i went ahead and changed the expiry

705
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
date i changed the card number

706
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
but it still thinks that the card is

707
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,678
valid because the app just doesn't know

708
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
any better

709
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
and it can't know any better because of

710
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,760
how the specification is written

711
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,199
there's just no way for it to be able to

712
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
determine whether the card has

713
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
actually been tampered with um

714
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,280
unfortunately

715
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,400
i will not be demoing this because i

716
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,918
would really rather not get deported

717
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,919
so please don't ask me how i did that

718
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,640
the information on how to do it is

719
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,080
fairly publicly available anyway

720
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,919
but this is really a problem when uh

721
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
trained conductors for for a certain

722
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,000
local train operating company

723
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,918
often use their corporate phones which

724
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,120
don't have access to an isam

725
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,799
for ticket validation additionally when

726
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,399
you're traveling on some of the routes

727
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,158
operated by the strain company

728
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
there's often a lack of mobile data

729
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
service available so

730
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,120
it's not really feasible for them to

731
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,918
make use of

732
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,559
this remote isam functionality anyway

733
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,799
because

734
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,399
there's just not enough there's not good

735
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
enough mobile data infrastructure

736
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
available

737
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,360
for them to be going online to validate

738
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,678
each of the tickets

739
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,039
and this is this is just a really good

740
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,440
example of where

741
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,039
requiring specialized equipment in order

742
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,600
to do ticket validation

743
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
just leads to ticket validation either

744
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,360
not happening

745
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,960
where i might like wave my smart card at

746
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,678
an instructor and they'll just go cheers

747
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,360
pal

748
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,960
um or they'll half validate it in that

749
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
they'll see what information is on the

750
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,640
card but not actually be able to tell if

751
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,720
that's genuine or not

752
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
and this is this is part of the problem

753
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,880
with losing an isam

754
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,440
being an incredibly risky proposition

755
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
for a public transit operator

756
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
that so specification says that if you

757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,719
have an isam

758
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,039
in some sort of device that's going to

759
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,320
be moving around it has to be really

760
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,240
heavily secured

761
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,240
you can't be able to extract it from the

762
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,279
device without

763
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,679
needing a tool to open it up um

764
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,760
and so as i was saying like operators

765
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,799
are directly incentivized to deploy

766
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,120
as few isam's as they can get away with

767
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,879
while it's still a crucial component to

768
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,000
validating the integrity

769
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,000
of any smart ticket issued on the it's

770
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,400
so scheme

771
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and further than this i sort of think

772
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,200
that it's those directionless

773
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,520
flexibility

774
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
really gives public transit operators an

775
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
excuse

776
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
to be lazy with their smart card

777
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,480
deployments

778
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,480
it is really easy to just lift and shift

779
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
your existing paper ticket products

780
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
onto smart ticketing products without

781
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,679
considering

782
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
all of the other possibilities that are

783
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
facilitated by using a smart card to

784
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,279
begin with

785
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
and a really good example of this is

786
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,600
this document

787
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
published by the rail development group

788
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,199
who at the time was known at the

789
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,039
association of train operating companies

790
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
where they've essentially gone through

791
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,120
every single paper ticket that exists

792
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
within national rail

793
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,879
and they've tried to map it to the ito

794
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,959
specification

795
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,919
um and in some cases they just haven't

796
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,840
managed a few years ago scott rail tried

797
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,159
doing advanced single tickets that is

798
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,720
tickets which are restricted to

799
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,600
one particular train at a particular day

800
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,400
and time

801
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,199
uh on it's so smart cards and they just

802
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,919
couldn't manage to actually encode

803
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,279
what time the ticket was valid for so

804
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,520
you could buy a ticket

805
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,559
for a train which is way cheaper and

806
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
then just travel on

807
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,399
any other train because the conductor

808
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,640
has no idea which train your ticket is

809
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,679
actually valid for

810
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,279
um so i mean the sort of question is

811
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,279
like if not it's so

812
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,919
then what um i think in an ideal world

813
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,760
we'd discontinue these weird drm

814
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,440
encumbered m tickets that some train

815
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,840
operating companies provide

816
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,720
um and switch to just unrestricted

817
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,039
e-tickets

818
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
um which other train operating companies

819
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
provide which lets you just print them

820
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
out on ticket stock

821
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,120
on regular computer paper or just be

822
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,559
displayed on a mobile phone without

823
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,479
downloading an app

824
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,480
um and it'd be great to see more train

825
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,960
operating companies use these

826
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
e-tickets for advanced single so scott

827
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,240
rail for example have still been

828
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,279
dragging their feet on supporting

829
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
e-tickets at

830
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,640
all because they're still trying really

831
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,760
hard

832
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,600
to push for their smart card scheme

833
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,879
additionally it would be really great to

834
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,520
see

835
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,279
fixed origin destination stored tickets

836
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,840
on its own so things like

837
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,399
singles returns or car nets uh just be

838
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,240
discontinued in favor of simplified

839
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,678
zone based ticketing but even better

840
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,520
than that would be something

841
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
like an account based pay-as-you-go

842
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,679
scheme because

843
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,720
the whole thing with smart cards is the

844
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,799
computer knows

845
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,080
where you've gone you're tapping in

846
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
you're tapping out

847
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
and the computer is a lot better than

848
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,320
you are at figuring out which

849
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,080
which ticket is the best value for any

850
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,158
given travel that you're doing

851
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,678
there's no reason why i as a consumer at

852
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,480
the beginning of the day should have to

853
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
decide

854
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
whether a single a return or even a weak

855
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,240
ticket is going to be the best

856
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,679
value for my travel when the computer

857
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,279
should just be able to figure that out

858
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,960
for me

859
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
and i think a really good example of

860
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,039
this is some of the work that transport

861
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
for london have done in this industry

862
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,320
um and when transport for london

863
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,320
launched uh

864
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,158
sort of started beginning uh their

865
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,120
investigations into smart ticketing

866
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,640
technology

867
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,479
they were forced to innovate and that

868
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,200
there was nothing else available at the

869
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,080
time

870
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,279
and the very early nfc technologies that

871
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,600
were available

872
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,000
were extremely limited in terms of how

873
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,760
much storage space they had available

874
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
so it would have been completely

875
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,679
impractical

876
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,279
for transport for london to ask people

877
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,039
to pre-load

878
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:02,799
a single ticket journey on their

879
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:07,039
smart cards before travel every time um

880
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,520
so sort of go through these um in 2003

881
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,240
oyster launch just for season tickets as

882
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,840
i said

883
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,760
because of this restriction with space

884
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,879
on the card season tickets are way

885
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,080
simpler you're loading

886
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,520
one on for months at a time um

887
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,918
the next year they introduced pay as you

888
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,639
go journeys for both buses and rail

889
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,080
uh the year after that they introduced

890
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
automatic daily price

891
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,480
capping so this meant that um as a

892
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,960
passenger on tfl services

893
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
you could just ride all day and if it

894
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,399
turns out that it would have been

895
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,000
cheaper for you to buy a day ticket

896
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,760
the system just goes okay i'm going to

897
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,320
pretend you bought a day ticket and it

898
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
caps

899
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
your usage at the price of a day ticket

900
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,200
but likewise

901
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,520
if your journey if you're traveling

902
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,799
uh doesn't meet the price of a date

903
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,399
ticket then that's fine

904
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,080
you're not wasting any money because

905
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,879
you're still only going to spend

906
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,720
up to that point 2010 they rolled out

907
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,720
oyster pay as you go to all national

908
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,600
rail services within the capital

909
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,640
um in 2012 they were the first public

910
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,918
transit operator

911
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,360
in the world to accept contactless bank

912
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,399
payment cards

913
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,199
for use on their services and today they

914
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,678
now process

915
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,559
one in 10 of all uk contactless

916
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,840
transactions

917
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,720
and they're one of the largest

918
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,399
contactless merchants in europe

919
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,080
in 2016 they then licensed that

920
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,799
technology to cubic transportation

921
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,158
systems

922
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,399
who are rolling it out quite

923
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,440
successfully in various different cities

924
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,639
across the world

925
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,559
um so sydney recently launched um their

926
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,840
contactless travel scheme based on

927
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,120
tfl's technology a few months ago and

928
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,320
new york are currently

929
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,760
in early trials for their

930
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,559
contactless base scheme as well and

931
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,840
i think the really interesting thing is

932
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,639
oyster kicked off

933
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,760
in 1991. now if we think back to the

934
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
first slide that's

935
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,720
seven years before it so even started

936
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
and yet throughout all of oysters

937
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,399
history

938
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,678
oyster has never been and still is not

939
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,959
an it's so smart card

940
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,919
it has always been its own smart card

941
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,320
that uses its own proprietary backend

942
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,080
system

943
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
and i think the sort of crux of this

944
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,799
problem is computers allow us to just

945
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,360
scale

946
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,399
problems that we'd otherwise make better

947
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,399
solutions for

948
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,000
because it's way easier to just throw

949
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,239
brute force at the problem

950
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,320
than it is to actually sit down think

951
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,159
about it and try and come up with better

952
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,639
solutions

953
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,000
and with that in mind i think it's time

954
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
that we stop asking

955
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,159
how do we migrate paper tickets to smart

956
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,559
cards and we start asking

957
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,600
how can we leverage the unique benefits

958
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,120
that smart ticketing provides

959
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,480
before i close off there are a handful

960
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,518
of people on the screen that i want to

961
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,840
thank throughout

962
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,000
this research i spent about a year of my

963
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
life conducting this research

964
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,279
and i definitely wouldn't have been able

965
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,080
to manage it without everyone listed

966
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,840
here

967
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,840
that mind thank you for listening

968
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,678
uh so we have a lot of time for

969
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,679
questions

970
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,320
uh so if anyone has anything they'd like

971
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,760
to ask

972
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,600
i'd be happy to answer as best as i can

973
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:29,840
uh sure sam in the back

974
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:29,840
do you think um

975
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,329
[Music]

976
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,579
[Music]

977
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,240
[Music]

978
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,000
sure so uh for those of them here the

979
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
question was given the state of

980
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,799
the the fractured privatization of

981
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
britain's railways

982
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,200
what would the feasibility of a unified

983
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,640
standard to combine all of these

984
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,399
be and i think this is why transport for

985
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,240
london is also a really interesting

986
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,840
example because they're the only place

987
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
in the uk where they've actually managed

988
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,639
to do this

989
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,559
but it's also because transport for

990
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,919
london are the only organization that's

991
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,080
actually been willing

992
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,840
to step up and handle fair settling on

993
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,720
behalf of all of the different transport

994
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
companies

995
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,640
the entire point of it so is that it's

996
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
decentralized so nobody has to handle

997
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,120
fair settling for different transit

998
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,439
providers

999
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,279
but this also means that if i have pay

1000
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,679
as you go balance on my card for glasgow

1001
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,000
subway i can't then go and use that

1002
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,600
on um like the time and where metro

1003
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
they're just not compatible they don't

1004
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,360
touch each other

1005
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,159
and i think unless the uk government

1006
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,559
steps in

1007
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,360
and starts facilitating that fair

1008
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,760
settling

1009
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,039
we're just not going to see a unified

1010
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,039
smart card scheme

1011
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,799
the likes of ov chip cart in the

1012
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,320
netherlands where there's just one smart

1013
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,080
card that works across

1014
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,720
all public transit in the company in the

1015
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,320
country using one pay-as-you-go balance

1016
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,919
and so in practice i think what's

1017
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,000
probably going to happen is

1018
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,600
the uk government's unlikely to step in

1019
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
in that role and instead we're just

1020
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,078
going to see more of a shift toward

1021
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,599
contactless payments

1022
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,480
where the banks are acting as fair

1023
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,480
settlers instead

1024
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:22,719
anything else

1025
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,639
all right brilliant well you just have

1026
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,040
an extra 20 minutes before lunch

1027
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,240
um but i really appreciate all of you

1028
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,159
giving me your time today

1029
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:34,158
thank you
