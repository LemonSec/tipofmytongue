1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,039
hello

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,559
uh i'm going to talk about effective

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
deals attack tracking

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,320
uh my name is lloyd's and i'm gonna say

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840

really good conference so far

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
um so yeah over the past like two years

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,840
i've been working on a platform called

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
denture which is

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,080
basically a kind of

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,480
ti and kind of so basically testers like

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,719
uh

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
the ulster intelligence platform and

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
i'll be working on

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,559
like my spare time so again

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,559
so here are my i'm live labs on food

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,839
uh i'm third year maker um i'm a reverse

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
engineering business and

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,760
i love windows internals um i like to

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,760
program a lot

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,359
yeah mainly i've seen more programmer as

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,359
well uh like do ctfs as well

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
so yeah soccer front end so like dancer

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
is basically yeah this is one anime

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
that's really bad

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,839
savage you know kind of like math and

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,159
like stuff inside and yeah

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
so yeah what does that need this type so

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
in denser we have like

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
we have the categorized dls factions

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,798
like three basic things so

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,560
attack on resources basically like

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
attacker for example right

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
uh renting like three servers i mean

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
like oh i'm going to like attack this

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
guy and then there's refresh reflection

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,920
attacks and volume

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,479
so attackers like seek to disrupt um

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,640
their target so the motivations of

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
basically like the majority of those

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
attacks are basically kids wanting to

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
like

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,399
annoy other kids but there's also big

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,798
players there as well for example

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
uh the owners of the services that the

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,040
kids basically

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,439
rent from um

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,360
have a like big progress as well say

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,919
like go overload service like in

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,039
like a major amount of like data which

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,038
basically the shops are service and

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,399
yeah like the basic uh

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
yeah like the attacks will span through

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
the entire osi model so

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
you can have layer four attacks and

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,720
marvin also employs player three attacks

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
as well

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
so the thing is who's heard of my

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,879
writing audience

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,720
right uh so my basically

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
traditionally uh beatles attacks

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
targeted player four and layer seven

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
so the player four levels like tcp and

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
udp

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,799
and layer seven which they is

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
traditionally saw and their seven

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
attacks

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
went for the kind of like so for example

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,680
http

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,680
uh we see attackers attacking https like

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,959
cyber for example and uh

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,079
the mri kind of changed the game a bit

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
and yeah the market first gigantic yeah

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
so the reflection attacks are the

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,840
biggest type of attacks because

78
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,840
basically goodbye foreign

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,079
like four like four pounds like cheaper

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,079
enough

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
to basically like take care of everyone

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,560
offline for like and they can hit them

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,839
like five gigabit per second

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,480
which could take probably a small

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
like enterprise offline nothing major

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,200
though obviously like

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
perfect attack if it wasn't like a home

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,079
connection something like the obviously

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
and yeah like the market is gigantic for

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
these guys

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
um this guy like uh people got arrested

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
recently

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
um who actually owned a lot of these

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,319
services and

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,238
he made like 250 carriers on

96
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,238
yeah i don't know why i work in security

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,798
set what is the market like so as i said

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
the barrier for entry is extremely

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
for four dollars you've got once you're

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,120
like a massive attack well not a massive

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,239
attack but

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,439
you you could take like a small

103
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,799
enterprise offline you could take a home

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,680
connection thing

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,879
um yeah the big boys not against us for

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
example like

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,079
traditional bonuses with email set and

108
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
trick ball et cetera but not

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
like well they do engagement but they

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,680
don't because the return for infection

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,239
for the russian guys or like

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,478
they want to go after the banks for etc

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,478
and

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
yeah because they want to go after all

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,120
this stuff like potential effects and

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
web injects and stuff like that so this

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,479
is an example of here

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
about feedlots for higher service uh i

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,440
put a sim strategy until

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,599
and uh you can register

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
email passwords and then buying into one

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,040
of your one offline

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,359
um people who access this are gamers

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
uh sure a few people in the audience

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
have probably stressed services in the

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
past

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
uh yeah they just feel like extremely

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
popular

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,599
but i've just been getting recent

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,120
takeouts and stuff so

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
yeah so like russians are not good uh

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
this is a screenshot from exploding

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,758
which is like a russian cyberpunk form

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,080
uh which is private

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,639
and that's a a more uh sample called

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,639
smokebot

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,159
a feature but they did not care about

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
the awesome power because as i said

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
return infection especially in windows

140
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,799
box is not

141
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,719
ideal um they make a lot more food like

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,440
potential bets and

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
similar banking details et cetera so

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
yeah

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
the big guys do not care about us about

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
uh the guys who are like obsessed with

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
like

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,120
the you know stuff remaining like kids

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,440
so see as i said like one of the major

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
uh the biggest better deals taxes of

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,960
reflection tax

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,680
so for example if you send off 39

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,719
by packet so like a dns resolver it's

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,479
going to send you back

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,199
like 3k vibes um

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,318
and if you switch the source id in the

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
header

158
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,319
and a lot of isps actually block this so

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,840
the threat actors need to find

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
a provider that does not block like

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
splitting ip addresses

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
so if you find a provider that can so

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,360
basically like ask people filter

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,560
the source header and make sure the ip

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
address and source editor is actually

166
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,039
from their network so it's not from the

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
right

168
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,800
neighbor if they'll just block it so the

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,080
threads go after networks which

170
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
don't block it and they'll pay a premium

171
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,440
price for that in the black market

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,359
um so yeah

173
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,000
the threat that we're seeing inside yeah

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,039
vulnerable services

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,960
such as dns and it will send a tiny dns

176
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
period and i'll return a massive dns

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
period

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
so udp obviously is like connectionists

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
like you send a response come back to

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,080
you

181
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,239
and yeah you'll get a response much

182
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,960
larger

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
and obviously if you send a request

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,799
we'll be ups like responses right so

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
that's not responsive but if you send

186
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
the request the crdns are

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
like 8.8.8 and you get a

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
it's like 39 bytes for quite a hybrid

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
result and you get a response it's like

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,720
3.3 gigabytes

191
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
that's a massive response and if you can

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,360
script the ib address

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,400
and then they return like a mass amount

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,599
of data

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,440
you can exploit that so then

196
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,039
if an attacker for example scans

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,160
internet for all the vulnerable dns

198
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,560
services

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,720
filters by the biggest packet size and

200
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,599
so and then it goes by the biggest

201
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,880
packet size

202
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
they can then exploit that so if there's

203
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,759
hackers switch side p drives it will

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
come back to the victim the one group

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,120
it will obviously root by the attacker

206
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,479
it'll come back to the victim so that's

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
when it becomes like a massive issue

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
yeah so that's a kind of example of what

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,359
happens

210
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
uh imagine there's like a kind of

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
internet route

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
it's like those three flights address

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
they won't also come back to them and

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
then

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
there's so many servers like if you're

216
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,879
so glad there's a massive amount of data

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,318
and the buyer currently as i said is

218
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
extremely low for these guys

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
and it's mainly like kids like 13 year

220
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,479
olds

221
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
because they killed each other before

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
and everything showed up

223
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,799
yeah yeah it's like we can spot a

224
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,319
modular vector so

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,440
ts3 man cache dns mtp ldap tftp

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
anything that basically returns

227
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
something bigger

228
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,520
so tsp reflection is a thing but it's

229
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
not as big as udp perfection because

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
everything's like um reflection is a lot

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
more

232
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,479
like the returns a lot better for the

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,478
attacker so

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
teamspeak for example if you send i

235
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
think it's a initial packet

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
so i'll start with i think the

237
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,640
application rate is like

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,240
23 or something so if an attacker

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
switched our victim's ip address and

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
went

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,279
oh this is my p address um give this to

242
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
me it's not actually our address they

243
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,480
just set in the header

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
they'll come back to the victim so what

245
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
attackers will do we'll scan the entire

246
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,279
internet for these vulnerable servers

247
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,120
and see oh like that's uh

248
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
that's returning like a lot of items

249
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,839
let's let's take a look

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
at like a list and let's use that to

251
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
tackle though

252
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,599
i guess it's like common service like

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
ntp like that's using like everyone's

254
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
phones like

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,399
for time and health apps like throughout

256
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,360
yourself and tftp's

257
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,320
directv and sap like they're all common

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
protocols

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
these protocols were made like decades

260
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,120
ago or from minecraft minecraft

261
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
it's not ancient but

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,079
protocol now protocols nowadays

263
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,000
implement uh like proper handshakes like

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,720
tokens and stuff so you'll send a bite

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
sorry using a packet someone would go oh

266
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,040
here's a response or a challenge for

267
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,319
example

268
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
it's like this type of stuff can't

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,360
happen but stuff like dns like

270
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,519
that's like embedded quite hard to

271
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,519
change

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
yeah it's like ddos space botnets like

273
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,519
mri for example

274
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
uh iot devices slightly they're really

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
really really easy to compromise and the

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,279
return on infection is like really bad

277
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,279
uh apart from obviously the network

278
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,800
usage which we'll actually use for

279
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,600
um yeah like the computer power for ifes

280
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
are like

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
i think devices are like extremely small

282
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,360
it's like

283
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
yeah like attackers can't really use

284
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,079
them for much and they're using other

285
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
more

286
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,319
and more campaigns such as like tripod

287
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
and stuff as a proxies for actual

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
seaters

289
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
but yeah iot devices in general are

290
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,800
useless to attackers

291
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
um yeah apart from just for the network

292
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
usage

293
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,040
so that's where that's used a lot is

294
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,439
sorry that's why they're used a lot by

295
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,719
like

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,160
for others so yeah yeah when those

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
machines are not used at all as i said

298
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,519
earlier because

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
yeah the return on infection like would

300
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,279
they rather steal their good banking

301
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
banking potentials or would they rather

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,360
deal someone in like

303
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 the network for like a good hour or

304
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,720
whatever

305
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
or am i starting like a potential death

306
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,360
yeah so mario was like responsible for

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,439
like some of the biggest evil attacks

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
like you've seen recent times so i

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
and sort of getting what's happening

310
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,760
that's what it helped us hit mri

311
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,760
uh time dns was set by mri which took

312
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,880
square off by

313
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,399
some amazon services as well and some

314
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,680
facebook services as well um

315
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
yeah the source code was leaked by the

316
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,319
offer in 2016 which is actually turned

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,560
out to be a 22 year old guy from uh

318
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,240
massachusetts called harvester um

319
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,040
and they actually both worked at a

320
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
anti-delos company which is really weird

321
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,319
so basically what they were doing was

322
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
they're attacking minecraft servers

323
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,320
with this massive like massive bonnet

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
and saying to them oh we're attacking

325
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,360
you guys you need protection

326
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,839
but also minecraft server owners didn't

327
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
know like

328
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,000
they're like on the bad side they're

329
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,680
like oh these guys are attacking we've

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,279
seen you guys attacking them

331
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,279
oh fire protection so

332
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:59,120
yeah yeah it was leaking in 2016

333
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,560
by a guy under the name of anna senpai

334
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,920
which is a anime reference uh for gaming

335
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,518
anime fans yeah so like

336
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
yeah you linked that so basically

337
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,160
through behind the delete was he wanted

338
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,000
distribute like the

339
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,360
kind of responsibility over the board

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,040
um you kind of want like every like skit

341
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
on earth to use tomorrow

342
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
kind of like distribute the plane

343
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,399
basically so like it can be attributed

344
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
back to him

345
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,480
it really backfired on them um

346
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,760
yeah it's like so recently yeah so

347
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
it probably gets through the natural

348
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
brute force in brutality um

349
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
because i do advice they're like

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
they're man like i

351
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
did but like the square is so bad and

352
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
the recent because they all use like oem

353
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,319
stuffs like

354
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,079
there's like factors like china and

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,000
they'll basically just push the firmware

356
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,359
and they'll just brand it on like

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,519
multiple rifters like if one

358
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
has an issue like 10 brands have an

359
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
issue

360
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
so all these youtubers are basically

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
using like default passwords for like

362
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
everything

363
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
and mario it's kind of hard to put it's

364
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,319
um like lists of username and passwords

365
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
so they could i think other

366
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,000
hundred thousand people like spread

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,399
globally as well

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,240
so yeah coming back to the details and

369
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,000
as a people with like udb

370
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,600
tcp and h3 attacks um

371
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,279
and they can like bypass protection so

372
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
i'll just pipe players up

373
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
and they basically emulate it's like

374
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
being like a real person on a browser

375
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
within the bot it's like yeah like the

376
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
hard code is

377
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,680
basically pretending to be a person

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
personal website so they could bypass

379
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,359
pipeline

380
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
um yeah they target multiple

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
architectures

382
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,959
and they spread like for example like it

383
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
could be like arm it could be missed it

384
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,839
could be

385
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,000
so it could be risk like it could be

386
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
anything

387
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,279
so basically what they do is when they

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
load in onto the device we'll

389
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
go for everything so they're like trying

390
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,599
loads like x86

391
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
x64 mips arm

392
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,839
um yeah

393
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,519
yeah and that's the guy there who

394
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
actually created mine he was taken to

395
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
court

396
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
uh two years ago

397
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,279
um he actually lost his own university

398
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,719
using mine which got him caught and they

399
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,920
he started posting about his roommate

400
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,760
and his roommate grasping

401
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,079
at grassland yeah yeah he works with fbi

402
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
now so

403
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,399
yes this is kind of the life cycle of

404
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
like ammar i bought

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
so this initial compromise which is from

406
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,439
another box because obviously it's like

407
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,439
a self-spreading type thing

408
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,800
so the device will compromise off right

409
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
after scanning

410
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,160
for example on a server or by another

411
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,000
bot

412
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,680
and then the bot will connect and see

413
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
the um

414
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,959
it will start scanning itself for other

415
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,000
vulnerable devices on the internet

416
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
and then i'll try and exploit them and

417
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
mars like

418
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
has developed recently because i'll say

419
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,199
it's open source so like a lot of like

420
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
kids that have jumped on it

421
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
and they're trying to like employ

422
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,719
exploits and said first like

423
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,800
they've moved away from the traditional

424
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,560
brute forcing site it's more

425
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,839
like exploiting like uh vulnerabilities

426
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
and like the british firmware

427
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,680
well the device is firmware in general

428
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,479
if that's the server

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,439
iot device yeah it'll try and mode

430
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
itself

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
uh it doesn't really matter what

432
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,839
architecture is like there's so many

433
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,319
architectures so basically what they do

434
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,440
is

435
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,199
write like a back script and uh they'll

436
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,800
basically load the other bind they

437
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,880
don't comply with sorry the cross

438
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
compile a binary for every single

439
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,279
architecture that exists i'm just trying

440
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,160
to just spam it and be like oh

441
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,079
yeah just load it like and then yeah the

442
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,279
device is infected

443
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,920
and then obviously that's part of it and

444
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,600
then iot devices traditionally running

445
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
like a

446
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
like flash memory so it's not actually

447
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
on like a disk as such

448
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
so as soon as like someone rebricks her

449
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
router like it won't be on the device

450
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,479
anymore

451
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,359
obviously it will still be very both

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
getting text again

453
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,639
yeah it's like there's so many parts of

454
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,199
mario as i said like you got the guy

455
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
like

456
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800
basically said to everyone like oh

457
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,279
here's he goes see how like people make

458
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,719
like

459
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,680
stupid names like gucci and corona and

460
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,600
effort and stuff like that yeah it's

461
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,079
like most people who use this are like

462
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,680
in the age of like 15 to 23 which is fun

463
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,519
uh yeah like the ncaa the ncaa have good

464
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,199
stories about guys who have

465
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
talked about this because of our french

466
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,920
as i said the bar for entry this is solo

467
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,720
all you there is let you it's open

468
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
source it just

469
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,759
 like like download the source

470
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
stuff your seated bang you've got a

471
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,839
botnet easy

472
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,600
uh yeah like those guys have employed

473
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
other exploits as well

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
so there's been a few like old days

475
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,399
we've been but

476
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
there's actors behind these actors that

477
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,600
have sold them all days

478
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,959
sorry two days uh

479
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,360
the sun zero days uh because basically

480
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,359
so people behind these uh kind of

481
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,639
forksmart i get paid a lot more by other

482
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,240
guys

483
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,000
uh they're more invested in kind of like

484
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
finding clients who will actually pay

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
for

486
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,120
details for our servers whereas as i

487
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
said earlier the reflective stuff

488
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
the guys like buying like the public

489
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
online services are not kind of involved

490
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,198
in these circles

491
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
so these circles are kind of close and

492
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,919
like it's like all about who you know

493
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,959
and

494
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
yeah yeah i'm like

495
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
why why would you care about slash

496
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
anyways yeah so like for example like

497
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
one point three terabytes per second

498
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,000
it's like those games and github

499
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,520
and that was using mencast um

500
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,039
some news articles uh

501
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
yeah like you could bring an entire

502
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
organization for these doesn't matter

503
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
like ebr

504
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,559
solution you have doesn't matter what

505
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
mdr so that you have it doesn't matter

506
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,799
like how good it's like

507
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
you're like yeah it doesn't matter if

508
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,400
you can take an

509
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,679
organization down for a diesel sorry for

510
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,960
adidas attack

511
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
but they're screwed like it doesn't

512
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
matter like if they don't have

513
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,880
protection

514
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,480
like yeah and it's

515
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
as i said like the barrier for entry is

516
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,440
extremely low

517
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960
it's like you don't need to compromise

518
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
anyone's like disrupt them like all you

519
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,400
do is buy a four dollar

520
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,880
service from online and smack that id

521
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
you know what i mean

522
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,960
yeah yes like how is like what my

523
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,240
friends are like how do we track them

524
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
like how do you see what these like

525
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
miscreants are actually doing is bad to

526
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
get these bad kids

527
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
yeah so your reflection attaches to

528
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
three businesses as i said like they

529
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,960
actually scan

530
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,320
threat for vulnerable devices it's like

531
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
what are we actually acting as a

532
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
vulnerable device

533
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,879
and pretended very vulnerable

534
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,639
i would say the only issue with this is

535
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
about the gray area because technically

536
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,120
you are attacking victims

537
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,400
but yeah with the answer i did put stuff

538
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,000
in place so like

539
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
they're not like constantly attacking

540
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
people or attacking people

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
i'll send them birth to comments like

542
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,960
we're vulnerable service to

543
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,639
i'm not patch anything and we're seeing

544
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,559
victims being attacked

545
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
so like we can see who the victim is so

546
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,360
we can basically parse the

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,720
destination ip um in the ip header

548
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,559
and be like oh um and we can identify

549
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
so basically what these guys do who run

550
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,879
these services will they'll scan the

551
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,600
internet like

552
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,160
probably every week for for example like

553
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,840
dns

554
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
servers uh like reply like a massive

555
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
amount

556
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,559
as i said earlier um 39 bytes uh

557
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,240
compared to like

558
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,000
30 3k votes um

559
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,000
yeah and then we can pretend to be

560
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
wonderful services let me contract them

561
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,039
so back to my oh god that's

562
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
yeah so like what about my how do you

563
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,479
monitor this activity

564
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,160
where's my chicken mom because i'll say

565
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,679
it's malware and it's loaded up to like

566
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
different devices and stuff

567
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,520
there's a few routes we can actually

568
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,360
take to monitor them

569
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,000
so my take on this i don't know

570
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,240
if it's the best way so we need to

571
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
collect the samples first

572
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,280
so we can like run honey pots for

573
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,919
example like harvey

574
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,000
is a commonly really easy to use like

575
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,280
helmet honeybot

576
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,799
and denser runs on like a custom h if

577
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
you honey up on like emulates routers as

578
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,480
well

579
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,919
and then it's a vulnerable device um

580
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
because yeah as i said like actors are

581
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,320
like they're actually moving away from

582
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
the brute forcing side of things and

583
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
going towards the more exploitation side

584
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,000
of things

585
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,480
and trying to target the firmware inside

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,360
so yeah my take was basically pretend

587
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
you're infected

588
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,199
so that we can monitor what they're

589
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
doing and

590
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,760
at this earlier it's a bit like area

591
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,320
when it comes to law because technically

592
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,919
you are so yeah i wrote this like you

593
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,918
don't actually engage in attacks but you

594
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,080
can see what they're doing

595
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,120
so the first part is like to collect the

596
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,000
sample so you can

597
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,719
extract the c2 um so the extraction part

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
is actually

599
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,240
the hardest part because mario actually

600
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
flies off the station like every single

601
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,120
level

602
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,879
like you can't just run strings on like

603
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,520
strike procedure

604
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
um yeah and then obviously the emulation

605
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,320
is like whatever you like mara's

606
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,799
protocol which is a binary based

607
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,399
protocol and

608
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,158
yeah that's when it gets logged and it

609
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
gets put into the denser which is a

610
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,559
timely intel part

611
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,879
which is a very threat

612
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,158
intelligence-based term but yeah and

613
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,480
then

614
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
um denser has like a websocket api so

615
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
organizations can just

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,400
basically kind of like pull from the apa

617
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,479
and go we saw them got attacked we saw

618
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
like they were getting attacked oh god

619
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,440
um yeah they can post my api and

620
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,400
uh yeah and we also set up alerts as

621
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
well so

622
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,360
if an organization says oh um whatever

623
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,600
whatever is that

624
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
uh

625
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
it's not free by the way it's like a

626
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,880
sales pitch

627
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
yes like the the the approach of mario

628
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,400
was the extractor seated

629
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,919
well one approach was to extract the

630
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,120
safety manually which was an issue

631
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,280
because obviously my

632
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,719
strings for example this subroutine here

633
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,360
is like one of the

634
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,280
uh decoration machines and these are all

635
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,479
the streams here which are

636
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,158
to be depressed and the guys as i said

637
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,919
like mario is open source like

638
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,400
they can change they think sorry keys

639
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,799
they can change anything in the goals

640
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,480
so or you could have a sandbox for

641
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,240
example like caper

642
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:20,640
because some it's a hybrid analysis or

643
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,000
malware or firestore for example um

644
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,440
and hosts that look like but the issue

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,240
with eyes is extremely like um

646
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,760
yeah it's a high overhead um so

647
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,720
and i have like no am i getting streams

648
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,280
i have like no money to like

649
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
kind of facilitate that stuff so yeah

650
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
the best

651
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,840
option i came up with was using unicorn

652
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,879
which is like a cpu and emulation

653
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,039
framework

654
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,720
and there's a project based off it

655
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,919
because you um use the card and

656
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,600
basically

657
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,960
i can like click the lipstick calls so

658
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,199
yeah the best option was to hook the

659
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,919
liberty balls for music horn

660
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,520
and then they should revise as well yeah

661
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,960
accomplishes a bit but

662
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,639
yeah like unicorn supports multiple

663
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,200
architectures i don't need to have like

664
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
five vms different architectures and

665
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,320
different environments

666
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
that use the corners all that's all and

667
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,559
there's no dm involved there's no

668
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
nothing at all

669
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,760
our runs are like bare metal

670
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,559
okay so back to the collection point so

671
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,559
yeah we need to collect the samples

672
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
and get the honeypot like a honeypot is

673
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,080
the best approach and curry is

674
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,120
great like the guys might carry quantity

675
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,720
updated

676
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,639
it's the best helmet and the ssh

677
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,000
honeypot is like ever existed it's

678
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,840
really good and the guys

679
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,120
the guys playing are really good as well

680
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,879
um yes for

681
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,559
what the attackers go after the firmware

682
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,600
so there's been a lot of vulnerabilities

683
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,600
which are

684
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,480
like firmware based um

685
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,080
so my approach to that was again like

686
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
pretend to be a victim

687
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,279
kind of emulate the environment so an

688
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,000
attacker would actually attack you

689
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,600
and then we love that um yeah we could

690
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
use virus though

691
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,918
but virtual enterprise a little kind of

692
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,960
use it is cost a lot of money

693
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,159
uh or yeah for example like other open

694
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,799
more shares

695
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,600
uh like fireshare rvx underground which

696
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
has

697
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,279
come back recently again if we add all

698
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
that stuff together

699
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
so we use open source kind of the shares

700
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,799
of malware and we add

701
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
the honeypot stuff i'll say make sure

702
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,320
there's no difference

703
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
and we have like a really good data set

704
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
because we'll see what's like going live

705
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,760
what other people have seen

706
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,640
because attackers like so i try to make

707
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,720
dancers so

708
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,679
it's like distrib distributed like

709
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
really well

710
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,679
uh because attackers are sometimes only

711
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,480
target china or japan or

712
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,360
whatever so yeah we can add those all

713
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
those together and get a really good

714
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
deal sir

715
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,399
oh sorry about two minutes

716
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,840
oh two minutes yeah yeah the extraction

717
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,520
stuff yeah as i said you yeah use the

718
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,039
coin then you emulate it as i said

719
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
tomorrow is actually open source so we

720
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,480
can emulate the

721
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,200
postcard um you can log the attacks as

722
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,799
well i'm

723
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
simply pretending we're the victim

724
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,639
basically here um yeah

725
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
and yeah the timeline part is that the

726
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
attack was our pipeline elastic

727
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,600
which all goes into tensor and

728
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,918
organizations be like oh

729
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,918
i'm too like i'm attacked so this acen

730
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,120
is this asm's attack through

731
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
see like uh attacking like

732
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,678
patterns for example like if they're

733
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
going to attack like every wednesday by

734
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,360
certain threats or whatever

735
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,279
yeah so like what have i seen with this

736
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,320
like the usa is the most attack country

737
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,039
yes there's so many vulnerable dns

738
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,279
servers it was

739
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,799
certainly like if you give them

740
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,279
like a tiny pocket like they'll just

741
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,320
like

742
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,840
bang their way out of you and yeah like

743
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,399
the mario opera is called they're big

744
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,520
targets

745
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
like they don't go after like your

746
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,760
traditional like 12 year old who's like

747
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,678
kill someone else like call of duty or

748
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,000
whatever um

749
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:51,120
yes like any questions that's material

750
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,120
that's my book
