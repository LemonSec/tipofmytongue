1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,640
um

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,919
so normally as you guys know i'm a

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,719
member of the beer farmers

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,678
um and normally our talks are tons of

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,440
fun

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,800
and um we do all sorts of fun things

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,759
uh to support the community um so

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
um basically right now um i'm not in

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
hacker mode

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,759
and i'm not really gonna be in corporate

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,439
douchebag mode either

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,439
i'm just gonna be kind of like telling

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
it like it is on this subject

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,680
um just a few things quickly about me

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
i'm pretty active on twitter i think

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
a lot of you follow me um if you're in

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
information security

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
i highly recommend your you go on

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,680
twitter um it is a good resource

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
and um you know if you follow the beer

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,039
farmers uh we got your back

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,039
if you run into a troll problem um

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
i've been involved in information

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
security since defcon 9

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
which for those of you i believe it was

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,440
defcon 27

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,199
this year um so i've been around for a

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,120
while and i've seen a lot of things and

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
i like to say i was in the room when the

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,679
commercial internet

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,679
gave birth which is kind of true because

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
i remember dial up and all of that

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,880
silliness

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,320
and so you know i've evolved um

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,759
into you know corporate mode where i now

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,158
i write a lot of emails

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,960
i patiently wait for progress on on

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
issues

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
i comment a lot in forbes and online and

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
i'm a ciso and i work for the beer

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,520
farmers

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
um so a couple of observations i want to

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
share with you guys before i get into

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,199
the meat of this presentation

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
which is really about my feelings about

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
global climate change

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,079
and i t and i t systems all right which

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
i realize is kind of a a pretty broad

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,759
topic

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
and there's tons of hypocrisy in this as

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,040
well

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
okay um and that's something that you

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
know

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,759
i'm i'm dealing with but i'm also trying

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
to rationalize it right

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
it's sort of like if you spend all your

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
time flying around the globe talking

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
about global climate change

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,919
are you really helping the situation

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
right

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
um so we have an image problem in

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
information security it should come

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,640
as no um no no thing we've got

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,480
hacky scare scary hacker which is me by

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,958
the way if you can't tell

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,399
we have carl von klauswitz who knows who

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,120
klaus woods was

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
big big time prussian general yeah and

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
then we've got

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,200
uh son to zoo uh for a couple of reasons

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,440
one it's mandatory to have a son to zoo

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
reference in a information security uh

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,359
presentation

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,000
but also he's a 15th century or 13th

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
15th century

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
chinese warlord so this is a problem

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
because when you start rolling out all

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
the military and again

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,359
first hypocritical thing i'm ex-military

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
but when you

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
start rolling out all the military

82
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,120
jargon

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
in cyber security you lose a lot of

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
people that haven't been in that

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,760
environment

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,840
okay so um i tend to try and use

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,518
in my presentations role models like

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,120
alan right

89
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,000
and um ada lovelace and hayden lamar

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,720
who without haiti lamar i wouldn't hate

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,319
my bluetooth rigs on a daily basis when

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,359
they cut out on a conference call for no

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,079
reason whatsoever

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
right but to be honest we have some

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
great role models

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
and what i'm what i'm really asking you

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
to do is when you

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
start doing presentations and stuff like

99
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
that think about

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
a more positive message and some of

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
these role models

102
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
as i try to get this to work again yeah

103
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
um

104
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
to use in your presentations and to use

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
as mentors come on in folks i'm just

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
starting the preamble you haven't missed

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,680
any of the good stuff

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
clearly there was a train issue which i

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,720
i will use this joke

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,440
okay so i've been on a lot of um

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,799
recent kind of like interviews and

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
articles about

113
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,680
national critical infrastructure right

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,159
especially transportation okay and

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,959
so they're all concerned about cyber

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
attacks right

117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
on the train system i'm just gonna say

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
the train system in the uk is already

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
messed up

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
okay and i said the major threat from my

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
analysis

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
about national critical infrastructure

123
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,760
when it comes to train

124
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,079
is some dude with a leaf blower can shut

125
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
down the entire train system of the uk

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,160
with leaves on tracks

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
okay so you know let's keep this in

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
perspective because sometimes we just

129
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
get too much on the

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
on the uh on the hype machine so what's

131
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,239
sy jacks

132
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
um well sy jax is uh rowan's new um

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
ghost writing opportunity for our blog

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,520
hey rowan right on dude

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,520
appreciate that but um we do

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,198
cyber threat intelligence and i'm not

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,799
going to sit here and educate you on

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
cyber threat intelligence because

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
i'm actually teaching a course on it in

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,840
manchester um

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,239
at comptia on the 4th so i'm pretty

142
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,400
excited about that but you know we do

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
threat intelligence and

144
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,638
speaking of threat intelligence we can

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
see that there is a threat here

146
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,800
right it's a bit it's a large amount of

147
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,840
water and i i do want to congratulate

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
the guy that

149
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
designed this data center or lady that

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
designed this

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
data center that actually is containing

152
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,400
what could be described as a small

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
uh wading pool where unfortunately the

154
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
servers are located

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,679
so i've been thinking about this since

156
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
about 2015.

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
i wrote an article it might even still

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
be out there

159
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,880
and it starts off with cape spear in

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
newfoundland and

161
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
i was in newfoundland for a conference

162
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
and

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,039
it struck me at that point that

164
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
our planet is becoming more hostile to

165
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,039
human life

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,840
but it's also becoming more hostile to

167
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560
it

168
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,520
to silicon and i want to explore that a

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
little bit

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,880
um we have a precarious relationship

171
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,199
i'm i i think anyone here

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,680
that lives in wales right now that had

173
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,039
servers in their basement

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,479
is feeling the effects of this type of

175
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,159
scenario and it's really gonna

176
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,639
again this is not a good news

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
presentation it i hope by the end of it

178
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
you're not just like oh i'm going to the

179
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,159
bar and i'm just going to drink because

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
there's

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,759
nothing that we can do about this there

182
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
are a lot of things because

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
like basically i turned 50 years old and

184
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
i went

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
i now have an opportunity to take my

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
knowledge and turn it into wisdom

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,800
okay and i need to impart to you that

188
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,199
next generation

189
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
that um there are some issues that

190
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
you're gonna face

191
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,039
in design in uh resiliency

192
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
in career and all those type of things

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,318
that are all going to be

194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
that global climate change is going to

195
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,880
be transformational so

196
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
we we've got some truths here that that

197
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,599
we can talk about

198
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
that are not particularly good so

199
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,520
the first is we're trying to get to a

200
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,120
two degree

201
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,359
below two degree centigrade as a goal

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
and if you look back in the historical

203
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,319
research on global climate change

204
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,520
two degrees was like a catastrophic

205
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
level of global

206
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
climate change this was back in the

207
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,400
research in the 90s

208
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
so we've we've set our goal to just be

209
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,758
majorly screwed up as opposed to like

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
armageddon

211
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,880
okay but the problem is is that four

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
degrees

213
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
we were literally hundreds of feet

214
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
higher we have

215
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,960
a historical record that shows where sea

216
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,000
level had been over time

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
and my hometown of winnipeg manitoba

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
canada

219
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,719
and it'll factor into this in a little

220
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,400
bit but it was

221
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,759
under water of an inland sea called

222
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,560
lake agassi which then drained off

223
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,120
and became uh lake winnipeg and lake

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,199
manitoba which are the remnants of that

225
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,400
okay so my entire city about

226
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,680
i think it's 45 million years ago was

227
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,080
under water so something to keep in mind

228
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,800
and then we had this which is the really

229
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,878
not good news things

230
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,160
252 million years ago um

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,199
the planet warmed by five degrees now

232
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,599
that released a whole bunch of methane

233
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
that is seven times more destructive to

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,840
the environment

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,199
uh than carbon dioxide okay so we're

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,039
already seeing this i don't know if you

237
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,039
caught this discovery show

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,199
where they went to some lakes in the

239
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,000
north i think it was in alaska

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
and they they found some bubbles trapped

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,159
in the ice and they cut those bubbles

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
um opened like open them up with a

243
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,240
chisel and were able to set

244
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,159
fire to the bubble okay so that

245
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
tells me that we're releasing a bunch of

246
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,880
methane gas

247
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,880
so these are not cheery topics um and

248
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,920
they're important to start talking about

249
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
because

250
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
from what i've seen no one is talking

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
about this

252
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,199
issue and that's why my sort of 2020

253
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,240
series is going to be on this so

254
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,560
we have storms we're getting hit with

255
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,560
more active weather and i i'm not a

256
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,959
meteorologist or a climatologist but

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,599
i'll

258
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,880
describe a little bit on why we have

259
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
these problems and where they're going

260
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,720
to affect us

261
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,800
we have fires everybody can hear i think

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399
is in consensus with the fact that

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,800
fires are bad um we have

264
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
floods as the poor people in wales and

265
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
yorkshire and all over the world are

266
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
experiencing

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
which may lead to a global i.t system

268
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,399
collapse

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
which could in fact be an economic

270
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
collapse so we're going to go through a

271
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
bunch of things

272
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,920
a lot of this is in a book called the

273
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,920
uninhabitable earth

274
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,279
i highly recommend you read it not

275
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,560
before bed

276
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,600
because you'll have nightmares okay um

277
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,880
and then of course

278
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,120
uh stormy daniels get it stormy

279
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
because it goes into this slide there we

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,680
go okay

281
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,440
stormy storms so there's

282
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,279
monetary amounts of money attached to

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,079
when a catastrophic hurricane or typhoon

284
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
hits a country and there's a couple of

285
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,519
things i want to talk about this

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,640
um from a cyber security perspective

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,320
we see two major attack

288
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,720
surfaces here disinformation is one

289
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,880
right and criminal profiteering from

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,240
phishing emails is the second

291
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,920
post event cleanup okay so

292
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
from a cyber threat intelligence

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,399
perspective anytime there's a big storm

294
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,239
anytime there's catastrophic damage we

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,079
pretty much know the mode that cyber

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,760
criminals go into

297
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,800
but from our perspective of major storms

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,040
who here in the uk has had a storm day

299
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,359
where basically the rail system shut

300
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,079
down you had to work from home

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,839
raise your hands yeah okay so if there's

302
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,199
going to be more frequent storms what

303
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
does that tell you about

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,279
the workplace and the workplace dynamics

305
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,839
that you're you're going to have

306
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
right not to mention the reliability

307
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
level of the trains and airplanes in

308
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
this particular country

309
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
right there's going to be more working

310
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,880
from home so there's going to be

311
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
more requirements from an i.t

312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,279
perspective to do that

313
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,760
securely and stably right

314
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,040
um i've been recently watching a lot of

315
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,480
people melting down

316
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,760
on twitter over adobe light storm

317
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,000
and um their cloud-based offering which

318
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,839
apparently when you're generating like

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,560
4k videos it's kind of difficult to do

320
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
without

321
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
you know the bandwidth of gchq to

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
process

323
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,079
so we're going to see stuff like that

324
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,439
and we're seeing a lot

325
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,760
of damage um from this

326
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,360
and here's a really interesting thing

327
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
from this storm

328
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,560
that 7.5 million people went without

329
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,200
power okay that's got a huge economic

330
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
impact

331
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
i mean if you can't power anything

332
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
you're going to be

333
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,360
in real trouble and the other factor

334
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
here was in new york and new jersey

335
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
storm

336
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,399
storm surges were about 14 feet above

337
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,279
average low tide

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,760
okay so what does that really mean it

339
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,560
means

340
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
all of that critical infrastructure from

341
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,399
transformers

342
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,160
and um the dmarc points for like your

343
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,120
dsl connections

344
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,399
and your infrastructure related to it

345
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,760
services

346
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,079
gets basically turned off right

347
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
because of water and we'll talk a little

348
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,519
bit about how destructive water is

349
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
um in a bit but the other issue here is

350
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
that

351
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
this all takes a lot of time and effort

352
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,000
to put back together

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
after it gets wet okay and in fact what

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
we're seeing

355
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,200
is salt water is very corrosive so in a

356
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,000
lot of cases when you get these storm

357
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
surges

358
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,399
it leaves a bunch of salt water which

359
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,040
corrodes rapidly

360
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,560
right into infrastructure requiring all

361
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,599
of its replacement

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
right it's so bad that it can sometimes

363
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
take

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
weeks or months to get some of these

365
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
large transformers

366
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,719
back in operation because we just don't

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,359
have them

368
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,000
stocked away right we have to either

369
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,880
build them

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
and transport them or clean them and get

371
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
parts

372
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,279
we have this whole ecosystem and i'll

373
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,560
talk a little bit about that

374
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,160
so there's been a lot of talk about

375
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,959
innovative solutions which i think this

376
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
one

377
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,119
was the one that i was really kind of

378
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,959
taken aback from

379
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,839
okay uh the fact that they think

380
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,040
for 250 billion and 500 billion we can

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,639
just like

382
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,839
damn the north sea okay and so

383
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,560
as the atlantic ocean rises

384
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
the north sea is gonna stay the same

385
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,279
okay

386
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,560
now can anybody see what a problem that

387
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
would be

388
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,040
i mean it's great if you're living on

389
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,959
the south side of the uk

390
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,560
right facing towards france and germany

391
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,319
but maybe not so great on the other side

392
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:14,479
okay so again i i don't want to i don't

393
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,600
want you as taxpayers as consumers

394
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,120
to take this kind of i'm going to say

395
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,240
bunk and suggest that yes this is the

396
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,279
solution for

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,120
global climate change and sea rise is by

398
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,320
building a giant dike

399
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,399
for only one piece of ocean in the

400
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,560
entire ecosystem i thought this was the

401
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,600
most ridiculous thing i'd ever seen

402
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,479
okay so we have another problem

403
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,880
um the amazon we set it on fire

404
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,639
australia we set most of it on fire good

405
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
news we have you know six more

406
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,760
continents to go

407
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
so um that's all good we have another

408
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
problem though

409
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,680
and this is like so you look at that and

410
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,839
you're like

411
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,800
okay that's where i used to work from

412
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
home

413
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,680
so where do i work now the impact of

414
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
these kind of disasters is huge

415
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,079
not just from the pipes in the ground

416
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,000
issue which i'll talk about in a second

417
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,479
or the infrastructure that needs to be

418
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
replaced but we also find that in

419
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
catastrophes like this the

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,199
cell phone networks quickly get

421
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,320
overloaded and fall apart

422
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,079
like at an ariana grande concert okay

423
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
where it takes half an hour to send a

424
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,479
text message

425
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,560
so so our problems here is that

426
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
we are living in a very precarious

427
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,719
situation

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,040
where fires and wildfires can come upon

429
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,399
us

430
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,079
very very quickly and again this is now

431
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,120
from the cyber threat intelligence

432
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,040
perspective

433
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
is getting that warning out to your

434
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
employees that something bad is

435
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
happening

436
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,079
in a lot of cases these people had

437
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,199
between 30 to 45 minutes of notice

438
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,479
that's not very much okay

439
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
and and so we're finding that as global

440
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
temperatures

441
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
increases as we have these more extremes

442
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,279
and temperatures

443
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,719
our infrastructure and our builds are

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,439
not holding up

445
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,560
so as an example one of the major

446
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,839
problems that they had in the post

447
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,040
fire here was it got hot enough

448
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
to melt all of the plastic pipes in the

449
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,959
ground

450
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
when plastic when this particular abs

451
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,839
plastic

452
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,639
um melts it produces something called

453
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,759
benzene

454
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,320
and benzene is very toxic to humans

455
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
so you have in addition to this and

456
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
cleanup costs

457
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
you can't just like go in plant some

458
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,920
trees plant some grass

459
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,839
rebuild the building you literally have

460
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
to dig up all of the old crappy

461
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
infrastructure

462
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,040
okay and put it back so this is why

463
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,079
it takes a long time to get things back

464
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,719
on its feet

465
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,439
after you have a fire like this okay you

466
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,399
have environmental problems

467
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,639
so floods a little bit about floods so

468
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,160
literally this is the lobby of verizon

469
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,079
and i'm sure they got a lot of tech

470
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
support calls about their dsl not

471
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,758
working

472
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,639
okay but there are fundamental problems

473
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,640
that we're having

474
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
with this type of thing and we get us

475
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,120
government recommendations that are

476
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,280
saying oh

477
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,239
like you should put your generators on

478
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,359
the roof

479
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,839
okay you know this is all kind of well

480
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,678
and good

481
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,760
but the infrastructure that you have to

482
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,799
keep going comes in these cables and

483
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
conduits

484
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,319
in the ground so having a generator on

485
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
the roof

486
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,918
is very short-sighted because what are

487
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,400
you going to be powering

488
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,039
like nothing right so it'll all fall

489
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,799
apart

490
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,320
so this is one of the issues that we

491
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,600
have is that we need to build

492
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,799
infrastructure

493
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,840
that is resilient is capable of

494
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,600
delivering service

495
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,959
under these type of conditions and we'll

496
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
get into kind of

497
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,000
a problem and this is what miami is

498
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,679
going to look

499
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,160
like in 2030 or 2050. all right

500
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,000
now miami is an interesting little bit

501
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,880
of a problem that i'll get into a little

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
bit later

503
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,640
but as we can see this is probably not

504
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,440
good uh for the street lights um because

505
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,559
you have no street lights to see there

506
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
right

507
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
um and of course anything with a

508
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
foundation

509
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,679
is going to be in really rough shape so

510
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,559
if we look at the uk

511
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,880
a little bit we can see that clacton on

512
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,000
c becomes clocked in in c

513
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,799
okay and this is a big problem

514
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,960
and i'm i'm going to get into this why

515
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,160
this is a big problem in a second

516
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
yeah so this is the big one here

517
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,080
so this is what new york would look like

518
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,799
by about 2030 to 2050 again

519
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
and you can see um a big portion of it

520
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,440
the blue

521
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,679
is the water okay now

522
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,720
a 3.7 degree warming of the global

523
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,760
temperature

524
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,600
it's estimated would cost us over 550

525
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,600
trillion in costs right

526
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,719
now the entire global economy is about

527
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,000
225 trillion

528
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,160
so this is a problem now who here seen

529
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,520
the movie the big short

530
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,960
okay and that was about property values

531
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,840
and housing prices and

532
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
mortgages okay i'm gonna blow your mind

533
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,959
a little bit on how this

534
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,799
problem has manifested and kind of

535
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
suggest to you that we have another

536
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,000
major problem

537
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,679
so rowan can help me participate here so

538
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,039
rowan insurance organization okay

539
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,640
rowan is one of my clients i am a

540
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,320
giant insert insurance organization okay

541
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,520
and right now i have insurance policies

542
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:43,280
on all the buildings in the blue area

543
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,000
okay now let's just pick a number and

544
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,440
say

545
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,480
i have 10 billion dollars of risk

546
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
all right because i have to pay

547
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
a whole bunch of people if these

548
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,480
buildings go under water

549
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,320
all right now let's keep in mind that

550
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,600
little stat that i threw out there about

551
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,720
14 foot

552
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,879
um storm surge okay so

553
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
i say you know what i don't have 10

554
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,840
billion dollars of risk

555
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,840
so i'm going to pay rowan's insurance

556
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
company

557
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,199
25 million dollars so that

558
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,840
if these risks are realized he is going

559
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,640
to pony up

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,480
million dollars all right that's called

561
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,840
diversifying risk

562
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,720
and actually insurance companies are

563
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,639
mandated by the government to do that

564
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,280
the idea being

565
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
is that if we the risk is distributed a

566
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
bunch

567
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,600
of a whole bunch of different companies

568
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,679
right then i'm able to meet my

569
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,879
obligation to pay out the 10 billion

570
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,360
dollars

571
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,400
you with me so far well here's the

572
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,799
problem

573
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
i've sold a whole bunch of policies to a

574
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,120
whole bunch of companies and they in

575
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
turn have

576
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,959
sold a whole bunch of those policies to

577
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
a whole bunch of companies

578
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,120
the problem is is i'm going to have to

579
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,918
start paying out on these

580
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,520
but not immediately i'm going to have to

581
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,480
start paying these out as

582
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,480
some of these buildings get underwater

583
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
as some of that critical infrastructure

584
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,080
that runs

585
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,400
those buildings becomes corroded

586
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,918
polluted or has to be ripped out

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,200
so i am faced with a a small

588
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,760
dangerous dip up until the point we get

589
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,400
another giant storm that comes in

590
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,120
and does more than 10 billion because it

591
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
puts

592
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,439
half of long island underwater and at

593
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
that point

594
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
what am i gonna do i'm gonna try and get

595
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,918
a government bailout

596
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
just like the banks did when they sold

597
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
shitty mortgages

598
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,320
ultimately what are you guys gonna do

599
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,158
you're gonna pay for it

600
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,840
this is one of those things that blows

601
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,360
my mind because

602
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,639
you can see this coming right we can do

603
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,678
something about this

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,799
the you shouldn't be allowed to build

605
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,520
more stuff in areas that we know are

606
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,039
gonna get swagged by a storm or go

607
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,879
underwater okay here's another problem

608
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,919
that we have here

609
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,000
crop failure we know that the planet is

610
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,280
changing but yet we're doing the same

611
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,799
things okay a great example

612
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,840
is um the growing of rice

613
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,600
in regions like california okay and i

614
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,439
didn't know this until i started doing

615
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,439
the research but the california rice

616
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,360
crop is one of the largest in the world

617
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,600
you would have thought it was india or

618
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,158
you would have thought it was in asia

619
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
but no it's actually california now this

620
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,600
is a problem

621
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,320
because there are more humans being born

622
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,158
every day and rice is actually one of

623
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,918
the things that the majority of humans

624
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,600
out there on the planet eat

625
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,559
right so if we have crop failures

626
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,039
it has massive repercussions because

627
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,960
hungry people do angry things

628
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,400
because they're hungry in fact that's

629
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
one of the reasons when i was

630
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
actually in the military they could get

631
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,440
us to do a whole bunch of things

632
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,440
is they made us super angry all the time

633
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
and one of the ways to make people angry

634
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,840
is not to feed them

635
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,640
okay but this is an interesting stat

636
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,480
that came from my homeland

637
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,240
1.9 billion in losses in 2018 was the

638
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
fourth highest amount on record

639
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
not including uninsured costs paid by

640
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
all levels of government business and

641
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,919
individuals

642
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,039
so what is 1.9 billion

643
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,760
well think about this folks there are 35

644
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,720
million roughly people living in canada

645
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,200
so take 1.9 billion divided by 35 and

646
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,080
that's

647
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,960
just the cost of dealing with a crop

648
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
failure

649
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,039
okay so this is has a massive

650
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,840
repercussion

651
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,799
and we have a problem here too because

652
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,199
we have

653
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,760
most forty percent of the planet living

654
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,120
within a hundred kilometers of the sea

655
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,080
well fortunately here in uh uh dundee

656
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,760
you're on a hill that's good news right

657
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,439
but you're gonna lose the

658
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,279
probably that victorian albert

659
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
monstrosity that they built

660
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,520
oh well too bad uh with the

661
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,440
what is it with the 10 quid um coasters

662
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,200
right somebody was telling me about that

663
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,799
so we've got six million people

664
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,960
currently living in coastal areas

665
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,480
vulnerable to sea level rise today

666
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
and today's refugee problems are

667
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
straining political systems the syrian

668
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
crisis has created one million homeless

669
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
people

670
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,320
right um um projection for 2050 suggests

671
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,720
200 million climate refugees will move

672
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
to more

673
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,879
habitable climes unfortunately this is a

674
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,399
very

675
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,480
habitable climb all right so this is a

676
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
problem that will come to us we know

677
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
this is going to occur this is not

678
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
you know somebody looking into their

679
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,879
crystal ball going well it may happen

680
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,439
no it will happen right we're already

681
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
seeing

682
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,960
the effects of this but then we get

683
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,240
research here

684
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,159
whoops let's go back yes

685
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,080
the question really on a lot of people's

686
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,880
mind and bernie sanders said this

687
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,760
he said that syria is the first climate

688
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,880
crisis

689
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,158
uh war okay um

690
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,880
i don't think it matters to be honest

691
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
but let's let's just basically what

692
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
pisses you

693
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
off when you need something and you

694
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,760
can't get it not want

695
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,960
but if you need something and can't get

696
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,720
it now us

697
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,400
we're kind of special snowflakes when

698
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,159
amazon says it's going to deliver on

699
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,720
prime day and then it doesn't

700
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
we get pissed off okay first world

701
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,559
problems

702
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,679
okay but but this is really interesting

703
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,760
to me because

704
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,760
what they were trying to do is say that

705
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,080
the syrian crisis

706
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,039
that we currently have didn't have

707
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,678
anything to do

708
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,520
with global climate change okay but it's

709
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,840
still a freaking war

710
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,559
okay and i think that misses the point

711
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,959
that it's just going to exaggerate

712
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,080
and exacerbate the system that already

713
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
exists

714
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,000
so i'm going to go to tech for a little

715
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,640
bit okay

716
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,760
this is a picture of all the undersea

717
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
cables coming

718
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,879
in to various demarcation points and i

719
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,640
draw your attention to and i can use

720
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,720
this fancy laser

721
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,960
uh to this that was miami

722
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
so does anybody see a bit of an internet

723
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
connect connectivity problem

724
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
in the future absolutely and then when

725
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,240
you see

726
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,918
in new york and stuff like the these are

727
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,320
all the transatlantic

728
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
uh cables and stuff like that again in

729
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,360
very precarious

730
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,240
places all right so this is a problem

731
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,918
that we know

732
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
is going to come to and they're saying

733
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
the infrastructure could be underwater

734
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,400
by 2033.

735
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,520
all right and it doesn't look like this

736
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,200
is going to be like

737
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,320
even if it's 2035 and we're wrong by two

738
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,279
years that i'm going to be well probably

739
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,559
done by now

740
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,919
probably found in some cd bar and fife

741
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,799
um but you folks have got to deal with

742
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,440
this

743
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,520
right and then and this is why i'm i'm

744
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,720
out here trying to talk about this issue

745
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,200
so this is a real problem

746
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,720
a real fundamental problem so this is a

747
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
type 42 destroyer

748
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
it's uk's pride and joy they're one

749
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,080
billion dollars a pop

750
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,960
okay they don't work in really hot water

751
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
okay so this is where i'm saying if the

752
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,799
government's

753
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,559
toys to do national defense don't work

754
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,120
in super hot waters

755
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,360
in the gulf that affects the uk's

756
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,158
ability to go and kill people

757
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
so as soon as the uk has a problem and

758
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,840
can't kill people

759
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,439
we're gonna have to do something but

760
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
again rather than

761
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,440
dealing with the issue of oh my god the

762
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
water and the gulf is too hot we're

763
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,360
refitting

764
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,080
these things at taxpayers expense again

765
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,678
right to make them work in hot water so

766
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,409
we can go and kill people

767
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,960
all right yeah

768
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,440
[Music]

769
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,320
so this one is the slide that i wrote

770
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
even before

771
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,080
coronavirus hysteria hit everybody all

772
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
right

773
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,439
but i want to talk a little bit about um

774
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,320
human beings

775
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,679
and what we do when we're sick okay

776
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,240
especially with flu

777
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,000
what happens you get a temperature right

778
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
that's where your body temperature goes

779
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,480
up

780
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
all sorts of crazy happens to you

781
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
you have those fever dreams like you're

782
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
on absinthe

783
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,880
but generally your body attempts to cool

784
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
itself by

785
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,799
using its immune system to fight it off

786
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,080
what did i

787
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,918
what if i told you that if

788
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,600
you're already at 45 degrees centigrade

789
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,679
and you get a fever and your body is

790
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,760
already working really hard to keep

791
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
itself cool but now it has this

792
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,679
infection

793
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,559
what do you think happens to you

794
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,240
basically

795
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
a bunch of your friends show up and see

796
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,159
some kind words about you how you're a

797
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,559
kind person and a generous person and

798
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
stuff

799
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:03,200
you're dead all right so

800
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,399
dead is not a good state to be in

801
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,960
right nor is eating bat

802
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,158
apparently that's what patient zero was

803
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,480
for coronavirus

804
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,919
not mexican beer there's a lot of

805
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
confusion about that

806
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,960
so i just want to clear that up there if

807
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,279
you had any misconceptions

808
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,240
it has nothing to do with corona so

809
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,480
please

810
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,919
be safe out there right you can stop

811
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,600
watching kung fu movies

812
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,559
also known as a threat vector

813
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,199
right as well but my point here is is

814
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,080
that

815
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,520
these diseases that in this country are

816
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,678
unheard of

817
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,840
when you have that global climate change

818
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,399
when you have

819
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,600
moving and surviving because of mild

820
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,158
winters

821
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,439
you have major major problems on your

822
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,760
hands

823
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,279
there there's a particularly gross

824
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,120
article that i'm going to talk about i

825
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,240
didn't want to show pictures of it

826
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,840
okay but in canada we have a moose

827
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,480
problem okay the moose

828
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,000
was found to have over two ten thousand

829
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,679
wood ticks on it

830
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,960
okay super gross but the wood ticks

831
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,919
basically have thrived because a really

832
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,640
cold winter those minus 40 winters

833
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,240
haven't hit canada in a couple of years

834
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,200
enough to suppress

835
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,039
that wood kick population all right and

836
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,840
what are we doing

837
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,080
unfortunately wood ticks don't really

838
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,120
have a supernatural predator

839
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,918
in large amounts so they are absolutely

840
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,719
thriving

841
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,080
so we now have one of the majestic

842
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,880
canadian moose

843
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,240
right um riddled with these insects that

844
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,760
are busy sucking them

845
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,440
life out of them and driving them crazy

846
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,840
to the point where they're almost

847
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
committing moosicide

848
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,959
because you know sometimes they leap in

849
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
front of cars but

850
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,000
no my point being is that it's it's a

851
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,279
really

852
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,039
um precarious situation

853
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,039
i think there's another factor here that

854
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,600
i wanted to talk about as well is that

855
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,679
um we also have a problem with the

856
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,678
permafrost and i i said about the

857
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,240
release of methane gas being a problem

858
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,799
okay

859
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,440
here's another problem there might be

860
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,039
stuff

861
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,919
there okay that we haven't seen

862
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,679
in our society for a very long time so

863
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,640
as an example recently there was

864
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,159
outbreak of

865
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,919
bubonic plague in a place called siberia

866
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,000
and you're like bubonic plague

867
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,519
traditionally struck europe we had

868
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,640
1664 i think it was which is the black

869
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,519
death that

870
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,320
crossed europe um you know millions of

871
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,640
dead

872
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,279
so this is maybe my problem with the

873
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,799
current coronavirus coverage in that

874
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,960
they're treating this thing like it's

875
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,960
the plague it's not

876
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,760
right it's got about a i think the last

877
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,799
count was 2.3 percent mortality

878
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,960
rate uh chances are you're gonna die of

879
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,399
diabetes more often than you're gonna

880
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,000
die of coronavirus

881
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,399
okay so so think about that but

882
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
one of the problems is is that we pretty

883
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,199
much are done

884
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,559
when we get to 54 degrees celsius

885
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,360
at 54 degrees a healthy elder adult male

886
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,879
or female

887
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,799
person biologically cannot keep itself

888
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,000
cool enough so if you're caught out in

889
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,399
the heat

890
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,799
you're pretty much going to be cooked

891
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,080
our critical infrastructure

892
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,039
mostly made up of cat5 cable right cat5

893
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,240
cable

894
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,559
75 degrees centigrade is when it melts

895
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,600
and we've started to see temperatures in

896
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,519
vehicles

897
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,760
right and inside areas with no airflow

898
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,760
approaching that mark so what does that

899
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,679
mean it means that if you painted a

900
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,640
pedestal black and put it

901
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,720
out there somewhere in like afghanistan

902
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,279
it would get to a daytime temperature

903
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,760
exceeding 75 degrees and all the cabling

904
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,600
inside would melt into one gooey mass

905
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,879
all right so another thing to think

906
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,039
about we're in this

907
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,519
era right now oops did we lose uh

908
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,519
connection

909
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,439
i think the data projector might have

910
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,600
shut off

911
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
anyways i will not i only have a couple

912
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,559
more slides

913
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,200
um so this is where i'm saying

914
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,840
that we need to look at this is an

915
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,919
organizational risk to the businesses

916
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,399
that you're going to um start working

917
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,679
for and you have to think about

918
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,518
how can you um wrap your mind around

919
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
some of these challenges in terms of

920
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,000
like remote working

921
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,439
in terms of like building infrastructure

922
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,080
where to build it

923
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,200
how to build it so that it has some

924
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,519
resiliency

925
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,279
and stuff like that there's a broad

926
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,640
range of concerns here

927
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,200
right even just notifying your employees

928
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,080
of a particular situation related to a

929
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,360
weather event

930
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,799
for instance right um nobody should be

931
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,158
caught by surprise i think also like

932
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,639
when you go into planning

933
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
oops okay it's coming up um we just have

934
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,720
to contact them

935
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,799
fortunately i have them right there oh

936
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,480
yay okay perfect oops

937
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,560
oh it's now what is it

938
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,240
misbehaving is it my slides maybe no

939
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
it's the other one

940
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,959
check the input

941
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,399
oh okay yeah so this is

942
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,119
this is what i'm sort of saying is that

943
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,638
you can have

944
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,200
non-hysterical conversations about these

945
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,599
issues

946
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,040
okay and you can start putting it into

947
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,079
planning documents

948
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,719
right resiliency for hydro let's not

949
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,599
build it on you know in a flood plain in

950
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,560
the basement

951
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,040
right basic stuff right let's have a

952
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,679
plan

953
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,480
for when the actual internet cables

954
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,359
don't work

955
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,000
can we go with 5g hotspots are there

956
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,000
things that you

957
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,760
can do right how are you going to get to

958
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
your people when mertz

959
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,839
got hit this was really interesting from

960
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,040
the not petya wannacry

961
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,560
when mertz got hit um

962
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,720
they turned to whatsapp because they had

963
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
single sign-on enabled for majority of

964
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,919
their applications and no one could get

965
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
onto their system because they got

966
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,400
ransomware

967
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,280
so they had a plan to use whatsapp um

968
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,560
to continue communications right the

969
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
other thing that

970
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
saved their bots is they had a data

971
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,720
center

972
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,960
they had a domain controller in africa

973
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,279
and what happened was they were running

974
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,839
a flat network when they got infected

975
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,359
the ransomware hit all of their um

976
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
infrastructure and active directory

977
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,560
controllers

978
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,400
except the one in africa because guess

979
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,040
what it was down

980
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,599
it was on a saturated link so the atmos

981
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,599
the

982
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,440
ransomware didn't get to it so quite

983
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
literally they got super lucky in

984
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
rebuilding their infrastructure

985
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,400
so one of the simplest things that you

986
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,078
can do for your business

987
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,400
is perhaps to create a uh data a

988
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,200
sorry an active directory server let it

989
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,359
replicate

990
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,439
and then turn it off for five days bring

991
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,040
it back up let it replicate again and

992
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,440
turn it off for five days

993
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
so that if you do get ransomware or god

994
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,160
forbid

995
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
a pipe burst and fills your basement

996
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,118
where your server is

997
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
you at least have your active directory

998
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,880
to get everybody back underway

999
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,560
so there's one more peril that we'll

1000
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,680
talk about and then i'm gonna

1001
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,320
release you guys to the hounds um

1002
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,000
it's this so mother nature is the

1003
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,160
ultimate malicious actor

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,320
okay keep in mind that she will break

1005
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
your arm all right and

1006
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,760
this is a really interesting thing to

1007
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,439
talk about a colon

1008
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,280
a coronal mass ejection cme event

1009
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,119
now we've had through history we've had

1010
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
a couple of things happen

1011
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,280
in 1989 we had this solar flare that

1012
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,598
collapsed the ontario quebec

1013
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,560
a power grid yeah no one cares because

1014
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,359
it's canada

1015
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,200
but i'm just saying it can happen okay

1016
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,078
we had six million people

1017
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,879
now a larger event that looks like that

1018
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,760
that hits

1019
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,800
the earth is gonna do a couple of things

1020
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,200
uh it's gonna

1021
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,079
generate an inordinate amount of help

1022
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,240
desk calls

1023
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,480
no i'm kidding it's gonna it's gonna do

1024
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,359
that but it's gonna do a whole lot more

1025
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,240
if we lose some of those large transfer

1026
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,078
transformers

1027
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,000
especially the ones for instance that

1028
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,280
power our electric trains

1029
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,680
or plants or things like that right

1030
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,520
we are going to have essentially a giant

1031
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,839
reboot that we'll have to do

1032
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,920
and who here really enjoys rebooting

1033
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,040
ancient servers on a friday before a

1034
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,920
long weekend

1035
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,359
anyone yeah exactly it's like i also

1036
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,520
like to stab myself in an

1037
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,920
eye and my hobbies include pepper

1038
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,079
spraying myself

1039
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,680
so this is this is a major problem

1040
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,440
because we have systems especially

1041
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
national critical infrastructure we've

1042
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,119
never

1043
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,040
turned off okay now one of the problems

1044
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,520
is is they've also been there for maybe

1045
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,079
30

1046
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,839
40 50 years so the people that actually

1047
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,280
turned it on the first time

1048
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,599
they're dead so now you're gonna have to

1049
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,400
do

1050
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,160
some of the most amazing feats which

1051
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
it's possible to do

1052
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,520
but you gotta have a lot of time and

1053
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,560
effort

1054
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,119
and potentially money to do so the

1055
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,920
turning machine has anyone seen that

1056
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,960
um at the betchley national computing

1057
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,520
center

1058
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,440
yeah a few of those did you know that

1059
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,560
some of the machines that they used

1060
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,640
to try and decode the enemy stuff they

1061
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,839
rebuilt from scratch by looking at a

1062
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,920
couple of pictures

1063
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,599
of it to try and figure out how it

1064
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,200
worked okay

1065
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,440
we might be into the same situation

1066
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
when we're trying to bring up all of

1067
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,320
these systems

1068
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,520
that we have without what

1069
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,440
without the three key things that i tell

1070
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,040
everybody that wants to get into cyber

1071
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,680
security to say

1072
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,520
in a goddamn interview here they are

1073
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,759
what's the first thing

1074
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,560
my passion is network diagrams

1075
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,960
my passion is configuration management

1076
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
and asset management

1077
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,640
you don't need a third thing because by

1078
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,520
then you're hired

1079
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,720
okay it's that simple you want to get

1080
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,680
into cyber security

1081
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,240
do stuff that no one else wants to do

1082
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,319
right

1083
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,720
that's it but i'll tell you right now

1084
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,359
people that are good with documentation

1085
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,078
for network and for systems and that

1086
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,720
kind of stuff

1087
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,680
they rise really quickly because what do

1088
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,040
executives not

1089
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,000
understand anything in email or chat

1090
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,720
what do they understand pictures all

1091
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,960
right

1092
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,279
so if you can express something as a

1093
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,400
picture where others have failed

1094
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,200
you will be employable and you will be a

1095
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,560
very rich person very quickly

1096
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,799
so that's it for me uh

1097
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,599
thank you so much i know we ended a bit

1098
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,520
early

1099
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,760
but that's so that you can all get super

1100
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:58,038
depressed

1101
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:58,039
[Applause]

1102
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,160
yeah but one of the problems is that

1103
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,680
if i build my house in a place that gets

1104
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,480
flooded right

1105
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,879
and then i get insurance it doesn't

1106
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,800
cover the cost usually of moving me to a

1107
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,440
new place or a new house

1108
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,599
in a place that doesn't get flooded so

1109
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,000
there's a flaw in the system that allows

1110
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,880
you to continue to rebuild in the same

1111
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,200
place only to get flooded again and

1112
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,520
unfortunately we saw that on the um

1113
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,480
we saw that on the news on bbc where

1114
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,160
they're

1115
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,079
where they're interviewing these poor

1116
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
folks in wales and yorkshire i think it

1117
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,000
was

1118
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,520
who would be like this is the eighth

1119
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
time we've been flooded

1120
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,920
and i'm like well why can't those people

1121
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
move and they're like no they get paid

1122
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,240
to rebuild

1123
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,680
in the same spot right it seems

1124
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,000
counterintuitive i'd be like

1125
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
i will pay you more to never pay have to

1126
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,720
pay you again

1127
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,839
for flood damages like here's an extra

1128
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,000
100 100k like by then can you imagine

1129
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,839
making eight flood claims like how they

1130
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,720
even still get insurance is beyond me

1131
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,240
right

1132
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,759
like it certainly doesn't happen in

1133
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,200
north america it's like

1134
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
usually a one hit or two hit deal right

1135
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
there are some other things that i

1136
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
didn't get a chance to talk about that i

1137
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,078
really wanted to

1138
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,359
was one of the things about ocean cable

1139
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,920
and hurricanes they know likey um

1140
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,200
at all and one of the problems is is um

1141
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,280
you get these wave

1142
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,399
actions happening this is where like

1143
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,079
post hurricane

1144
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
you hear about like ships that have been

1145
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,000
unburied and stuff like this

1146
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,440
well post hurricane you don't hear about

1147
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
the fact that some of these cables have

1148
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,920
been literally ripped out of their

1149
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,560
seamounts

1150
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,240
um and stuff like that now they're

1151
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,920
starting to bury them

1152
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,919
uh they used to just kind of lay them

1153
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,000
across the ocean and that also seemed to

1154
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,640
attract sharks weirdly enough

1155
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,079
there's some some interesting footage of

1156
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,920
uh sharks attacking

1157
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,440
undersea cables i guess they think

1158
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,760
they're like a giant

1159
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,880
bitey um you know food type source

1160
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
anything else other facts from my mind

1161
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,680
will spill out as we go on any other

1162
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,920
questions

1163
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,720
all right let's not build data centers

1164
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,839
where

1165
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,839
in basements all right guys thanks
