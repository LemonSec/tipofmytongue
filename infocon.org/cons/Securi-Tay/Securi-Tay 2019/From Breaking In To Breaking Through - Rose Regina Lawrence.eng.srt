1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:09,879
so hi my name is Royce Regina I am the

2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:13,059
digital security coordinator at an NGO

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:16,450
based in Berlin that means that I do a

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:19,210
certain amount of internal support I

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,600
provide workshops for some of our

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:26,140
partner organizations and I write and

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,279
maintain external facing security

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:34,290
education resources and I'm here to talk

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:36,640
a little bit about social engineering

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,879
improving security behaviors of people

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,210
around you and how some of the skills

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,230
that you can use from one are or aren't

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,170
applicable to the other so social

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,120
engineering getting people to change

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,430
what they do it's kind of just

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,260
manipulating folks to like do what you

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:02,170
want them to do sort of sort of or not

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,569
so there are a few major differences so

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,490
when we're talking about social

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,770
engineering you normally think of the

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,048
person who is doing the social

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,610
engineering being very much in control

23
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,250
whereas when you're talking about

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,610
teaching we really want to have the

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,439
learner sort of driving everything so

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,700
just backing up a moment like what do we

27
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,658
mean by social engineering because

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,619
there's this huge huge broad category of

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:34,720
stuff that falls into that bucket and so

30
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:39,158
that includes like fishing and fishing

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,009
and smishing and and all of that but it

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,560
also includes a lot of the stuff that

33
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,920
generally gets talked about in terms of

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,479
like physical penetration testing when

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,340
you're not talking about lock-picking

36
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,610
but instead you're talking about how do

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,979
you walk in places but it can also just

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,229
include this whole general category of

39
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,429
things that I tend to think of this fun

40
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,390
high jinks

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,759
we're basically what you're doing is

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,519
you're you're you're basically figuring

43
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,400
out how to set someone up to have a

44
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,209
specific emotional journey so that they

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,629
more or less do what your hope

46
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:20,269
the filter and then when we're talking

47
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:22,219
about education in this context we're

48
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,709
really talking about education for

49
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:31,719
behavior change so this is not like

50
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:36,500
memorizer times table or like learn what

51
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:38,719
the like what any specific framework is

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,579
about instead we're talking about how do

53
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,569
you get people to have better passwords

54
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:47,120
how do you get people to log out of

55
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:50,000
accounts that they're not using things

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,609
look more along those lines so so that's

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,169
what I mean what I'm talking about these

58
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:57,139
two general topics

59
00:02:54,169 --> 00:03:00,109
so aside from who's in control or who's

60
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,079
empowered in the situation there's also

61
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:04,489
a pretty major difference between

62
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,760
whether you're aiming for trust or

63
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,609
whether you're just aiming for rapport

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,700
the timeframe for doing some social

65
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,959
engineering very different than like

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,089
trying to teach your colleagues how to

67
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,639
keep themselves safe how to protect your

68
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,379
company whatever your context is even if

69
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,989
it's like your parents or your

70
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,370
housemates or anyone that you are

71
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:36,799
desperately trying to give security

72
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:38,479
advice to okay sorry about that and then

73
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,689
the other thing is the way that you use

74
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,949
emotions in social engineering should be

75
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,319
very different than the way that you're

76
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:50,829
using emotions in any kind of

77
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:56,030
educational process so part of this is

78
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:58,220
in terms of who's in control we have

79
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,849
this idea called self-efficacy it comes

80
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,939
from alfred bandura who's a psychologist

81
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,439
and basically it's the idea that someone

82
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,180
believes in their ability to do a

83
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,280
specific thing and this ends up being

84
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,449
really important when you're teaching

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,790
someone to do something because

86
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,530
basically if they believe that they can

87
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,339
do it you're going to have a much easier

88
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:21,228
time supporting them in doing it because

89
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,760
when you're talking about social

90
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,859
engineering you're generally talking

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,340
about like how do I get someone to do a

92
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,550
thing

93
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,008
but when you're talking

94
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,629
about digital security education

95
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,270
interventions you're generally talking

96
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:39,360
about how do I get someone to get

97
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:41,669
themselves to do a thing and part of

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,490
that kind of relies and part of why

99
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,960
there's this difference is when you're

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,909
talking about social engineering you're

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,560
generally talking about like just

102
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:52,590
building rapport like how do I just get

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,330
someone to like me so rapport is about

104
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,489
just like having this connection that

105
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,378
you can kind of joke with someone you

106
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,800
probably also have rapport with like

107
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,539
your colleagues which you should and and

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,250
it's generally helpful like having a

109
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:07,250
nice rapport with someone is going to

110
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,490
help you regardless of what your goal is

111
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,409
but when you're dealing with like trying

112
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,449
to actually get someone to learn and

113
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,819
change their behavior what you probably

114
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,440
need is actually trust what you probably

115
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,020
need is not just someone to be like oh

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,219
yeah that person I am you know they seem

117
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,500
friendly I'd like to have a beer with

118
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:27,300
them but probably what you need is for

119
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,650
someone to believe the things that

120
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,539
you're saying and to believe that

121
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,219
they're accurate and to believe that you

122
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,289
have their best interests at heart or

123
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:38,279
that it's like close enough that they're

124
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:40,409
willing to roll with it so the other

125
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,630
thing in terms of like trust versus

126
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,849
rapport is like you can find all sorts

127
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,190
of excellent and excellent guides to how

128
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,469
to quickly build rapport trust tends to

129
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,800
take a lot more time you can also break

130
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:54,719
rapport and Trust fairly quickly but

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,889
Trust is what you really need to like

132
00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:03,389
build in in your relationships so just

133
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,819
like trust and rapport take different

134
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,199
amounts of time to establish when you're

135
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,270
dealing with social engineering you're

136
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,750
almost always only needing to like keep

137
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,948
stuff together until you get out like if

138
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,080
you're doing some kind of like

139
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,270
face-to-face thing you just have to make

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
sure that they believe you as long as

141
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,930
they're looking at you or as long as

142
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,340
they're less likely to call someone

143
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,150
who's going to get you in trouble like

144
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,429
that's all you need the glamour to last

145
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:32,489
but when you're dealing with any kind of

146
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,779
behavior change education what you

147
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,669
really need is something that's going to

148
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,419
stick with people and that's going to be

149
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,280
long-lasting

150
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,659
so it's not just like

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,000
while I am standing there with my

152
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,470
coworker get them to do the one thing

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,850
I'm asking them to do this one time

154
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,520
while I'm looking over their shoulder

155
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,139
but can I set them up so that they're

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,299
gonna do this thing that I've asked them

157
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,570
to do and shown them how to do

158
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,460
repeatedly over time and as long as

159
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,680
we're talking about timeframes it's

160
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,138
really good to remember that everything

161
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,290
fades over time so when you're thinking

162
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,090
about education and when you're thinking

163
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,620
about like teaching or training people

164
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,630
around you it's good to remember that

165
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,630
they will probably need blake little

166
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,070
refreshers and to just plan on that and

167
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,150
it doesn't mean that you've failed and

168
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,099
it definitely doesn't mean that they've

169
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:26,859
failed if they need a little bit of a

170
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:28,870
reminder from time to time so another

171
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,400
area where there's this huge huge gap

172
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,970
but a certain amount of shared shared

173
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,510
skills is when we talk about the role of

174
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,550
fear especially in social engineering

175
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,020
and education so like when you're doing

176
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,330
social engineering if you get someone a

177
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,099
little scared it's generally good

178
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,990
because people who are scared don't

179
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,720
really respond the way they probably

180
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,010
should so if you're trying to like get

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,050
someone to do something that they're not

182
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,610
technically supposed to getting them a

183
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,710
little bit scared can mean that they

184
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,950
don't have the presence of mind and they

185
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,479
can't Center themselves well enough to

186
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,380
really like think through what they're

187
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,360
supposed to be doing however when you're

188
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,659
doing something that is about teaching

189
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,280
that's the opposite of what you want and

190
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,280
you generally have a situation where

191
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,580
when you're teaching someone if they get

192
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,080
scared they're going to zone out they're

193
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,690
going to tune out they're just going to

194
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,969
like shut down a little bit and some of

195
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,130
that is because just like you can get

196
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,289
really really successful or some people

197
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,450
can get really successful with like

198
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,338
creating fear and then immediately

199
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,810
offering a solution like the classic is

200
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,870
you have a virus install this software

201
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,729
to remove it all that's doing is

202
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,730
creating fear and then offering a

203
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:53,370
pathway to release or relief from it and

204
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,370
so when you're talking about education

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,120
the pathway for relief tends to be

206
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,430
shutting down and ignoring you so if you

207
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,380
if you if you're hitting that fear

208
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,969
button a whole bunch it may be great

209
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,930
when you're trying to manipulate people

210
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,910
but it's going to be very

211
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,279
counterproductive when you're actually

212
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,300
trying to get people to understand and

213
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,430
internalize what you're talking about

214
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,410
so the other thing that's worth

215
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,300
mentioning is like yes you may talk

216
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,120
about scary topics depending on what

217
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,769
your work is and depending on what kinds

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,029
of trainings you may need to talk to

219
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,149
your colleagues about some of them are

220
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:34,069
scary but if you can figure out ways of

221
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:36,620
reducing the height of the fear that

222
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,819
they're experiencing or the the height

223
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,699
of whatever emotions they're

224
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:44,599
experiencing you're much less likely to

225
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:48,560
have that whole search for relief and

226
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,110
avoidance of the topic so basically

227
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,279
feelings matter feelings matter a whole

228
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,380
lot and they matter not just for the

229
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,410
people your training or teaching but

230
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,819
they also matter for yourself so there

231
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,910
are a few really counterproductive

232
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:06,500
effects of using like standard social

233
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,959
engineering where you're just like I

234
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,459
know how to manipulate some folks I know

235
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,750
how to get places I'm not supposed to go

236
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,180
I know how to get a free cup of coffee

237
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,220
like all of that if you're using that on

238
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,599
your co-workers there's a really good

239
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,240
chance that you might be normalizing

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,069
certain types of risky behaviors so that

241
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,810
can include like getting them to

242
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,719
override security controls instead of

243
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,768
really talking them through it can be

244
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,180
getting information from them because

245
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,620
it's easier to just get it from them

246
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,649
than until I go through the right

247
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,500
pathways just all of that your you're

248
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,660
training them into being vulnerable to

249
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,990
the kinds of techniques that you or some

250
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,269
actual bad guy might be using or mom so

251
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,040
the other really major problem with a

252
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:50,600
lot of social engineering techniques

253
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,370
especially in a work place is kind of

254
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,380
inherently when you go in and you try to

255
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,009
manipulate people you are being a creepy

256
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,529
creeper like it's just not nice and so

257
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:01,579
sometimes you're totally successful and

258
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,810
you get away with it and you have the

259
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,829
problems I mentioned on the last slide

260
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,489
but

261
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:10,700
sometimes you have a colleague who's a

262
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,320
little bit more sensitive and who has

263
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,490
maybe like gone through some of that

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,340
training and instead what you're doing

265
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,110
is you're you're pushing the bad guy

266
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,720
buttons and this can potentially set off

267
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,280
their spidey sense and have them just

268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,460
immediately categorize you as sort of a

269
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,319
bad actor and that means that you end up

270
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,960
alienating the people who are best

271
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,030
positioned to help you you it means that

272
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,520
you are alienating the people who have

273
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,020
the sensitivity to this stuff and could

274
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,630
be bringing it to your attention when it

275
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,760
shows up instead you're making yourself

276
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,760
someone that those people specifically

277
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,189
do not want to approach and that just

278
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,950
generally drives people away and it can

279
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:58,040
also really feed into shadow IT type

280
00:11:51,950 --> 00:12:01,370
problems so this is a pretty good

281
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,780
example of things that go wrong when you

282
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,940
think that social engineering is the

283
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,780
appropriate way to approach everyone in

284
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,390
your mind so I've talked a bunch about

285
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,490
like the disconnects and what doesn't

286
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,170
work but there are a whole bunch of

287
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,700
skills from social engineering that do

288
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,979
work really well when you're doing

289
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,840
educational interventions with both of

290
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,490
them you need to handle someone else's

291
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,830
emotions and you should create this nice

292
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,080
journey that takes them along the path

293
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,810
that they need to go either to give you

294
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,760
something they shouldn't or to like get

295
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,000
to a point where they can get themselves

296
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,710
to have better security behaviors and

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,710
it's really about like orienting towards

298
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,080
someone else's needs there's a huge

299
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,050
benefit to being able to really respond

300
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,990
to emotional cues and elicit to a CA and

301
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,630
techniques are huge in both like being

302
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,850
able to ask good questions that either

303
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,590
help you get good information or help

304
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,150
steer other people to where they need to

305
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,400
be is incredibly powerful

306
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,280
um and with that just like know your own

307
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,600
strengths and weaknesses build on your

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,400
strengths figure out how to counteract

309
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,290
your weaknesses ideally not the other

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,150
way around so when you're dealing with

311
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,370
adults one thing that can be really

312
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,720
useful is this idea of adult learning

313
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,990
theory

314
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,819
and so it's this like whole area there

315
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,790
are many many books on it you could read

316
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,219
thoughts um or or not because it can

317
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,779
basically be summarized as it's not just

318
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,000
that the person is in the dot meaning

319
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,069
it's not just that they're over 18 it

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,540
has to do with being ready to learn and

321
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:36,269
open to what you're saying

322
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,709
so this is not about awareness-raising

323
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:39,629
this is not about getting someone to

324
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,670
recognize that security is a problem

325
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,970
when you're talking about actual

326
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,430
education and actual learning that part

327
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,470
has to already be addressed that's

328
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,329
actually somewhere where a rapport can

329
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,189
be really helpful if you're having a

330
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:55,439
little bit of a rough time meeting with

331
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,990
someone having a report can help them

332
00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:00,300
open up a bit and be receptive to what

333
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,120
you're trying to teach them but the four

334
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,219
principles are basically you need to

335
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,259
have the people you're trying to teach

336
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,740
be involved and this can be asking them

337
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,649
about their concerns or just like asking

338
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,490
what things they want to learn

339
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:17,339
you should be drawing on their

340
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,259
experiences so like talk to them and ask

341
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,120
them what they have noticed that relates

342
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,000
to this or if they've ever gotten like a

343
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,339
spammy email or whatever it is so that

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,309
they're able to access and connect it to

345
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:34,500
things they already now make it relevant

346
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:37,559
people are generally not willing to like

347
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,620
spend lots of time learning stuff that

348
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,180
they don't see the point of and then try

349
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,800
to be problem centered instead of

350
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,849
content centered to teach them how to

351
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,670
address something but you know also

352
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,709
balance it out with like based knowledge

353
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:58,769
that that can be helpful for them more

354
00:14:52,709 --> 00:15:00,779
broadly as you're learning how to get

355
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,089
better at teaching other people it's

356
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,399
really good to learn from others as well

357
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,930
so when you go to talks when you go to

358
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,480
presentations think about what people

359
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,758
have done that have worked really well

360
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,889
but when you do that just keep in mind

361
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:18,240
that different kinds of situations have

362
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:20,009
different goals in terms of what people

363
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,309
are learning sometimes it's just about

364
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:25,040
facts sometimes it's broad frameworks

365
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:27,139
sometimes it's about behaviors and habit

366
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,279
and you also have different kinds of

367
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,449
audiences some of them are more

368
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,050
technical some of them are less

369
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,579
technical how familiar you are or how

370
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,310
formal the setting it is I'll make a

371
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,380
difference so just be mindful if you see

372
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,268
something that works really well it may

373
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:47,290
only work really well for that kind of

374
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:50,600
learning or for that kind of audience so

375
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,310
hopefully either in a place if you're

376
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,199
doing this kind of like teaching to

377
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,130
others where you really want to support

378
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,569
them in being successful and some good

379
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,120
ways of making sure that you're really

380
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:04,759
supporting them and that they have a

381
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,290
much greater likelihood of succeeding

382
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,829
and you have a much greater likelihood

383
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,630
of not getting called to solve the same

384
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,339
problem that you've solved like 12 times

385
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,579
previously they may be a little sick of

386
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,829
is figure out how you're actively going

387
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:20,870
to support self-efficacy like be aware

388
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,810
of like what people say when they're

389
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,120
like oh I don't feel like I can do this

390
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,420
and actually address it and help them

391
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,910
figure out what is holding them back um

392
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,819
when something is hard like sometimes

393
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,060
learning is hard to validate it don't

394
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:41,300
say well I think it's easy one trick

395
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:45,469
that I use a lot is saying yes it is

396
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,000
absolutely hard now but once you've once

397
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,769
you've done it a couple of times it's

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,480
not going to feel hard like it's hard

399
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:53,060
now but it's not going to be and that

400
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,860
also helps set expectations because it

401
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,510
may be a situation where if it continues

402
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,269
to be hard for them they're doing

403
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,410
something wrong and so this can also be

404
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,940
a way of making sure that you're

405
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,369
catching people who might fall through

406
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,230
the cracks and it's also just generally

407
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,819
good to a providing encouragement like

408
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:13,939
we could all use a little encouragement

409
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:16,339
from time to time so basically social

410
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,319
engineering and education different

411
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,319
goals

412
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:24,619
don't don't normalize bad stuff don't be

413
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,530
creepy it really helps when you know

414
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,239
what you're trying to do so even if it's

415
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,460
just like writing down point by point

416
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,960
what your goals are what kind of things

417
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,429
you want to cover what success looks

418
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,490
like for you what success might look

419
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,020
like for them all that can help you

420
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,160
put together something that's more

421
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,370
likely to actually work and then just

422
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,780
like be decent to the people around you

423
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,780
it's not just about like being a nice

424
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,000
person it also really does help and it

425
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,800
really will make you more effective but

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,340
you should also just be decent to people

427
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:02,620
like it's not it's not that big an ass

428
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:04,000
so that's it I am happy to take

429
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,340
questions but I think I have like a

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,830
minute and a half before I'm done but

431
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:15,399
come find me afterwards I will be around

432
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,750
and you should all stick around because

433
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,200
the next clock looks really interesting

434
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:24,640
and that's about a hire machine learning

435
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,350
machine armor very different but clearly

436
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,420
no one has taught me balling up from the

437
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,419
newsroom is right now anyway thank you
