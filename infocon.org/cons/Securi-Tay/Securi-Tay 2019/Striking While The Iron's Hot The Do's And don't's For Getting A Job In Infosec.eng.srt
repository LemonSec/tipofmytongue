9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,390
introduction could can college us

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,720
yourselves I'm Dan Don tweets on Twitter

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:42,249
please for me sure I'm Jack and I'm not

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:46,510
gonna some James I hope to be tea and it

13
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:47,829
was okay so the reason we did this

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,390
funnel that's obviously are the do's and

15
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,399
don'ts of getting Indian Cossack because

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,230
there's a lot of information I dare

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,579
apply getting a job and talents to the

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,129
questions that people have when they

19
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,690
start to go into an industry but a lot

20
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,010
of it does come from different sources

21
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,920
which also you have different ideas

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,628
about it and because M for second

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,549
industry is so dynamic there doesn't

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,020
really seem to be one truth to change

25
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,899
like getting a job and it seems to be

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,399
different for different people so what

27
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,200
we've discovered and are written like

28
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:16,240
when we discuss this originally was it

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,930
are Richard we're very different and the

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,699
the advice wasn't quite universal so um

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,680
and such a dynamic industry we realized

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,479
that because we've just been for the

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,380
process ourselves for context if you're

34
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,780
on there where all of us were juniors

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,719
did it haven't been in the industry that

36
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,359
long so um where we essentially asked

37
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:40,179
everyone a question or we asked police

38
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:41,919
Twitter followers a question the to tell

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,960
us will what are they wondering most

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,340
about the industry because we understand

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,939
that it's different for everyone and the

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,609
Trinity is no yellow brick road as to

43
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:54,038
how you get a job so we're gonna go

44
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,899
through three categories of questions we

45
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,320
received we sent over Twitter and

46
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,030
LinkedIn

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,008
I'm Leon you know quite a few responses

48
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,990
we got a healthy response about it but

49
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,380
there's the book the questions mainly

50
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,460
with the exception of 50 trolls online

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,780
followed the three separate categories

52
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,549
so there's try to develop your Barker

53
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,880
and then informations

54
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,770
maybe you're currently maybe you're

55
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,940
currently like in university now and

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,250
you're looking to develop your

57
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,930
background so that you can become

58
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,740
employable or potentially you're

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,690
currently going through the application

60
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,950
process which varies from company to

61
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,870
company and there's no clear answer on

62
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,310
on anything to do that really

63
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,480
and then once you've got the job once

64
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,540
you've secured that in your position

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,429
there's a lot of questions about like

66
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,959
like working life and like what how you

67
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,310
keep up skilling and how to keep

68
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,540
developing your career once you're

69
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,600
actually in the job so I think just a

70
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,530
essentially before before the job so how

71
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
did you guys get in the industry

72
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,420
starting guitar

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
sure so I studied here Alberti used to

74
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,760
attend in security and setting in talks

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,850
like this the deathblow hacking degree

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,570
he finished that up um pretty much it

77
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:04,079
pretty linear from a degree to a job -

78
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,390
completely different I did a year of

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
college dropped out didn't really want

80
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,309
to go to uni so I ended up going to a

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,430
friendship new software Hama instead

82
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,590
that company collapse was made redundant

83
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,320
and luckily I was able to get another

84
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,590
event ship which is my mom general IT

85
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,570
and eventually while I was there over

86
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,260
the course of a year or so it change

87
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:31,410
into more governance like policy kind of

88
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,660
stuff not too technical and that evolved

89
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,020
into a more technical role and now I do

90
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,850
more security operations mire and stuff

91
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,100
like that and that's how it kind of got

92
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,170
to where I am now

93
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,810
yeah I kind of did everything a bit

94
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,690
backwards I like him went to college

95
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,590
hated it got any of the media studies

96
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,140
but I did nothing with and then I was

97
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,670
working full-time in a bar and you learn

98
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,019
after being full-time in a bar for

99
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,958
awhile that being full-time to borrow

100
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,640
some great fun so I routed from

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,160
Cambridgeshire and moved up to Leeds

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,160
where I did a foundation degree and then

103
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,600
well after a year sucked off and moved

104
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,609
over to Beckett where I'm currently

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,409
doing forensics and security yeah so I

106
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,750
guess I'm not somebody to eject here so

107
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,789
very conventional so do University had

108
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,779
an internship came out of university and

109
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,729
played for tons of

110
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,619
jobs I got a great job with Beauty

111
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,120
security and that's kind of where I am

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,250
these days and it just reference about

113
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,620
what do you work at night what's your

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,380
actual role so I work as a secure

115
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,120
patient center analyst so that's things

116
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,990
like monitoring alerts triaging the

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,650
fixing things

118
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,630
Craig projects for generally fixing

119
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,929
technical security issues that's

120
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,580
anything from vulnerabilities to

121
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,260
completely redesigning things and

122
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,469
building them an implement in them

123
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,820
things like that okay so getting into

124
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,590
the questions you're safe the first one

125
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,270
is what are some things that you did

126
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,729
stand out I think this one refers to

127
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,990
kind of a like very much before being in

128
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,470
the building in the workplaces I don't

129
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,150
have any things to share but um

130
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,470
yes there's a whole ton of different

131
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,929
things you can do to make yourself stand

132
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,669
out as a candidate because employers are

133
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,680
gonna get more than was about controller

134
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,349
jobs so you need to do things outside of

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,470
just studying to make yourself stand out

136
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,180
an employer and sure that you care and

137
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,650
you're a bit more passionate rather than

138
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,310
just doing a degree in getting a job for

139
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,169
the sake of it

140
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,030
so there's a whole lot of different

141
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,789
things you can do you can do like

142
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,830
relevant volunteering experience

143
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:40,020
part-time work that's relevant

144
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,820
internships you can apply to conferences

145
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,380
to speak which is really really valuable

146
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,270
or even just comment as an attendee

147
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,700
because when you come here you're

148
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,770
spending money to come even if it's only

149
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,260
20 quid for a ticket but that just shows

150
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,909
that you care past just doing a degree

151
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,090
it takes up an entire Friday as well

152
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,520
always asking yeah with that in mind

153
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,840
it's also with using that time as an

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,820
opportunity to figure out what you want

155
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,500
to do so having all that spare time and

156
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,390
figuring I really like writing articles

157
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,400
I really like public speaking so I

158
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,539
really like doing podcasts and then

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,060
that's not the to news then to take that

160
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,539
further either when you have a job or go

161
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,830
for it okay and I think because the

162
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,120
question is more in respect to what you

163
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,830
actually learn what you feel like

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,479
yourself did because I mean with

165
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,169
reservation Isis to do yourself right so

166
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,849
how you do in your experience so I did a

167
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,950
few public speaking engagements

168
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,800
primarily at the Hocking society we have

169
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,180
at university it's a really good way to

170
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,069
get to public speaking because it's very

171
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,159
welcomed and very supportive

172
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,680
passed out I support car b-sides Libby

173
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,930
Ana last year which actually resulted in

174
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,839
a job offer an offer on the spot as soon

175
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,279
as the top finished I was offered an

176
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,469
internship part-time with the Scotch

177
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,058
business resilience centre it was a

178
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,369
really great opportunity it was an

179
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:55,649
introduction to pain tests in working

180
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,969
with clients writing reports and they

181
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,409
were really flexible because they

182
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:00,029
understand that you're a student and

183
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,159
you're trying to do this job at the same

184
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,020
time so there's a lot of different

185
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:08,849
things you can do just for the sake of

186
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,430
getting through the question so it like

187
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:13,199
as a summary just like attending

188
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,550
extracurricular I like activities

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,979
conferences just like networking with

190
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,349
people that's with the stuff I didn't

191
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,628
know if you're at the societies that you

192
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,370
you know do committee mulch you know I

193
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,339
know with our society being on committee

194
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,620
really helped cuz it make you do things

195
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,259
no I know of course like I said with

196
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,779
that new CEQA and myself era for those

197
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,339
really don't know how I was part of

198
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,770
university and I'm still armed but I

199
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,110
used to be part of the other music are a

200
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,370
security society and like getting

201
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,680
involved in the organization a lot

202
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,569
really did like open doors which just

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,009
seemed not to be there before I started

204
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,020
so that's definitely something to

205
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:53,009
consider if you have one if not

206
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,448
essentially answer so depending on where

207
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,699
your experiences in university

208
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,699
beneficial for securing your first job

209
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,300
yeah I'm gonna start this and everybody

210
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,068
obviously have different opinions but

211
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,959
you know University really is like it's

212
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,419
what you make of the experience you know

213
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,490
sitting in a lecture you know where

214
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,409
someone's going that this is security is

215
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,999
that isn't practical that doesn't get

216
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,039
you the job and and as we've said before

217
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:19,889
you know it's about what we're doing

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
around it and university as a bubble is

219
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,029
a really good environment to like

220
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,009
nurture that I think so it's like the

221
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,289
experience of going university I than

222
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,879
the actual nice and I think a lot of it

223
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,870
as well at learning from other people

224
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,010
who are in the same position because

225
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,690
obviously everybody knows different

226
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,549
things and cares about different things

227
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,349
so you're there and you're being exposed

228
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,059
to so much whereas if you are sat in

229
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,820
your bedroom reading a book it's a very

230
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,579
different experience I guess

231
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,660
and and Brent you said at the start you

232
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,430
didn't get you didn't go to university

233
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,630
and it hasn't been it hasn't a barrier

234
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,579
to you in the industry no no my work

235
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,260
that I've done is through meeting people

236
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,530
and experiencing things like you said

237
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,930
but I found that it's been very easy to

238
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,850
do with meetups and conferences and just

239
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,760
talking to people getting involved in

240
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,160
different projects and I've not really

241
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,460
found a barrier that's needed me to be

242
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,050
at university at all I was gonna say I'm

243
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,910
gonna be the flipside of that and so I

244
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,890
find universities super important yeah

245
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,360
because it's that backbone especially if

246
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,790
you don't have that knowledge beforehand

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,020
it kind of sets you on that level to

248
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,550
make sure that you have that backbone

249
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
you know you're talking about and then

250
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,400
you can pivot off that you go to

251
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,730
conferences you do these meetups

252
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,449
whatever but if I think universities a

253
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,430
great way a solid my dish yeah I can

254
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,730
speak for myself that I wouldn't have

255
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,170
had like with experiences in university

256
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,450
being outside of classes like I

257
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,280
certainly nothing with security before

258
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,020
like going to university and although I

259
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,600
wasn't necessarily studying security I

260
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,460
did saw for engineering it's still like

261
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,960
going to the University like in a

262
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,420
structured learning and like having that

263
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,190
kind of time surrounded by people here

264
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,670
so passion the way it really did kind of

265
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:02,900
like definitely helped me secure my

266
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:06,650
first job but I'm from that how did you

267
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,300
make your Browns see I think making a

268
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,850
brand yourself is making your image as a

269
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,410
person like you know I kind of did media

270
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,780
so I was always that very creative

271
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,089
person's like I played on that so when I

272
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,069
tended the security the first year I

273
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,660
made these really low-key business cards

274
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,130
and everybody in the society like that's

275
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,240
hilarious don't do that you're gonna get

276
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,770
mocked but when you're having

277
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,440
conversations with people it's memorable

278
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,090
it's like if you're this person that

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,990
someone stood and spoken to you for ten

280
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,150
minutes then you give them something

281
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,640
like you know they'll remember you more

282
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,590
I think so I think I started with that

283
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,270
and obviously you can build like blogs

284
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,220
and I think Twitter presence is

285
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,900
important as well like you can engage

286
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,310
with the community and people can gauge

287
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,890
the kind of person you are from that

288
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,089
yeah so now I can see a few juices from

289
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,890
Twitter in here so it's it's definitely

290
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,240
a very good like networking tool but in

291
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,610
order to like this we've had the tech

292
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,019
off

293
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,750
every day at the air so it's nice deal

294
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:58,950
to know who's me really and I'm not not

295
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,930
to say that but it's it's very funny

296
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah I think I think off that point is

297
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,870
what clothes saying is it's all about

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,610
content creation right so if you're

299
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,660
really interested in something means

300
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,459
that someone else is going to be

301
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,199
interested in that same thing so you

302
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,459
have read articles make blog post write

303
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,860
code or that kind of stuff

304
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,420
and it's all about sharing that I think

305
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,940
I've being integrated in that community

306
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,040
yeah I think I think that sharing is

307
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,390
very important because I'd I know a lot

308
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,949
of people who struggle with that kind of

309
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,089
like just like putting stuff either

310
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,980
because there no other that's not good

311
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,240
enough and like one of it's like what if

312
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,470
someone can pack a hole in it but even

313
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,910
if they put a hole no and even if they

314
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,380
say it's bad still better than having

315
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,850
nothing night like it still I mean like

316
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,140
you like you're hardly proving and

317
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,519
confidence or any confidence just

318
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,350
because you've released something which

319
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,760
isn't picture-perfect that's like the

320
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,110
benefit of releasing things and like

321
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,399
getting your name right there and being

322
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,140
introduced to people who like the same

323
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,029
stuff is definitely a ways that kind of

324
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,490
this even if you get stuff wrong and

325
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,110
you'd be corrected don't treat it is you

326
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,700
being wrong because identity you're

327
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,510
still a student treat it as a learning

328
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,190
experience

329
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,319
Tico's constructive criticism rather

330
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,920
than negative criticism and use that to

331
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
improve and get better

332
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,570
okay so I'm moving on from that that was

333
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,640
um that was before before any jobs would

334
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,290
not have done applying for a job some

335
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,279
questions regarding applications or

336
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,800
running to be building on certain things

337
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,750
so our first one here is with online

338
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,180
application forms and test Shiggy on to

339
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,860
the questions obviously Oh as an aisle I

340
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,439
believe the company is looking for so I

341
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,779
think I can say that yes you on to

342
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,279
the questions honestly because you

343
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,110
shouldn't apply on an application I

344
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,120
didn't really set up to set up does

345
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,529
anyone have any insights about the type

346
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
of questions that we get asked and like

347
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,560
how we should approach answering them

348
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,699
yes I think that this question we did

349
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,768
spend some time about it because the

350
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,170
question was well do you

351
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:43,350
what is lying in an application actually

352
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,459
mean we said yeah hands down none of us

353
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,540
should lie in applications right we

354
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,209
shouldn't lie about hard skills we

355
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,640
shouldn't lie about students but when it

356
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,410
comes to soft skills I think it is super

357
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,029
important to take that step back and to

358
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,010
go actually what's the company looking

359
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,360
for here how can I move with this

360
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,850
competitor and answering these questions

361
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,740
how'd it be exactly and I think that's

362
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,360
not the sort of lying but it's showing

363
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,380
that you have those skills by taking

364
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,120
them step back

365
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,220
we are our own biggest critic at the end

366
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,080
of the day like like it's it's it's it's

367
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,730
very important to understand like a

368
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,840
jollification so here you like you

369
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,120
aren't going to be selling your services

370
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,950
to this company and so you should like

371
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,840
really think hard about like what makes

372
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,550
your services like worth selling in a

373
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,260
sense unlike and that's not to say that

374
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,760
like some people don't have services on

375
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,380
hard we are all valuable as employees

376
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,540
it's about finding what makes you a

377
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,160
particular value I mean like and there's

378
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,990
it's not a crime to highlight things

379
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,339
which will like what you like about

380
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,960
yourself or the skills you think you

381
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,370
have I got that as well like you can

382
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,830
tell a lot about a company from what

383
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,210
they're asking you so in that process of

384
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,250
applying and writing things down it's

385
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,780
like you know you're thinking well am i

386
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,820
suitable for this thing is this a place

387
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:53,280
and environment I want to be and you can

388
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:55,620
normally gauge that through the way but

389
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,540
yeah honestly honesty is absolutely key

390
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,060
among reviews so I be sitting in

391
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,439
interviews and they said how to program

392
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,449
experience how much development have you

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,920
done I've been fully honest setting an

394
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,440
interview in front of two people and

395
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,250
said I'm a terrible programmer I'm not

396
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,470
going to pretend that we're good

397
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,670
programmer because if they give me after

398
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,710
knowing the lines of code to do record

399
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,930
review on it's not gonna stand a chance

400
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,790
and so it's better to be honest

401
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,469
companies will accept that don't accept

402
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,939
especially as a junior that you don't

403
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,160
know everything and they will not expect

404
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,260
you to know everything being kind of all

405
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,670
that because although it simple it's not

406
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,230
what you said Tennyson is not one to

407
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,670
sell yourself no I think it's really

408
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,840
easy to kind of understand something

409
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,550
civil actually this actually again

410
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,470
taking a step back and of critical about

411
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,000
vision himself and sin actually I am

412
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,870
pretty good at this these two things

413
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,670
maybe one thing I see is go through

414
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,590
things that I've done in the past and

415
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,760
see what skills and I'm just looking if

416
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,380
I was looking at it from someone else's

417
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,670
perspective and like well let's say if I

418
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,490
look behind see they pretend it's my

419
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,530
friends and then it says oh I develop

420
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,080
this project or I did this thing what

421
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,819
skills do they demonstrate when they say

422
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,380
they've done that and then using those

423
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,090
like the skills which commonly come up

424
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,910
so that's their first if I've done a lot

425
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,320
of programming and then I like I keep

426
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,670
getting okay what skills of money that's

427
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,350
like attention to detail and like

428
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,329
programming experience and so on then I

429
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,400
would like be comfortable using those as

430
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,230
skills and the job application even

431
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,550
though like I'm up

432
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,890
might offer to like consider myself

433
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,569
perfectly go to programming or or I

434
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,189
might like consider myself like like

435
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,990
Bartman area because it keeps coming up

436
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,950
in my previous experience and so on so

437
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,330
it's a good it's a good tool to consider

438
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,280
what experience you have and then see

439
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,460
what skills you can get from that

440
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,510
listens

441
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,830
so moving on how long do you tease if

442
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,130
I'm putting form and is it is a

443
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,710
different depending on their size to

444
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:47,240
this it varies depending on the size and

445
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:49,010
it varies depending on the job so when I

446
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,960
applied to my current employer they were

447
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,480
pretty small or it's a pretty quick

448
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,820
application process still did generally

449
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,350
get back to you pretty quicker

450
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,380
conversely I applied to some very very

451
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,850
large enterprises and they got back to

452
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,670
me I think three weeks ago and off a

453
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,230
minute with you and I applied December

454
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:11,060
are you and a quarter ago so how long it

455
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,740
takes companies to get back to you can

456
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,750
vary and massively depending on the size

457
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,760
and how much you should chase them

458
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,710
depends on how much you want your job so

459
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,590
I was very very keen I'm going to work

460
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,000
my current employer so if I hadn't heard

461
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,440
back I definitely would have chased them

462
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,930
up just to see how your applications

463
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,660
going but with that larger company I

464
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,719
just I applied more for the name rather

465
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,490
than wanting to work for them so I

466
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
wasn't particularly fussy about chasing

467
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,140
the I didn't how long would you live

468
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,579
before chasing the company right now if

469
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,430
you hadn't have received a response a

470
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,990
lot of it before maybe a few weeks I

471
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,229
found this research station application

472
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,430
and yeah it also depends how quickly

473
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,770
you're working to get into employment

474
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,609
law so I began the application process

475
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,439
in December of 2017 for starting in June

476
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,110
of 2018 fair like when I finished

477
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,180
University so there was definitely more

478
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,170
leeway because I pretty much had six

479
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,079
months to go through the application

480
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,349
process but if there was less time for

481
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,280
when you're working to start the job

482
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,939
definitely people throughout time avoid

483
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,099
chasing up yeah I definitely add to that

484
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,630
it's not rude to share sup an email and

485
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,179
it's something that I kind of felt like

486
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,860
I was father these are people with real

487
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,670
jobs you have lots of seconds today and

488
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,099
I'm just a student

489
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,300
you know I'm sure right but if they

490
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,040
don't get back to you like people are

491
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,930
busy and like cheersing and up shows

492
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,440
here enthusiastic by that job and shoes

493
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:35,120
to your I get to actually sell in your

494
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,800
mind it's not just you applied to 500

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,070
companies or not you're not worried

496
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,930
about you know so James how long were

497
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,290
you how long was your interview process

498
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:47,270
with a beating so the way the BT

499
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,850
graduate scheme to be process works it's

500
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,010
perfect for my sections I want to say so

501
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,270
you have a few online tests once you've

502
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,770
done that you don't have a phone call

503
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,020
interview it's kind of soft skills that

504
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,580
you get for the role either tech phone

505
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,930
interview and then you have an

506
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,449
assessment center that assessment

507
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,760
centers a full day in Ipswich under me

508
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,140
and then that kind of has my challenges

509
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,090
you know your hair between one

510
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,880
individual one of the network diagram

511
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,530
and so comparatively to maybe some

512
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,200
smaller companies that's quite a long

513
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,639
program and it kind of makes you

514
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,590
actually sure that you actually want to

515
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,150
work for that company if you go from

516
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,860
that entire person did you cheers

517
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,660
through I did or did you just wait for

518
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,889
they were quite good to be that then

519
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,360
quite good to make keeping you involved

520
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,460
if you keep going events and stuff like

521
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,530
that is definitely run preparing for

522
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,750
other big companies that were less

523
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,760
involved now it puts us um so how was

524
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,700
your experience with into the process

525
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,710
good and I mean I thought it was really

526
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,890
nice I mean with mindfully I work in a

527
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,870
team of four pen testers and so it's

528
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,600
like really small team as it is so when

529
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:53,870
I was going for the job I think I

530
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,490
messaged on I was set an email because

531
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,500
he had my boss had a challenge on the

532
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,700
website so I sent my email literally at

533
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,920
four in the morning I've got reply to

534
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,460
five in the morning because my boss is

535
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,170
nuts

536
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,080
made a great way and a great way people

537
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,970
but yeah so for me I think when we

538
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,980
actually started the interview it was

539
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,960
really informal because I with small

540
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,640
companies you're not doing massive

541
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,500
technical interviews a lot of the time

542
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,000
you know it's more about fitting into

543
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,420
the team and you know what can you offer

544
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,880
so we just went for lunch like you

545
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,410
literally little hotel in Cambridge went

546
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,570
and sat had some lunch and just have a

547
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,550
chat and and it was a very like honest

548
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,990
it's like you know he asked me some

549
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,169
technical questions and some soft

550
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,900
questions and yeah it was just more

551
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,940
about gauging how you defend the team

552
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,440
rather than you know what your

553
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,580
experience level is I mean

554
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,049
I think at the end of it especially with

555
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,029
junior positions I can't speak when they

556
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,799
ask but like you know everybody is aware

557
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,909
that you know there are gonna be areas

558
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,679
missing but that's the whole point

559
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,659
because you're building up your skills

560
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,480
over especially the internships over the

561
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:55,159
year so you know it's interesting that

562
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,360
you mention like soft skills in

563
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,250
particular because I imagine this part

564
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,418
of a small team that it is quite I mean

565
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,129
not getting on with your colleague is

566
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,330
quite this is quite important and you

567
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:05,178
only got like a number of them right so

568
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,158
like yeah that involve was it like this

569
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,500
thing I mean everything for us is very

570
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,929
much like slack based and chassis anyway

571
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,549
so you know throughout the way that our

572
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:16,360
team works it's just communication

573
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:18,649
really it's making sure that you know

574
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,908
people know whether each other stand and

575
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,070
what's being done and that everything's

576
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:23,360
just organized well and I think

577
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,490
especially with our company they were

578
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,949
looking for people that have them

579
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,139
organizational skills but still have a

580
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,299
bit of common sense sinking off and go

581
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:35,629
right up and as he was doing let's do

582
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,129
that that's kind of thing so have a

583
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:39,469
question for you can generally related

584
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:41,689
to this albeit so he moved from job to

585
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,000
job rather than night of university into

586
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,559
jobs it was a how did they how did your

587
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,240
previous one experience come into play

588
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,379
in the like interview process like

589
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,720
because she'd been through before did

590
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:53,658
you find second how much easier or like

591
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,179
how did wildly different okay feel

592
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:58,460
because I moved from part-time working

593
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:02,000
at KFC to full-time working as

594
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:05,929
friendship I was very lucky to have the

595
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,519
part-time work was at college because it

596
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:12,320
meant switching into the apprenticeship

597
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:15,559
I was switching from part-time learning

598
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,529
part-time working two part-time learning

599
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,970
part-time working and then as a going

600
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,850
through the stages of the apprenticeship

601
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,389
that was slowly being evolved into

602
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,668
full-time working and that was how I

603
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:31,668
didn't really struggle too much in

604
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:35,539
acclimatizing myself it was quite it was

605
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:38,330
a very nice process so I very much

606
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,129
recommend apprenticeships mm-hmm in

607
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:46,279
terms of this sport I first getting a

608
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:48,439
bit off the experience with it as even

609
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,930
with enterprises I found a lot of them

610
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,480
are a bit more informal nowadays

611
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:58,970
I've never experienced the long kind of

612
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,510
tear by tear by tear by tear company

613
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,310
because it's bends yeah yeah the other

614
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,110
company I applied to for internships

615
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,320
they had like a web app that you had to

616
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,820
do a test on as well and I think things

617
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,720
like that you know when you're sat and

618
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,580
you're actually getting an opportunity

619
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,320
to do practical skills a lot of

620
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,449
employers now I've seen my I think NCC

621
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,040
have been engineering and a few other

622
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,390
companies do it so that they're great as

623
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,879
well and I think you get a real sense

624
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,740
again for yourself am I gonna be a fit

625
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,270
here is this the kind of thing I want to

626
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,700
be doing and I think at the end of the

627
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,710
day with employers when it comes to like

628
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,300
looking for this first job there's two

629
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,860
approaches really you can go down you're

630
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,030
going like the Hail Mary attack we're

631
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,219
going for everyone we're just sending

632
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,960
out 50 million applications I mean that

633
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,700
will work you know if you send out a

634
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,860
load then you know you've bounced hear

635
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,510
back from a few but I think the approach

636
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,699
that I would always recommend is like

637
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,470
sit and look at the company you know

638
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,050
look at them on LinkedIn and YouTube

639
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,030
them and all this and really get to know

640
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,070
the people like that are involve like I

641
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,649
know with the company end up working for

642
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,060
you know I was searching I looked

643
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,620
through the employees and I was watching

644
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,450
they had some videos when YouTube and I

645
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,919
it was but making me smile and I was

646
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,990
like you know I love the look of this

647
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,970
company of the feel this is why I want

648
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,890
to work so then when I was writing my

649
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,870
emails and stuff they were targeted to

650
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,180
the company I was like you know I like

651
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,469
this I've seen this and I would love to

652
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,180
be involved it you know this is what I

653
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,220
can offer you kind of thing and I think

654
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,020
that really helps because when you're

655
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,150
establishing that connection with the

656
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,550
employer rather than going hey hire me

657
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,710
you're going hey so-and-so you know I've

658
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,870
seen this about you and I really want to

659
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,340
work your company on this because you

660
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,750
know then you're building it you're

661
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,750
building a relationship and I think

662
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,730
that's nice so you were saying yeah so

663
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,590
I'm it is important to remember that

664
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,100
this is just our experiences and there

665
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,050
are massive variety event a few

666
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,689
experiences everyone will have so I went

667
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,520
from Lou and someone if you got me an

668
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,010
interview I couldn't come down with no

669
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,960
which was a pretty standard process to

670
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,570
something very formal that has a lot of

671
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,020
aptitude tests with a larger company to

672
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,669
then review which wasn't really an

673
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,440
interview which was the job offer I got

674
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,780
immediately after a talk so

675
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,610
that I wasn't aware that wasn't

676
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,310
interview I didn't expect them to be an

677
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,709
interview but the person who offered me

678
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,030
the job for like an interview so there's

679
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,460
a whole lot of different energy

680
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,010
processes and why do it depends on the

681
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,050
company yeah I think what you've just

682
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,490
said there as well when you're in like

683
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,260
when you're at places like this it's

684
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,640
important you know there are people here

685
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,990
like and this isn't just like people

686
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,760
that are doing stands like you know

687
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,290
there are people that work for companies

688
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,730
so making them introductions and going

689
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,500
oh yeah you know I'm here I'm looking

690
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,290
for a placement I'm looking for a junior

691
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,670
in my graduate you know by standing and

692
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,470
talking to someone again it's like

693
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,750
memorable because you're having that

694
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,400
conversation and a lot other times I've

695
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,690
found like you know they'll go off you

696
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,160
know here's a card like send me an email

697
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,860
and you know because you've already had

698
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,800
that prior conversation it makes it more

699
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,540
personal born again and I think I quite

700
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,149
follow this because it's something I saw

701
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,670
the experience was it obvious to to you

702
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,650
what you should prepare the questions

703
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,030
written all is of course um was it

704
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,380
obvious to you how you should prepare

705
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,389
for the interview process that you would

706
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,220
that you went through like was the

707
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,600
company helpful and guidance and F not

708
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,820
high did you like tackle that problem

709
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,070
because it's quite a lot but you could

710
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,300
potentially they asked right so how did

711
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,470
you guys approach that I just start

712
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,270
preparing for the interview like this

713
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,640
checking me you've got a little bit sex

714
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,770
covered not something you absolutely

715
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,350
make sure you understand what type of an

716
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,520
is really going for I've spoken to

717
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,040
people in the past you think they're

718
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
prepared in the fairway car and soft

719
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,530
skills interview then they get on the

720
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,850
floor and find out it's a technical

721
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,340
interview and the talk we're unprepared

722
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,800
so first and foremost make sure you know

723
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,840
what type of interview preparing for and

724
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,580
prepare accordingly

725
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,110
past that if you know it's going to be a

726
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,020
tentacle what if you just make sure you

727
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,000
revise your just general technical

728
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,879
knowledge just make sure you understand

729
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,620
what you what expense i one thing i

730
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,570
thought i funk will helpful that friends

731
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,100
of my nephews there are question banks

732
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,100
available and i know that actually the

733
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,889
the armored kayakers has on their wiki a

734
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,230
list of them to be fashioned yeah so i

735
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,830
actually wrote that page and so on the

736
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,990
hikes on vacation there's a simple

737
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,178
there's a big list of common intentions

738
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,279
and it's not saying like use the type of

739
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,130
questions that X company will ask its

740
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,809
the more generic stuff that comes up all

741
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,169
the time with every employer so it's

742
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,899
stuff like what's the difference between

743
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:26,000
TCP and UDP what what is our how does

744
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:28,250
DNS work stuff like that it's it's the

745
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,990
common stuff but that's I've had people

746
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,059
gave me feedback to say that that's been

747
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,950
a really useful resource because they

748
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,980
are really really common questions I

749
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,840
would Segway as well coming back to the

750
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,549
university thing if you are at uni and

751
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,860
you're applying for these jobs I would

752
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,570
like put it out there now but a lot of

753
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,309
courses will not prepare that bit of

754
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,200
text that some companies expect I know

755
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,908
our university doesn't and something

756
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,820
what we're trying to help build like you

757
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:54,710
know but I would recommend is start

758
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,850
early like if you're in first year you

759
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,470
know it's first year

760
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,689
like you know do a bit of a flight your

761
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,399
own time read some books you know hack

762
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,330
some web apps you know it's all about

763
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:04,760
experience because if you're building

764
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,990
that knowledge base up early then when

765
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,940
it comes to the tech questions you won't

766
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,470
and start some be panicking I think as

767
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,610
you said earlier in regards University

768
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,659
it really is what you make it like it

769
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,269
yeah I think there's so much opportunity

770
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,529
to learn that like like to like totally

771
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:16,760
go to the classes I feel you're doing

772
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,320
yourself a disservice because when it

773
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,059
comes to something wasn't covered and

774
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,620
quite like a tight curriculum and you

775
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,658
might be like oh no what's this yeah I'm

776
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,518
finding yourself time it's like the only

777
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,440
time in your life as well that you have

778
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,360
that much time look like when you

779
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,429
actually get a job your time doesn't

780
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:39,019
exist here so you do it well you've got

781
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:40,820
it I know time is fleeting okay so did

782
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,820
you did you interview in long companies

783
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,260
so did you see a common I better get a

784
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,720
particular type of Adobe process that

785
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,919
you saw multiple this mean a lot of

786
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,419
people have been applying for jobs now

787
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,970
and so if they even if they knew what in

788
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:55,370
due process to expect those be so like

789
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,950
you said in regards to the previous

790
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,149
question it does a very massively

791
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,090
depending on the size of the company

792
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:04,189
obviously what Chloe's experiences quite

793
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,379
informal because it's a small company if

794
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,549
you deal with a bigger company it's

795
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,090
going to know priori different

796
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:12,139
experience from that as well like you

797
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,158
have to remember with corporate

798
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,959
companies because they're so large

799
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:16,580
they're probably getting in so many

800
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,529
Haitians so when you're going through

801
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,090
their like filtering it down you know

802
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,169
with each stage it's like refining and

803
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,820
refining our fighting words

804
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,640
I think smaller companies probably have

805
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,529
less you know heavy load of people like

806
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,330
there's probably no not as much in flux

807
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,070
so they've got a bit more time to have

808
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,408
the personal conversation but I think

809
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,850
you know look at yourself and kind of

810
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:37,159
think oh you know what kind of company

811
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,928
do you think I'm think I'm gonna fit in

812
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,419
you know if you're like a chatty

813
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,000
sociable you know chill person you might

814
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,350
want like a side face chatty kind of job

815
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,210
but you know if you're a very much like

816
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,740
you like your office maybe more

817
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,179
corporate I think you know it's you have

818
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,360
to think about the kind of person you

819
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:55,159
are

820
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,270
yeah sorry third Segway Jack Soloff the

821
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,190
spine so I actually played for a long

822
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,230
companies so what doesn't is if I could

823
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,690
get like 30 odd but they were only in

824
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,580
about similar vein to BT sure so they

825
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,020
all had a very similar process so

826
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,730
they're all very much graduate schemes

827
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,230
they will very much have this kind of

828
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,270
this kind of like waiting awful

829
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,890
filtering process to them and they were

830
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,418
all very similar so you don't you know

831
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,799
you always always have your soft skills

832
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,720
you know sorts have your tech skills

833
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,549
you don't always have like an assessment

834
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,840
center or a bunch of grads would meet

835
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,210
one day they need to go through

836
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,629
challenges and that seems to be a very

837
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,710
kind of by-the-book approach what was

838
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,370
the hardest part of that do you think

839
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,020
what I've been so I think you learn over

840
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,789
time how to approach them I think for

841
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,010
your first ever Assessment Center like

842
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,149
I've no idea what's happening why they

843
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,340
asking these questions they seem ready

844
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,719
Hoff but I think over time you'll go to

845
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,610
more assessment centers you'll kind of

846
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,990
see what they're looking for and

847
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,729
sometimes the company just won't be a

848
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,809
good fit but then sometimes you'll find

849
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,950
one like BT where it's really good I

850
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,990
guess they're the only solution that is

851
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,250
to keep applying and keeps him writing

852
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:04,159
and researching a company which is hard

853
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:06,799
for you right yeah cool so okay so kind

854
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,210
of I kind of got there was a question

855
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,899
buying in a bit early but what types of

856
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,270
questions did you encounter German TV so

857
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:15,770
I think if we started with technical

858
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,870
interviews like what kind of technical

859
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,120
knowledge were you guys assume to know

860
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,889
so like I think it would be helpful like

861
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,840
just like to say your role and then like

862
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,860
what kind of like that question is Kim

863
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,820
come on

864
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,379
sure so I'm a junior pen tester

865
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,790
they based on that then these are going

866
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,280
to be bad interview questions are going

867
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,629
to be fantastically it is not going to

868
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,610
be kind of like I know Esther awaited

869
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:42,460
questions as far as the actual technical

870
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,209
interview goes it can be anywhere from

871
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:50,540
like hacking a web app to hacking

872
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:54,110
infrastructure that can be weird kind of

873
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,840
puzzle with things like that you get the

874
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,060
more general knowledge technical

875
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:07,250
questions like I mentioned out over TCP

876
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:08,600
and UDP and DNS and all that stuff how

877
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,220
do you prepare for that so I go like

878
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,629
this I go like the testing for instance

879
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,300
the web app and infrastructure testing

880
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,950
there any resources there's a lots and

881
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,629
lots of resources for practice and so

882
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,370
for practice and whether parkin you've

883
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,260
got stuff like the damn phone or web app

884
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,030
from all wars for practice and

885
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,670
infrastructure you've got stuff like

886
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:28,700
half the box you can spin up your own

887
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:32,540
like Windows XP box and just try and

888
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:35,690
shower I have certainly the university

889
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,100
we've got a load of vulnerable the ends

890
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,900
that we've used for various coursework

891
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,600
so you can go back and practice on them

892
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,130
for the technical interviews there's a

893
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,340
whole world of resources on why you both

894
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:49,820
public and some private and mostly free

895
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,310
some paid but some resources chucking as

896
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,649
well immersive labs if for uni students

897
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,300
social you can get it free and yeah

898
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,180
that's really good because that's just

899
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,210
on line and there's no fact about so

900
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,710
that's that's nice yeah no I'm so that

901
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,270
was ready and any bit of technical

902
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,370
questions which time for you and your

903
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,250
advice was written in apprenticeships

904
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:12,169
committees not so much not so much they

905
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,360
punch it but talking about when I was

906
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,370
getting my actual roles it was more it

907
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,469
was always a scenario base the same as

908
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,610
that but there was also a more of mix of

909
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,210
the soft skills kind of questions

910
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,990
because of a lot of the work come be

911
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,470
Incident Response and deal with

912
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,340
high-stress situations so things are on

913
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,470
fire

914
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,070
something spread in it's costing the

915
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,410
company millions a minute and it's just

916
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:39,050
assessing things like will you keep a

917
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,000
level head during that will you panic we

918
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,169
just completely shut down who would you

919
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,210
talk to

920
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,330
even if you didn't know the information

921
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,890
are you just gonna flap in the moment or

922
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,169
you can actually turn to your colleague

923
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,850
and go help how do you prepare for that

924
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,930
and that's the nice thing because I know

925
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,429
I find that quite difficult I

926
00:32:53,930 --> 00:33:01,460
fortunately never had the scenario it is

927
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:03,950
difficult cause it is more of is more of

928
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,730
a split 50-50 so it's like the technical

929
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:10,070
side of knowing all the different core

930
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,050
aspects of information security that you

931
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,550
might know as a pen tester as well but

932
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,889
then you might have more specifics in

933
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,169
forensics looking at packet analysis

934
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,540
things like that monitoring looking at

935
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,190
alarms or what they mean are difficult

936
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,070
attacks things like that I can

937
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,020
understand and like the funny apples of

938
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,520
life and then how old that actually fits

939
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,960
in your day today and how you'd actually

940
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:34,970
deal with it and how you actually start

941
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,860
touching on things like risk it a bit

942
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,330
more governance e stuff just so you have

943
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,310
the awareness and how it fits into your

944
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,409
work and make sure you can actually work

945
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,990
with other people in the business a lot

946
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,530
of it is teamwork and getting things

947
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,130
fixed so just before we move on to the

948
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,129
next section

949
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,260
does anyone else because we are we will

950
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,030
need a few items relating to this part

951
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,710
of the other processes anyone else have

952
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:20,300
any questions related to like the

953
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:24,139
interview process or anything yeah it's

954
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,800
an XY cause I've um a nice study member

955
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:30,799
so I'm throwing I hope this one like

956
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,970
certainly some companies do pay to the

957
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,919
200 of you like certainly bigger

958
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,600
companies well we will offer to like

959
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,520
embrace your travel but although I

960
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,290
caveat for that it is and will be like

961
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,210
reimburse so you buy it and then they

962
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:46,009
will they will pay you back in some

963
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:47,600
cases in response to there are some

964
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,060
using Scotland but I think it's the

965
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,980
start the stylist industry is quite like

966
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,840
small like everyone knows each other so

967
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,670
like it goes a long way like I'm going

968
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,830
there are that coming up stubborn laws

969
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,560
do and like there are the there are

970
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,850
other mediums like around effin cities

971
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,320
in solid matter we're going to if you're

972
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,930
looking friend but don't want to be

973
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,580
unsafe and then did did anyone else

974
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:11,480
travel to interview you saw it as far as

975
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,610
reimbursement goes it doesn't hurt to

976
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,860
ask if you send the recruiter with HR

977
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,290
pass an email and say hey are you going

978
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,640
to cover travel they're not gonna be

979
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,680
offenders like it's not like it's coming

980
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,790
out of your paycheck it's coming out of

981
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,710
the company they're not gonna be

982
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,140
offended if you ask it would hurt to ask

983
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,710
I've danced then you may have to wait

984
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,109
for it

985
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,700
I had one employer offered to boot

986
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,950
fights for me why they would do it so I

987
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,580
wouldn't go if pocket one other company

988
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:39,890
asked me to pay then the reimbursed me

989
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,569
within like two weeks then there was an

990
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:50,000
our company are we in two months for my

991
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:51,620
expenses to come back yes with the

992
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,630
bigger companies most the big companies

993
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,520
will expect you lying there you're going

994
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,890
to expense to grow soon to be team

995
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,870
definitely affect rankings and other big

996
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,299
companies will expense your travel yeah

997
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,960
I will say smaller companies it is a lot

998
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,520
harder

999
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,900
I know it's my company there's certain

1000
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,390
things they'll cover they'll cover

1001
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,730
travel and stuff but you know

1002
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,900
accommodation and stuff yeah I think

1003
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,010
that's the thing like bigger companies

1004
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:19,370
are definitely a lot more money because

1005
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,230
they're bigger but I think what you've

1006
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,430
said you know ask because a lot of them

1007
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,780
you know at the end of the day if you're

1008
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,069
impressed the money you feel at the CV

1009
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,350
is impressed them enough that they want

1010
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,880
to see you then that you know you have

1011
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,069
to approach it like oh it's a positive

1012
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,500
thing so they want to invest in you

1013
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,630
almost I think something to remember is

1014
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,730
that like recruitment is expensive oh

1015
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,200
yeah like that they felt they're done

1016
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,060
candidates and they've paid you why did

1017
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,169
you do an interview if they're going to

1018
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,160
say oh no we're not going to cover your

1019
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:48,410
cost so it's like a some tough love like

1020
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,140
it like for the company any normal

1021
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,490
person I would also add to that what I

1022
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,290
said earlier like when you when you are

1023
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,790
applying if you're filtering it down and

1024
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,529
making sure the best is like you love

1025
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,820
the company first rather than get there

1026
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,680
and decide all you know this might not

1027
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,330
be the right fit if you spend that extra

1028
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,240
time that can be quite valuable

1029
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:07,630
okay any other questions is for Yvonne

1030
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,629
hi

1031
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:25,980
so the other junior my important didn't

1032
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,490
have any expectations we have

1033
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,960
certifications some employers your

1034
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,779
advancement depends on getting

1035
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,850
certifications so if you have them it

1036
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,180
might help you to advance quicker but

1037
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,110
there's certainly no expectations and

1038
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,990
certifications are expensive they're

1039
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:45,840
real expensive and even more so for a

1040
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:48,000
student yeah I would say I'm quite lucky

1041
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,240
on my internship my employer is actually

1042
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,950
paying three studio SCP so a lot of the

1043
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,569
time feeling like an internship or

1044
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,859
something you know you can kind of work

1045
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,120
it into the inch bingo oh you know I'm

1046
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,680
really interested and kind of getting

1047
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,509
these because once you've done it in one

1048
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,770
job you know then it's something that

1049
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,180
will stick with you for life kind of

1050
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,490
thing I don't think it's the be-all and

1051
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:13,620
end-all some certifications have more

1052
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:15,299
value than others yeah yeah so without

1053
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,549
going to specifics some will have more

1054
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,770
values and others but from my experience

1055
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,770
there was no expectations from an

1056
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:58,020
employer yeah yeah I definitely think

1057
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,180
it's it's a good purpose to start the

1058
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,320
fact that you're looking for like four

1059
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,180
ways to develop you're learning outside

1060
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,850
of university like that's essentially

1061
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,830
you don't need to like you need to spend

1062
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,900
money to they can do that you can prove

1063
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,430
that you're in chess and you're like

1064
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,780
wanting to that improve your knowledge

1065
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,609
with other ways like through your label

1066
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,140
the source

1067
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:16,788
like making it like a project yourself

1068
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,499
or eventually with some of the

1069
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,539
certifications there there's back is

1070
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:21,919
online so like even taking a stop with

1071
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:23,960
it without having access to materials

1072
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,210
and learning the kind of stuff that will

1073
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:30,799
be tested it certainly like I mean no

1074
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:33,680
one's gonna expect you to by the way

1075
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:35,960
that I've always prepared myself for

1076
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,999
technical you know moving into like a

1077
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,940
pen tester or which is what I do

1078
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:43,038
I've always do like VM so like one or

1079
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,440
more machines sit hack it right report

1080
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,210
and it's genuinely like if you can show

1081
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,980
a especially for a pen testing point of

1082
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,140
view a company that you can write a

1083
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,989
report that is invaluable so then like

1084
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,788
they'll love you so I'd build up like a

1085
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:57,289
little repertoire like if you don't do

1086
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,239
some vulnerable machines write up some

1087
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:00,769
reports and then kind of you could go oh

1088
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:02,299
I have this Pro X where it's saying with

1089
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:04,488
like half the box and stuff I think it

1090
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,930
tracks you and how much progress you're

1091
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,380
making see you know I've done these

1092
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,419
things

1093
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,130
zygarde this level yeah and I think

1094
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,989
that's helpful higher box is super

1095
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,180
valuable I used as a student and I still

1096
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:16,369
use it as a ground you valuable for a

1097
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:36,308
tester yep volleyball protester maybe

1098
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:38,329
not so much for an analyst position so

1099
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,710
the question was do you have any

1100
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:42,049
personal projects and where I'm already

1101
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,609
asked by them certainly is this really

1102
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:46,730
the big testing or is this just a

1103
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:49,098
general kind of I didn't have

1104
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:51,619
interpersonal projects really so I I

1105
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:53,900
discussed like how I did half the box to

1106
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:55,940
practice for training I discussed the

1107
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,960
conference's I'd attended and some talks

1108
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,730
that I would enjoy to certain

1109
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,099
conferences the speaking opportunities

1110
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:04,130
I've done the research projects I've

1111
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:06,499
done at university but I didn't really

1112
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,730
have any personal projects like

1113
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:12,140
development related and if that helps

1114
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,059
yeah obviously it depends on the person

1115
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,058
like I said I'm not big on development

1116
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:18,410
but if someone is more of a developer

1117
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:20,180
then great if you've got some cool

1118
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:23,950
projects I'm get Harvey in Freddy to

1119
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,950
open source stuff growing in

1120
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,680
so I should probably do the last section

1121
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,270
so after you get the job I'm not sure

1122
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,540
image in your possession it is quite

1123
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:36,820
like a sum of this time and my garnet is

1124
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,009
tuned so we did we did receive a few

1125
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,230
questions so how do you keep up with

1126
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:46,080
trends and new technologies now that

1127
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:49,180
you've secured a job - I put it I spend

1128
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:54,400
35 minutes on a tooth each way every day

1129
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:55,810
and I use that time to read and so I use

1130
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,420
that time to catch up on it'll set

1131
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:01,540
Twitter catch up on white just next

1132
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,460
second sysadmin subreddits how can use Y

1133
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,950
Combinator in full security magazine

1134
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,260
stuff like that I just used the time to

1135
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,330
read and all of that stuff is keeping up

1136
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:14,370
with the current affairs better than

1137
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,370
wasting and I really Alta to do nothing

1138
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,170
so I think answer this question is to be

1139
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,370
very different depending on where you

1140
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,290
are in your career right like if you're

1141
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,400
a career changer like the older you

1142
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,300
might have different responsibilities

1143
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,350
and I think then your time window yeah

1144
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,910
it's like I'm definitely flow people are

1145
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,920
just like University great and if you've

1146
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,540
got tons of spare time do these side

1147
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,390
projects you know I said write articles

1148
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,890
or write code whatever the fitment or

1149
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,600
you get on your career or whatever

1150
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,089
you're gonna get less of that full-time

1151
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:48,279
so if they use it what you can do you

1152
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:51,400
can do now you know in your spare time

1153
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,830
doing some you know PM's and stuff and

1154
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,440
also attending like meetups like I know

1155
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:58,720
there's a lot of Def Con groups and you

1156
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,730
know conferences and a lot of societies

1157
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,560
as well so if you can get involved that

1158
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,450
way you know you're not like stuck in an

1159
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,740
office or in your bedroom kind of away

1160
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,480
from the world it's you know it's just

1161
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,270
you know kind of getting out and doing

1162
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,820
the thing and I'm very often that I'm

1163
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:14,350
Jim's a good grip it makes a great point

1164
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,360
the way my parents implement people have

1165
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,250
necessary like last time than students

1166
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,770
unlike junior like professionals so you

1167
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,200
have all the time in the world so it's

1168
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,060
important to once you're in the job to

1169
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,259
like discuss with your employer your

1170
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,450
questions about them going forward

1171
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,980
because like you are resource to your

1172
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,450
company and they should be investing in

1173
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,610
that resource and that's not you being

1174
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,160
like gluttonous or greedy that's that's

1175
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,910
just normal employment so speaking to

1176
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,100
your boss about if you want

1177
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,750
if you want a kid like stamp with trans

1178
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,220
new technologies may go into conferences

1179
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,140
and you should ask them to like fun to

1180
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,720
trim 3 or you should see if you can at

1181
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,310
least like like this get the day like

1182
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm not a date offer they either or

1183
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,440
something like that like it like it

1184
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,300
definitely is something that's very

1185
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,340
possible I know a lot of companies do so

1186
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,500
as a junior do not be scared to ask for

1187
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:59,120
it if your company doesn't like a lot of

1188
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,220
companies also do research dates as well

1189
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,750
so they'll give you an allocated day we

1190
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,220
can kind of spend it learning and

1191
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,760
bettering your own skill set which on

1192
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,080
this a lot of test results or later than

1193
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,260
you can expect some time to just not be

1194
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,430
on site oh my god again it's if you are

1195
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,600
gonna have that conversation with your

1196
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,850
employer and just know like you know I

1197
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,650
want to be the best test or I can be for

1198
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,970
you or I'm gonna be the best in this job

1199
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,800
you know I'm really interested in this

1200
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,810
skill you know is there some allocated

1201
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,830
time that I can have to do that you know

1202
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,060
yeah yeah

1203
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:30,790
communicating is a big part of its

1204
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,990
earning anything awesome

1205
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,790
so a big one

1206
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:37,339
how did you find us how you're working

1207
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:39,470
full-time I'm supposed to good to know

1208
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,320
you have to do are you just kind of know

1209
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:45,830
I mean retracing what I said before is

1210
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:48,440
very much a gradual transition from

1211
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,420
splitting learning and working up and

1212
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,120
then slowly working my way over to do

1213
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,620
more and more work working full-time

1214
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,359
have you any advice for people who will

1215
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,569
be are building for the first time when

1216
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,070
they get a job I mean once what some

1217
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:07,850
pinpointed with the software Cyrano you

1218
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:10,460
know better spring seventy percent of

1219
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,860
the job isn't particular technical it's

1220
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,480
more knowing people in the company it's

1221
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,020
more knowing the right people and having

1222
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,860
to deal with them all that's mostly what

1223
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,030
I found

1224
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:26,090
well my time is client-facing so it's

1225
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:28,130
just knowing who to speak to where to

1226
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,810
get the fastest resolution on whatever

1227
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:35,060
the issue is still investigating

1228
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:37,130
properly and that's say 70% small 90%

1229
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,690
they're human organizations right like

1230
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,040
they're they're made up of other people

1231
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,040
so they got their people problems

1232
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,880
the transition from ego into full-time

1233
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,910
employment working 40 hours a week and

1234
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,950
on the wistful I reckon I've maybe did

1235
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,598
about 60

1236
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,520
we keep University my fighting over your

1237
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:56,890
dissertation and stuff like that

1238
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:05,829
so go into a full-time job which Alma

1239
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:08,259
had 40 hours a week I would like back to

1240
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,670
what I said earlier like communication

1241
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,799
with an employee is important I found

1242
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,390
like moving into my internship like some

1243
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:15,460
of it quite stressful because you know

1244
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,500
being thrown in pens I see like I had

1245
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,940
Auto pen test and you're sat in your

1246
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,069
learning but I think if you ask

1247
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,770
questions I mean I've made some really

1248
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:25,299
stupid mistakes I manage I think it was

1249
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,390
like my first couple of weeks I manage

1250
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:30,040
to delete - from Cali which is

1251
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,259
detrimental to Cali because you need

1252
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,630
Python for a lot of things and I was so

1253
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,849
scared to ask my employer I you know

1254
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,069
just it was so backwards and I think if

1255
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:40,270
you go oh I've done this thing or you

1256
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:42,040
know I've made this mistake can you help

1257
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,780
me fix it or you know I don't understand

1258
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,549
rather than you know sitting there and

1259
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,559
letting the problem build because I know

1260
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:49,450
for myself like I've spent many a night

1261
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,760
crying because I'm anxious and worried

1262
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,020
that actually you know employers you

1263
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,609
know they're nice people your teammates

1264
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,079
are nice people so ya know asking

1265
00:46:54,609 --> 00:46:58,058
questions knows it no one wants to make

1266
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:02,200
their colleagues like feel bad about

1267
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:03,640
something superb off that point just one

1268
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,680
piece of advice that would be described

1269
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,089
do something to support people so ever

1270
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,308
that's in your company or in the

1271
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:11,259
community just finding people that that

1272
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:13,950
care people that can help that's

1273
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,990
technical or on the soft out on Sunday

1274
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,160
and I think asking for mentorship as

1275
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,598
well like you know a lot of people on

1276
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,460
Twitter offer it out and why does anyone

1277
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,990
need help I'm good at this thing so you

1278
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,859
know putting out their big motto you

1279
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,328
know I'm really interested in learning

1280
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:27,848
how to do web app test so that you know

1281
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,819
talk to a pipe tester and you know get

1282
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:32,740
some help that way if you need support

1283
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:34,240
employers above all so depending on the

1284
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,000
employer offer mentorships giving as

1285
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,410
well so I've started her junior Pentax

1286
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,770
her but I'm quite keen to go down the

1287
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:45,399
red team route so I'm working with one

1288
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:47,290
of our good red teamers as as I kind of

1289
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,420
like he's like a mentor to kind of guide

1290
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:52,690
me down that path to becoming a

1291
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,069
readiness full-time okay on that point

1292
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,230
of kind of things that companies offer

1293
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:57,910
big companies as well as offer Mental

1294
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,799
Health First Aid so if you ever find

1295
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,690
yourself in that corner to do you have

1296
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:02,800
to talk to you that's what was a great

1297
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,410
vice and something

1298
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,700
actually having your company that I'm

1299
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,259
failing an employer is offered in the

1300
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,000
community as well so we now have mental

1301
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,890
health hackers which is now community

1302
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,800
I've been healthy status we've ran a

1303
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,120
workshop leads well so long ago and a

1304
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,790
bunch of us are on them at all those

1305
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,190
days as well I think so we're gonna sum

1306
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:26,650
this up as advice for people looking

1307
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:27,850
into the other second story so I got a

1308
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,140
call for action what is the most

1309
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,690
important thing that students nowadays

1310
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,770
should so I'd say that if you do have

1311
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,810
that dream job

1312
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,300
that's a gopher right if it is you're

1313
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,980
drinking eventually we'll have wherever

1314
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,350
not you have to take multiple stepping

1315
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:44,380
stone jobs to get one eventually you'll

1316
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,810
get and you'll be smart enough would be

1317
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,780
the best you can be great you just have

1318
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:56,650
to get I think you dig trying train

1319
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:58,810
never stop learning with network I think

1320
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,090
you know when you know all these people

1321
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,250
it just is invaluable to the grander

1322
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,460
scheme of everything like I've seen

1323
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,920
people get jobs on Twitter and I'm like

1324
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,150
and an important thing we thought is if

1325
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,590
you're finding a lot of people said when

1326
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,700
I say or not working really important

1327
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,650
they say like none of the opportunity to

1328
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,270
network and like it's not behind you to

1329
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,400
create those opportunities to network

1330
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,170
might find something which other people

1331
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,430
will be interested in and like make it

1332
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,750
public that you're working on there's

1333
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,940
not only as you discussed our new years

1334
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,380
of great for building like it like like

1335
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,090
like building your resume and also like

1336
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,650
well attract attention and people will

1337
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,920
be interesting what you say and not kind

1338
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:35,890
of these some more Virginia so yeah yeah

1339
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:52,660
cool well the fun you very much for a

1340
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:54,700
furnace in this we are we're looking to

1341
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:57,220
try and solve some of the problems and

1342
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,080
like juniors getting into the industry

1343
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,029
because a lot of it it's quite a thick

1344
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,960
and I law that's quite that's the scary

1345
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,970
time in our lives

1346
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,380
anyway I'm like it's certainly not made

1347
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:09,250
easier by the pressure just for them us

1348
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:12,990
by like by work so if you get us

1349
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,990
following Twitter or given if you

1350
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:34,060
[Music]

1351
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,390
through the whole process

1352
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:45,600
hiring people and seen table specs been

1353
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:47,549
done sure you realize that people do

1354
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,049
miss John specs are human asshole

1355
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,090
they sometimes don't know all the

1356
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,350
details so they yeah these buzzwords

1357
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,920
like Oh

1358
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:58,319
CSP and epic Ohioans are they put that

1359
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:06,950
in that's on this bear claw my advice is

1360
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:06,950
if you don't have it if you can do those

1361
00:51:15,170 --> 00:52:02,460
requirements on the job anyway how

1362
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,610
important I find it I I don't take CDs

1363
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,050
but I think it shows looking for a

1364
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:09,540
positive of it I think it's like showing

1365
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,670
previous work experience shows the match

1366
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,380
the job sort of thing and my respects

1367
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,850
it's good and then like in depending on

1368
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,640
the job site director instance bar staff

1369
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,500
work well show soft skills and so on and

1370
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,900
so forth so I think it should be thought

1371
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,010
of in the context those like the high

1372
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,040
desert Hudson

1373
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:31,140
in my application whether it's like wait

1374
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:34,680
one minute but did you guys pay your

1375
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:36,569
premium jobs like didn't know I tried to

1376
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,120
do Plan C CB thing

1377
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,740
make it cute alright mine's all over the

1378
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,660
place but instead I took out things like

1379
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,640
that and I did have a section for like

1380
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,270
skills and I try and include them

1381
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,910
elsewhere

1382
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:49,740
I mean I do think you know like more

1383
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,029
experience as you said like if you're

1384
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,439
putting something like that it's it's

1385
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,900
not gonna harm your application about

1386
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,420
that matter especially like first job

1387
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,590
kind of situation it's you know I would

1388
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,510
say it would probably be better to have

1389
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:01,890
that like if the battery on the

1390
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,440
experience you have been working might

1391
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,960
as well put it in like yeah like I let

1392
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,970
you have this action then annoy so for

1393
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,840
example like I think I pick my retail

1394
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:14,310
jobs that I had on my CV because it felt

1395
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,470
like I you said it shows people skills

1396
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,630
that show soft skills so if you can deal

1397
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,549
with the hard customer and retail it

1398
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,890
shows those scale was a semi transparent

1399
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:24,270
to deal with clients who maybe are a

1400
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,120
hundred percent Compton all the

1401
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:33,509
assignments shows people skills okay I

1402
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:36,799
think we're different regressions drop a

1403
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:39,949
so excited well bear on place

1404
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,949
