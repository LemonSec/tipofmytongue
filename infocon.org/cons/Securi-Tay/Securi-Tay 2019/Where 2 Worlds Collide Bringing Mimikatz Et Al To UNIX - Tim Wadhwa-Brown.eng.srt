1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,500
thanks very much could it offer to

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,570
everyone thanks it always was booked

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,799
this is some of that was good just

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,799
checking cool

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,020
okay so as introduced the pups this talk

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,230
is to discuss what happens when you

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,560
joined a fan ad the way how they use

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,220
network together so by way of an

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,900
introduction

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,080
I wrote this here they are explain Who I

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,180
am

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,730
final thought and then we'll break into

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,839
the actual technical detail so the teal

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,779
they are if she's researching progress

15
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:42,070
it's about a year in now but I'll still

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,420
what I care about it's different you can

17
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,519
find in the event as I keep on finding

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,659
new attack sizes I'd still find doing

19
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:51,998
them it's not a bad idea

20
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,789
well they clearly Amy plays a part net

21
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:57,429
this is about what the attack surface ad

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,289
George UNIX mistake looks like this is

23
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,659
how if you get a shell program not only

24
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,920
UNIX is still an enterprise network you

25
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,429
won't find that you actually have more

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,899
craters

27
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:12,310
use them so Who am I some Tim I have a

28
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:15,640
background working for financial

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,280
services organizations and for the last

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,939
15 years like I've been working in this

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,420
tank

32
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,880
use the word scram I spoke at a secure

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,180
table field I spent three years ago

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,009
looking up red tape and DevOps

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,000
well yeah I like podcasting or offensive

36
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,590
by nature that said the financial

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,079
services stuff was an operational right

38
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,270
I'm looking at security for a defensive

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,699
perspective and probably for the last

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,009
eight events or so I could focus impact

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,079
on the defensive side so one of the key

42
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,119
takeaways for this talk if you take

43
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,500
anything away is that there are

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,060
mitigations a lot of things you

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,539
shouldn't do in to defend your units

46
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,770
estates better and certainly some of the

47
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,869
stuff has been published on to the back

48
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,789
of this so far is very much geared at

49
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,570
how you how you protect yourself not

50
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:06,520
just how you attack so the plan for this

51
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,139
talk I'm going to give a little bit

52
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,299
background for those you that perhaps

53
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,940
haven't have any familiarity with what I

54
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,670
do is write look look I run through a

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,739
theory it's a possible attack

56
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,679
probably speaking wolof similar fact

57
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,569
turns on Windows AVG own systems are

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,209
very consumed designations and

59
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,738
recommendations a little bit but then

60
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,379
the response because the vendor response

61
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,840
it's been interesting or finally

62
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:34,040
reasonable conclusions probably a slight

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,859
change from the last time I presented

64
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,810
this the bonus material on this occasion

65
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:41,180
will be more detailed look at

66
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,950
recommendations and investigations I

67
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,079
switch it up a little bit for this

68
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,238
audience I understand a little more time

69
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,590
looking at how I came so far these other

70
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,329
both ways

71
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,010
how I came to find this weakness is that

72
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,859
all the factors of C just from doing

73
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,090
research and on the last time on what

74
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:57,889
you should do as a veteran or as an

75
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,049
enterprise is I think in an audience

76
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,030
like this there's a problem we'll be

77
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,909
more interested in breaking things than

78
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,109
the necessaries in defending that said

79
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:11,870
when you got into the real world I think

80
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:15,139
we need to say about both so the

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,209
background well I started doing

82
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,260
operational security on the UNIX estate

83
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,359
20 years ago

84
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,760
we were using Tivoli to essentially

85
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:26,650
manage flat tax files essential parts of

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,328
essential shadow etc security password

87
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,159
little fire to detect finally an

88
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:35,540
existent part we were simply managing

89
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,429
nice fire rather horrific enterprise

90
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,290
applications written by the likes of IBM

91
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,569
and you essentially modified those files

92
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,970
in real time actually made requests

93
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,358
probably your graphical user interfaces

94
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,790
as administrator these days a lot more

95
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,979
systems are looking to the ad joint I

96
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,569
had a conversation just this week I

97
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,720
think this equipment workers at the

98
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,369
moment are UK retailer

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,440
building up their cloud infrastructure

100
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,359
that it is yeah and they want this right

101
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,099
yeah what do we do about the UNIX boxes

102
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,109
we're going to have this cloud how do we

103
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,909
manage the identity on there we started

104
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,229
talking about well Haley is the right

105
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,519
way to go in the sense you have

106
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:13,190
centralized management you can applaud

107
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,389
the policies all that good stuff but

108
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,370
these are the things you need to think

109
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,450
about because maybe your university

110
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,390
administrators won't be familiar with

111
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,570
is very heretic so that's a little bit

112
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:30,539
about why let's look a specific

113
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:33,780
implementation so then tell this is what

114
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,120
we see a lot we see that possible my

115
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,099
hand'd was probably on something that's

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,240
called that directly Atlas was but is

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,940
actually something that Cisco use

118
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,650
internally for our network I'd say it's

119
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,590
an obvious place to start but there are

120
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:51,690
as a other implementations so why does

121
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:55,169
it all myself look at it from a

122
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,990
commercial standpoint we're expecting so

123
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,340
they push the ITM below were expected to

124
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,380
be able to tell our customers how secure

125
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,169
their networks which beta versus your

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,240
own networks from the perspective of the

127
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,160
team oil price in that's even more true

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,990
because we're directly out there

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,310
consulting to customers I mentioned

130
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,440
their customers doing this other stuff

131
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,670
yeah if I can't be sensible answers to

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,920
those questions when the password policy

133
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,480
directly it's not my shoes and then you

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,270
look at the bigger picture we protects a

135
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,610
local area networks so yeah I like bugs

136
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,710
the scale this is a bug that scales or

137
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,780
it's a weakness and scales to be

138
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:33,390
entirely fair face and vendors concerned

139
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:37,500
so I mentioned I've been talking a bit

140
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:40,289
more about how we went look at this the

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,820
approach was pre iterative I started out

142
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,550
by building out other environment I

143
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,030
could test against I could research that

144
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,180
I could evaluate specifically I saw that

145
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,369
with fit up I will say influences and

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,100
equivalent using red house open source

147
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,260
ad integration solution had a couple of

148
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,300
others but as I started building it out

149
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,580
then I start to think about the threat

150
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,930
level look like is that when I had some

151
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,240
understanding what would likely go

152
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,700
Gaylords assistance then I started

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,680
looking at what that meant as

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,770
implication so system somewhat worthy

155
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,790
attack service is a change locally on

156
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,510
reviews from the configuration files

157
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,090
around it

158
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,980
then landed on the idea that perhaps I

159
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,070
needed a fossilized components yet a

160
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,660
open source implementations are great or

161
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,890
certainly the closest implementations

162
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,510
you know they get very far

163
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,940
merely looking at it from the file

164
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,550
respective and looking at

165
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,580
racial perspective reverse engineering

166
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,020
because I'll talk about the facts that

167
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,430
this is something that's probably fairly

168
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,770
similar says the week this is your file

169
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,820
in Windows the cryptographic slightest

170
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,760
things look definitely similar than we

171
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,400
do to reverse engineer development more

172
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,900
fussing yeah you can see the pattern I

173
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,419
went through a palace and say it was

174
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,620
easier to follow this amount map so the

175
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,360
theory of what we were actually doing

176
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,760
those theory of what I was actually

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,370
doing was about exactly this so that's

178
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,280
what bread hats implementation sss d

179
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,170
looks like our typical unix similar

180
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,479
structures typically an exhibit of

181
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,490
judges the director so you've

182
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,950
essentially got small sent occasionally

183
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,780
identity you've got some policies and

184
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,080
essentially it's not dissimilar from the

185
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,059
bubbling will follow with most obviously

186
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,859
authority provides a little dns is also

187
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,470
provide me LDAP based on see the central

188
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,160
rather than the Kerberos SSD if you want

189
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,260
a normality

190
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,470
it's performing a similar role to else

191
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,180
else us our window system and it's

192
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,060
essentially some compactness and falsity

193
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,400
active directory making requests

194
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,890
invalidate users getting Kerberos

195
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,900
information back applying that to the

196
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,760
users profile and the system they've

197
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,140
logged into yada-yada-yada

198
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,490
you can see where the attack surface

199
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,219
more at this is there are some

200
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:54,230
differences so what do they attack

201
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,550
change looks like well I said I

202
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,320
installed in and I was going to do some

203
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,690
threatening so actually I will apply it

204
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,950
so it will did it properly

205
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,350
Cisco have a threatened or mental reason

206
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,330
certainly but I also use months of

207
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,860
stride methodology and like sort of

208
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,140
certain tools give myself so this is

209
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,460
like possibly share with other people

210
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,440
and essentially in the end loader

211
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,690
building out big spreadsheet a big big

212
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,280
spreadsheet as I went through issue of

213
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,840
civilly and every time I found something

214
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,760
long tended I have thought was kind of

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
interesting i maked night event to make

216
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,280
sure I went a little what other than

217
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,409
isn't don't what's and so it's the same

218
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,609
design problem and the spreadsheet at

219
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,040
some stage rather would be something I'd

220
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,350
like to share because I think as an

221
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,030
approach it's quite useful to show how

222
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,770
you go about doing this but I actually

223
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,390
think there are other implementations I

224
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,309
won't get a chance to look at it will be

225
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,838
quite quite cool to see all of the time

226
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,039
limitations get a similar level of

227
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,110
exposure

228
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,969
so VIN teller I said I threat model day

229
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,920
that's Francisco straight water tool on

230
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,690
each of those components has a set of

231
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,490
attributes that define a threat trap

232
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,730
models the attack services essentially

233
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,950
based we're broadly speaking just as on

234
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,030
Windows you have a user that comes in

235
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:05,510
over the network across a generic trust

236
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,339
line boundary in this case SSH windows

237
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,250
it'll probably be our DP SMB something

238
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,920
like that and then login and in the case

239
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:17,180
of Linux you'll appear through a process

240
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,530
that hosts a Pam library SSH and he

241
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,719
makes a library calls down into the

242
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,930
power infrastructure the power

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,940
infrastructure in the case of AD in the

244
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,469
case of business this isn't some talent

245
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,960
but also an SSD and the other

246
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,930
implementations typically use a UNIX

247
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,600
socket to call out to the host process

248
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,520
for the integration so I've been telling

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,890
you is feisty sss uses s SSD others we

250
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,740
use different process than video you get

251
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,220
that one that UNIX socket allows crown

252
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,020
to talk to it and of course fast service

253
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,320
component then does the integration

254
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,569
piece back into ad so in the case of an

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,920
authentication request it might make use

256
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:02,660
of all that it may make use of Kerberos

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,430
cached credentials is an interesting one

258
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,170
so mean by this is a bubble auditory

259
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,390
history of cache productions being a

260
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,949
source of weakness year he compromised

261
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,319
approach we don't know promoters you can

262
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,740
use either edge of those men absolutely

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,630
the same miss with faster with with SSS

264
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,570
date a lot of importations

265
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,010
in the case of Intel

266
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,060
yeah there's a whole bunch of things of

267
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,420
the file system which are quite

268
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,040
interesting clean the secret base base

269
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,099
allocation in the back sequel a database

270
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,890
that contains provisions of interest so

271
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,570
that's that's only speaking what it

272
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,900
looks like and like I said if you look

273
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,910
at it systemic most layers attack

274
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,290
surfaces have analogy for its limit

275
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,270
Windows or Linux

276
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,980
yeah you can you could take the same

277
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:51,460
approaches and of course other vendors

278
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,460
do exist

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,910
the reason it's interesting is because

280
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,430
on UNIX

281
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,319
we're probably 15-20 years behind the

282
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,060
times I say that somebody that spent

283
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,580
their entire life work with UNIX and try

284
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,849
to secure as a platform but we also need

285
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,950
20 years behind the times you IDs and

286
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,140
Yogi's are pretty much the young before

287
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,990
security barrier that really exists and

288
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,930
they people like to say that SELinux our

289
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,820
backup and such have improve sight in

290
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,290
the face a homely system you actually

291
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,390
see in the real ones that have been

292
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,329
effectively configured and deployed our

293
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,920
very best to likely to see if you're

294
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,130
likely to happen a state that I said to

295
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,360
you will on policy breaches it's very

296
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,220
rare that you'll happens slowly

297
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,990
enforcing because if you fully enforce

298
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,530
then you have a whole additional moment

299
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:44,150
overhead comparatively windows have

300
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,730
restricted accurate way from being paid

301
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:51,140
as come as a protection it has protected

302
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,140
users security groups that has TPM only

303
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,330
no surprises and morph as LS a

304
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,790
credential isolation so Windows 10 the

305
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,400
emphasized process the equivalent of a

306
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,980
State Department of s SSD is actually

307
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,030
virtualized away in a separate instances

308
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,880
the OS so you have a very final set of

309
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:14,300
API tools that you can leverage as a

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,520
normal user to talk to Alice asked to

311
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,140
make an authentication request or to or

312
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,240
some day to gain access to your taken

313
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:26,060
you really are quite limited so the full

314
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,090
question was what if I can get into UNIX

315
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,189
boxes what can I do and how do I

316
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,070
determine whether I can recycle any of

317
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,200
the ID infrastructure by getting in in a

318
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,170
huge array of tilting out there and in

319
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,970
fact I think it's fair to say there's no

320
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,339
useful tool amount there so from a

321
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,950
fantasy perspective there's a few five

322
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,230
abilities have been polished for someone

323
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,640
implementations X SSD in particular has

324
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,410
a bit of a checkered history around it's

325
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,260
like PC but there's not a huge amount

326
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,199
out there so the school crisis would

327
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,210
went a little bit like this people log

328
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,630
into UNIX boxes they submit their ID for

329
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,550
dentures

330
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,930
I think Isis they boxes are quite

331
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,790
interesting for our own sake

332
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,130
that's all the works at a sacrament

333
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,620
illustrator has interesting privileges

334
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,120
recycle effective just by logging in but

335
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,529
there's a hell of a lot of interesting

336
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,230
privileges they may have low network

337
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:17,899
yeah it's all about the system that is

338
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,160
used to for example host an application

339
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,959
and an application was developed

340
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,149
in-house does that mean attending have

341
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,160
access to their to their get rings so

342
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,350
their internal CIA LCD infrastructure

343
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,140
doesn't mean we get access to they might

344
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,850
not find out you know what I could

345
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,949
evolve their their colleagues and get

346
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,050
access the Louis is it's a whole raft of

347
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,730
different ways you can gain and most of

348
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,399
those people are in various actors at

349
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,050
windows of opportunities to attack with

350
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:48,589
from from the UNIX like that just just

351
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:52,399
as prevalent say some practicing plus

352
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:54,950
hacks so I've great wonderful saying X

353
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,830
SSD Intelli authentication services are

354
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,050
around the 80 integration president

355
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,089
three ways automatically color brush

356
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,430
I've called out something as well so

357
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,200
they can be seen as part of an ID

358
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,050
integration solution you will also see

359
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,020
them into isolation the canonical page

360
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,040
is probably something like a web app

361
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,420
Enterprise pencil web apples their

362
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,250
infrastructure and they like they gauge

363
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,050
you know we taught most of the issuer

364
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,029
accounts individually for this system

365
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,920
will perfect figure on that and what

366
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:25,959
does that mean

367
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:28,370
so Red Hat so so first a siphon source

368
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,300
potential attacks look like stealing her

369
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,709
she's from the files

370
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,209
stealing hashes of plaintext or memory

371
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,430
from a blue team perspective each

372
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,079
relatively well hardened I say that in

373
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,900
the sense that what compiler perspective

374
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,670
api's of ApS that are well used our

375
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,650
business degree of Kampala hardening

376
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,240
around fit the sack protection etcetera

377
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,410
ah

378
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,660
notable would have interesting it does

379
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:55,939
well as the root user others I

380
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,100
immediately it has a bit of actually

381
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,350
track records were my PC standpoint and

382
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,170
don't think there's any public pic2

383
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,700
around most of this but that cached

384
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,399
credentials well in the minimal

385
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,670
is actually relatively trivial to a

386
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,020
point you can probably look at the patch

387
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,250
that's available for absolutely

388
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,769
vulnerabilities and figure out the

389
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,929
trigger it and whilst you know

390
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,449
think that all UNIX boxes are a well

391
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:24,769
practical up to date that's not always

392
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:26,118
the case how about the public PhD for

393
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:30,050
that proved might happen at the SD that

394
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:31,399
works for them it's just as important

395
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,609
principle be able to be able to remember

396
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:40,610
the fact that the resultant work out so

397
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,749
it digest I set up an approach so that's

398
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,579
what the approach looks like with the

399
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:45,259
audit level what I really wanted to do

400
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,290
was understand what the attack surface

401
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:50,269
was that was introduced by the software

402
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,980
so I was looking at the file locations

403
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:56,149
the file permissions the contents of the

404
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,819
files processes sockets SDLC compliance

405
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,129
capacities the SSD slide I showed a

406
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,349
couple of slides back which useful to

407
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:06,199
know if vendors are probably things in a

408
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,749
safe fashion in telephone solution they

409
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,709
haven't been opposite the kitchen of

410
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:11,829
compiling that it was pretty much

411
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:15,290
compiled with spot DC settings from

412
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,878
probably 20 years ago probably part of

413
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,829
the reason I'd posit for that is the

414
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:23,059
fact that is available for a lot wider

415
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:26,739
so units is signed many of those

416
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:30,259
settings don't necessary have a direct

417
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,110
equivalence formula if you've got it my

418
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,850
ex temple - or a accessible one yet and

419
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,319
you're running us that's the idea

420
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,179
compiler you've probably thought might

421
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,729
have that emotional nature sets

422
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,929
sound probably the view also put the

423
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,629
something that compiled everywhere

424
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,920
didn't do too much work around improving

425
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,319
that make faster that it's and so you

426
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:55,490
end up with a situation where you're as

427
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:57,920
good as the worst case I want somebody

428
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,059
to review what it look like my review

429
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,819
what is understanding what the

430
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,649
difference between why this is still

431
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,240
like normally would look like so that

432
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:09,799
meant looking at the learn page little

433
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,569
bigger issues amongst tuning that loss

434
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,699
and I'm actual really helped in the case

435
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,678
of Intel as an example

436
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,539
didn't help from a security standpoint

437
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,039
in the sense we don't invent the product

438
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,569
and it will secure but when it didn't as

439
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,520
I have full access to certain as did I

440
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,049
can see traffic that was going there

441
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,029
that I really saw fit

442
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:27,408
you turned lot longer than my TV they

443
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:29,600
fill that sort of thing

444
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:33,970
great respond to it by positive cases

445
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:41,840
this has real-world valid protocol

446
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:44,570
limitations to work from so that's the

447
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,330
kind of artifacts you file your SSST

448
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,730
they range from - purchase through

449
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,259
porosity cases right down to

450
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,799
configuration files contain the

451
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,840
territory uses of information the bits

452
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,279
that are in italic you can't get to

453
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,999
unless you revisit the fairly common

454
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:07,279
with misconception is because that's no

455
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,440
different for Windows you can't you

456
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,299
can't accrue other peoples Kerberos

457
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,820
tickets or accrue other people's

458
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,980
password hashes or the Windows system of

459
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,840
market administrator relation rumor the

460
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,100
purposes this is this research wasn't

461
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,289
without the UNIX system that I have

462
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,639
access to it was to figure out how I eat

463
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,590
existed they're kind of tight on those

464
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:26,809
to the right of it look so the point is

465
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,939
if you get rid of a single development

466
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,350
instance of X AP does that mean you've

467
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,570
actually got a whole stack and

468
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,859
privileges that are associated with

469
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:42,049
other systems on the network that

470
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:43,850
problem the ultimately is contrasting as

471
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:47,059
I said in Tara's proprietor

472
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,949
multi-platform again you get Russia's

473
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,249
again you can still plantation that way

474
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,440
and even mess with the IPC

475
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:55,669
the IPC is more robust in a sense that

476
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
there's no public vulnerabilities

477
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,529
available for it on how the song

478
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,840
research that I did indicated probably

479
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,690
explorable conditions in the

480
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,059
implementation I wanna say probably I

481
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,950
worked with the vendor Levin I received

482
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,230
my first kite my first Katie's public

483
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm not suggesting that the referring

484
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,340
other places out there but when the

485
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,019
vendor has chosen to run more fast test

486
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,449
cases through their entire

487
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,570
infrastructure repeatedly to clean out

488
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,399
all the places and bottom problems

489
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,779
that's ultimately their decision they

490
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:30,139
were pretty good in my summer at God's

491
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:33,289
and instead they probably did by

492
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:35,899
comparison with SSST it runs as a daily

493
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:37,020
user but it doesn't work with you our D

494
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,300
0 means if you

495
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,070
code execution you attention to have the

496
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,080
ability to pivot back this is a very

497
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,750
user so the use case would be there

498
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,600
emerged it is something terrible VAR IPC

499
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,490
I can still potentially get massively on

500
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,199
as I said because he runs on lots of

501
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,480
platforms it doesn't have the same depth

502
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,900
of hardening panicles doesn't have any

503
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,570
direct integration SELinux didn't tell a

504
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,310
half fix that last point are in the

505
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,260
sense of the life provided messy linux

506
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,090
policy that's appropriate for it the end

507
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,740
of tiny basics in github it's all a

508
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,780
personal repaint that works for the

509
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,000
company and so therefore you only likely

510
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,080
to find it it's not actually asking them

511
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,790
and telling them that they don't have

512
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:22,320
one site attack so if they say

513
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,050
essentially we're clarity was david

514
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,820
morrissey site again with some connected

515
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,620
interest again we've got some

516
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,649
hesitations and configuration again with

517
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,719
light you see that my piece can't quite

518
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:37,050
interesting because it uses exposed to

519
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,970
Louise's there's a level of security

520
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,250
control that's applied to it in the

521
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,880
sense that essentially when you connect

522
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,770
to it you pass in a file descriptor the

523
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,120
Arthurian files is the Urd energy ideas

524
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:53,040
the process is the file descriptor will

525
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,929
selectively allow operations of the IPS

526
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,899
at sea level depending on the UID and

527
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,810
GID of the Cajun music ah that looks

528
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,290
pretty effective in a sense that we

529
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,940
reduce the attack surface total producer

530
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:08,040
this IV functions that were exposed it

531
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,800
would be of interest that we do reduce

532
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,510
access and then of course we have the

533
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,250
Kerberos tickets ah

534
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,650
just by way of its all the different

535
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,120
knowing about how those things don't

536
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,120
really know Akash flashes

537
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,450
anyone not like overseas I can say Cobra

538
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,870
sticking through my I'm essentially

539
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,820
holding on access to one system to my

540
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,129
density such that when you try access

541
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,210
sort of businesses workflow system and

542
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,950
you don't have to go through a full

543
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,810
version without a facial you essentially

544
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,020
numbers at total absolutely associative

545
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,909
that says the the ID infrastructures are

546
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,830
elevated the identity of issues on

547
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,230
please continue to trust as usual is

548
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,800
fashion so being out of steal the

549
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,290
Proform

550
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,909
music by daily privileges with

551
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:58,770
substantially which other assistant

552
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:03,810
assistant those the visa so that's been

553
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:05,790
telling held up again we can still

554
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,320
prevention summary that she really

555
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,770
shouldn't really do that used anymore

556
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,780
but it sometimes is the middle point

557
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,250
Scully quite entertaining the number of

558
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,290
times you'll see web applications that

559
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,460
have SSL Italy and in addition to the

560
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,770
interface on the on the user interface

561
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,570
for accessing and then you're gonna

562
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,190
figure a shoe that's used to do the

563
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,530
syndication checks to the funds that is

564
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,330
not SS over the way through so if you

565
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,160
into certainly outbound it outlines one

566
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,449
of her own October is there's a

567
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,410
reasonable chance you might catch those

568
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:37,980
critters in across the line in it in it

569
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:40,700
we usable form best mates describe it

570
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,370
and again as with every application

571
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:50,610
where this look to t4 injection you will

572
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:52,350
find additional essentially at the

573
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,629
fundamental level curve office isn't

574
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,459
unique so active directory sign

575
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,880
interpreter says the worst you may we'll

576
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:03,060
follow prospectors antisocial aspect if

577
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:09,210
you look slightly look this way they

578
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:12,389
can't actually do as I said you need to

579
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,220
be privileged to use it as I said these

580
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,500
attacks are pretty long known and

581
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,420
windows world but from my perspective I

582
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,790
want to see more likely the same thing

583
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,080
on UNIX captures plaintext and say he's

584
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,790
also created

585
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,439
find get any of those three things that

586
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:32,250
I can probably do things were intended

587
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,350
so happens if you fall around mimic

588
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,180
house on typical Windows box you're

589
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,300
likely to get caught by mg on you're

590
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,370
likely to get caught by Ivy do likely to

591
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,139
be put in some fashion or rather I can

592
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,199
indeed you're it introducing any baggage

593
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,270
the system in order to do it in the case

594
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,250
of UNIX

595
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,590
perhaps she's there found this the

596
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,020
tickets that class but in this

597
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,030
particular hashes and was interested in

598
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,980
so the year I detect the allowed to take

599
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,410
the hashes title of one to your heart's

600
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,020
content

601
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:06,050
anyway but that's not quite as easy as

602
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,000
it may seem we probably guys did a

603
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,830
little bit reversing set ultimate being

604
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,540
iterative at this point in time I was

605
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,399
not smart I realized that I needed to

606
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,070
put a pass on the one reason I was

607
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,420
looking at class they always know what

608
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,919
it was doing with my dessert with the

609
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,050
traffic adventures they received a lot

610
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,340
database I'll do that but you look at

611
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,780
the time when you're going lacks a lot

612
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,689
of plain text possible what is age

613
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,980
northern Indiana often lazy so there's a

614
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,600
little bit of adversity to do that

615
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,270
finding the functions

616
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,340
I will try still held trace of the next

617
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:37,610
race if you will not solve you this

618
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:41,720
intimately comfortable to wear on gdb I

619
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,409
da le Frank's an education really good

620
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,170
place to start

621
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,790
so ash trace will essentially consistent

622
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,880
definite visibility of what process is

623
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,159
doing and traced us inside the library

624
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,750
level so the way to think about it is L

625
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,660
traces essentially your deed literacy

626
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,000
your individual life was promised about

627
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,550
application and traces what the the

628
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,070
kernel is doing in your spaces as well

629
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:06,139
as my vehicles that you make an

630
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,850
ultimately if you will in particular

631
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,660
perspective of how their Gators is

632
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,629
easily

633
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,880
hoppers a great place to spot ID is I've

634
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,180
seen the reference group and excitement

635
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,540
releases more astounding but offer is

636
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,460
pretty cheap accessible unfunctional

637
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:27,379
certainly for them for the major powers

638
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:29,210
you know i us RS x windows linux you can

639
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,310
you're going to better get home peoples

640
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,430
of the way we're just so that's how to

641
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,860
look at that and for me I used to be my

642
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,870
nice guys with do more reversing Box

643
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,820
dumping a binary essentially having a

644
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,870
text file in associate that was facing

645
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,730
this X mob

646
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,649
the fact that my main interest which was

647
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,680
why he's the batsman so that that

648
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,300
something any way to do it he's his

649
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,950
talent but essentially but they didn't

650
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,340
just sit mr. hopper ever since there is

651
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,950
relatively cheap to get and it is a

652
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,399
greater perspective the difference

653
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:05,420
between the tape is flat was intended to

654
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,270
be wrong and bothering injures is meant

655
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:15,360
to be more forceful illnesses

656
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:18,418
so anyway breaking the hashes SSST

657
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,850
it's as simple as that so if you look in

658
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,110
the top left alone

659
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,240
right I'll hold it away a little bit

660
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,678
from the base base platform at first

661
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,110
base base is the same as soundless

662
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,380
essentially a standard implementation of

663
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:34,949
our authentication for their interests

664
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,530
and see 500 different ecosystems SSD a

665
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,059
zone they take when I said you can dump

666
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:45,840
them but they say there isn't honest

667
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:50,399
Explorer - Sean 512 can be be dumped

668
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,470
they're lying - cool that is John the

669
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,480
Ripper knows about that format so

670
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,919
relatively easy ash even with assuming

671
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,780
that you've got any passwords in there

672
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,190
you've got a good dictionary for this

673
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,690
philosophy again after there soon as I

674
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,059
tell her then tell them is a bit more

675
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,640
difficult so I mentioned I have a sequin

676
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,220
like database and I said mr. piss plane

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,320
crash miracles the good news is when I

678
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,570
started to dive into the language into

679
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,830
the binary Steve Harvey symbols go past

680
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,200
this point about they're not passing

681
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,939
while so practice as defending their

682
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,520
their intellectual property and

683
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,750
defending their their attack surface we

684
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,220
have sins which meant that I can start

685
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,650
to figure out what the risk by capturing

686
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,120
algorithms look like the legacy one I

687
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,179
never found it in the wall so I haven't

688
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,668
got a huge agree on it about sha-256 or

689
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,620
sha-1 depends whether the lease the

690
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:44,910
moment attained or whether he believes

691
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,409
the implementation is sha-256 is

692
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,150
possible to reverse that militant

693
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,130
reasoning the fact we've done that we

694
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,840
made the Taylor bubbles do that based

695
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,840
the German grip that stuff and so

696
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,260
there's stuff to do the extraction I in

697
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,820
terms of timelines

698
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,780
it didn't take a huge around the side

699
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:07,020
pretty much a day so what does it look

700
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:09,030
like so that's more or less the

701
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,549
implementations use that caching caches

702
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,910
for for bintang and it's essentially a

703
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:17,940
case of hash the Irrawaddy - the

704
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,970
password and then essentially you shall

705
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,659
back and then you base64 it and

706
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,059
the sequel of Davis's interestingly that

707
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:29,669
potential guys in both directions how

708
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,928
much you see were funded that depends on

709
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:32,669
whether you can find other ways of

710
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,429
getting to theta into the database

711
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,809
tables obviously the standard way is to

712
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:39,030
move in as a given user

713
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:42,299
and if fertile to find the most of the

714
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:44,639
IPC laughs to inject berries

715
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,750
hypothetically there maybe you could

716
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,640
like the hashes of the opposite

717
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:53,450
direction to maybe press so I taught

718
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,919
binary ninjas

719
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,480
don't bring the ability to annotate this

720
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,799
is probably the best way this one so

721
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,260
yeah and ask me essentially aliceparish

722
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,970
fighting SMB for using binary dinger

723
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,580
you'll see this essentially I've got a

724
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,159
fully functional groups and the perhaps

725
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:11,908
values has been passed in next to each

726
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,280
of the assembly instructions so that

727
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:17,760
gave me an understanding pit is actually

728
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,549
happening but it's not standard

729
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,960
implementation so I had to go and I have

730
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,789
to figure out how scheduled ready to

731
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,260
crack it

732
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,440
those rules are not a public remember

733
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,470
will then teach over it one of the

734
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,510
things at the end of this deck is a food

735
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,190
writer but how you stopped my potions

736
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,490
because they're not necessary as

737
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:41,010
transparent but from my height I don't

738
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,679
necessarily know why we're at guest

739
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,809
house when I was top pushes a good price

740
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,150
out there and silent designer if you get

741
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,100
to talk to is pretty helpful tape person

742
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,990
to the initiative notices we've got a

743
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,709
bit of the software the services we

744
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:59,130
defined will be you title within the 69

745
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,789
acres 69 already existed there's an

746
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:04,530
expression acid essentially my wife I

747
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:07,049
was telling anyone was calling it which

748
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,460
which function definition 69 so actually

749
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:11,780
uses its age and therefore through

750
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,580
usability relative efficacy absurd

751
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,320
e-tron chromatic values and definition

752
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,689
and then essentially you have some

753
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,200
definition it's also you have only if in

754
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,970
that 32 price which is a flagons in have

755
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,460
a lot of flight which is the news lonely

756
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,649
the saltiest waffles that essentially

757
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,009
says this is how I'm expecting to

758
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,969
construct the plaintext value for which

759
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,860
actions of Bill

760
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,629
I then define a couple of constants

761
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,610
that's because that's part of the

762
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:40,649
plaintext value design actions will - in

763
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,709
there and I said that the first of the

764
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:45,360
soul mates is 36 then on the right-hand

765
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,639
side you only have the function calls

766
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,199
that you are stronger it for when it's

767
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,939
taken a plain text item either for this

768
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,580
dictionary this brute force in a

769
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,070
location and applying basic solver so

770
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,129
you see it starts off like that so

771
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,600
clearly you your dear this instance

772
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:03,029
thing in front of the plane takes value

773
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,500
that's the key and then you do the

774
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,809
functionality plastic scribbler

775
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,269
operation and there's a test case that

776
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,009
was the most simply said that maintainer

777
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:14,909
career professionals were deliberately

778
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:17,759
ruleset geysell's environment that says

779
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:20,779
it bus is really actually still does so

780
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,990
they change the implementation of the

781
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:25,379
sha-256

782
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:32,970
crypt final operation we will know that

783
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:34,408
this is still pops and curtain aside if

784
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,720
intel is a bit more interest to your

785
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,149
terms of plain text every SSD I didn't

786
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,370
find anything particularly one Boeing

787
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:43,289
the case of in town on the service of

788
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,090
sponsors you doing that the plain text

789
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:47,009
values being left in referral parrots on

790
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:49,830
so essentially if you could dump the

791
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:51,779
vasty procession impossible to which

792
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,418
used to login or the password so the

793
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,639
easily locate turns out that's because

794
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,370
essentially the memory management

795
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,539
routine was set the thread only runs on

796
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,539
a certain conditions it's not

797
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,740
essentially continuously running thread

798
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:10,679
it happens when the entire thinks that a

799
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,629
user has successfully logged in because

800
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,370
he holds that password so that if you

801
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:16,889
need to do a password reset because

802
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,610
you're demanding and also possible to

803
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:20,039
subscribe

804
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,668
instant youth rather than the password

805
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,840
enabled and do that initially school

806
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:27,240
consequently we can get plant X values

807
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,139
out instead easy D chord appealing the

808
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,899
string which I've done so that's why

809
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:34,949
it's worth like because if we don't look

810
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,449
at those kinds of things

811
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:42,029
we'll miss Martin true that we

812
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:47,200
three thousand saya

813
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:49,240
thank you thank you so fun so if you

814
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,159
guys think it as essential as far as it

815
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,340
is on the TMP you should probably answer

816
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:57,220
your survey artifact is identity based

817
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,799
on a possible network variety of ways to

818
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,659
do that the most reliable I found was

819
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,149
SMB client a lot you sleep last

820
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:06,730
assignment notation a figure like we

821
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:08,739
working this as ideas restructure don't

822
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,090
base huddle think they actually

823
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,260
performed the first of all I will

824
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,110
attacks against them the cryptographic

825
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:17,950
weaknesses in in an active Irish in in

826
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:20,649
ntlm armed memory house works quite

827
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,510
nicely if you if you can take that the

828
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:24,549
sake you fall off the UNIX system of the

829
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,870
window system ukulele in the newest

830
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:32,559
processor useless listen to that like

831
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:34,389
SSH is kind of that so in principle if

832
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,918
you put a Kerberos ticket you can you

833
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:37,990
can look at all the human systems tape

834
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,850
using the paragraph taking the problem

835
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,220
is most of those live recitations notion

836
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,719
configure to use coalescence atoll which

837
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,370
actually makes the Russian why is that

838
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,799
why you've actually issued Kerberos

839
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,289
tickets why you ask you the authority

840
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,970
tiny seeds in issue you care what

841
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:53,860
stickers doing in ways because you're

842
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:56,710
never ever a useful tool under community

843
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,049
box which I only told you would ever use

844
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,730
them if you were either connected to all

845
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,799
the boxes that supported addresses age

846
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,279
the configuration is rarely switched on

847
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,159
or if you were connecting back to ntlm

848
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,960
kerberos enabled web applications

849
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,389
well the chances if you open up the

850
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,230
browser source at the option environment

851
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:20,169
is your face while sharks kind of quite

852
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,179
fun so if you get the tickets and you've

853
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:23,918
not the ability to be the traffic for

854
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,750
Wireshark folks if you agree on the

855
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,549
system and one thing you can send to

856
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,329
start decrypting traffic's that won't be

857
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,369
of interest you

858
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:31,690
the modern deeper deeper attractive

859
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,780
other system state

860
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:38,639
Hannibal's fact if you more options it's

861
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,669
a plus extra LEP

862
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,230
depending on which blocking and you read

863
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:46,540
RDP the sports curb or so it doesn't

864
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,199
some suggest it's associates just that

865
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,418
identify identification of

866
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,819
distant whoosh effective visible system

867
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:57,690
suggestion versus rooted for syndication

868
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:03,390
I've never been it working while I since

869
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:05,490
I might spend more time so Ross tickets

870
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:08,879
that's how easy it is to change identity

871
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:11,640
if you get on the ice so in this in the

872
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,290
left-hand side of I've logged on to see

873
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:19,049
that missionary so I've got a secret

874
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:21,690
registration and great right hand side

875
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,310
I've got very made it up through a

876
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,920
vulnerability in an application maybe

877
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,420
this because I have seen you access use

878
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,089
it whenever I've got I've got access

879
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,910
those properly so I've copied the the

880
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:35,670
administrators ticket I then become a

881
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,839
lot another privileged user so in this

882
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:43,859
case user lnx I don't have to set the

883
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,710
appropriate variable to the thinking

884
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:48,930
about just stolen and I want a list on

885
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,540
the Senate administrator so that means

886
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,730
that any whether that ticket like a DC

887
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,440
that ideas and Tatian trusts the

888
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,839
identity was because the services

889
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,440
reoccur was nothing silent into the

890
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,490
administrator

891
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:07,079
Atholton learn about to he explores so

892
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,180
the purpose and then it can manage to

893
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:14,099
recognize this and make it an effective

894
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:15,419
tool from a tax perspective on what it

895
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,180
essentially does is harvest those

896
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,430
different credential sources so harvests

897
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,089
leave the hashes it has harvested a case

898
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:25,279
it halts the plaintext memory and

899
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:28,230
essentially means that you end up with

900
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,589
something that you want take 15-20

901
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,810
minutes to do otherwise taking two or

902
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,310
three minutes I'm potentially being

903
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,440
something you could do is if you don't

904
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:43,500
have a full shell addiction to it so

905
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:45,270
this is a new tact I didn't really want

906
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,490
to stop there because that only works if

907
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,619
you put a shell of some description and

908
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:53,609
it was slightly work to see if we did

909
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:57,390
get because they show us what executed

910
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:59,940
later run lots of times when we break

911
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,140
into UNIX systems or systems in general

912
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,690
we actually end up with probably a

913
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,460
message for that

914
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,270
so I figured as Carlos sá presider's

915
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,580
then I thought you know I've written

916
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,009
I've written that reverse-engineer the

917
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,770
price goes up reverse-engineer the

918
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,660
hashes would because to like those

919
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,730
publicly available so if people dump the

920
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,440
hashes then I ask use them so the

921
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,020
written rules are so valuable now

922
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,430
thought you know what I'm not just going

923
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,110
to put this out on a sign up it gets

924
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,270
give you these guys a chance to defend

925
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,610
themselves so other people's

926
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,950
instabilities defend against this

927
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,260
ability or even to detect this will

928
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,970
really happen I mean I thought wow I

929
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,910
probably meant putting out the research

930
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:44,370
notes and fathers and said track and we

931
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:48,299
are currently getting there so that's

932
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:50,990
the real face of data that's what it

933
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,030
currently contains a step up from that

934
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:56,700
the mythical framework stuff is going

935
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,670
through the whole process to go into

936
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,830
this world the big sticking point at the

937
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,470
moment is the best most beautiful idea

938
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,990
environment that they can reliably test

939
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,450
the mentors I've written and I cut I

940
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:11,339
said I've done one work of others in

941
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,049
celebration don't really want to spend

942
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,070
my summer administrative messes was that

943
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,410
good bad really

944
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,030
um so then they're busy building some

945
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,589
test cases so that they can they can

946
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,500
reliably test this and then it would be

947
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,210
a mess but my month all your doctor was

948
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,910
a nice little 2d stuff it's probably

949
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:31,140
easy to look at from a wider perspective

950
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,759
I can see remnants of those positions in

951
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,069
the partial attacks out before we came

952
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,610
but actually if you administer a UNIX

953
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,140
box

954
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,170
and you know where your crouches alone

955
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,529
needs to look like no matter what the

956
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,530
deal was

957
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:48,510
and the patron of tools very little star

958
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,790
attraction constrain some of them this

959
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,660
ones I've been working on I will discuss

960
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,560
that a little bit

961
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,870
so what the mitigations look like so

962
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,820
you've got generic hardening you've got

963
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,880
the restriction of UID 0 and that we

964
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,560
will you can you can log out and P trace

965
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,200
a number of different ways you can do

966
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,600
that you can protect the resources with

967
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,189
selinux and you can apply additional

968
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,410
asleep read the manual

969
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,310
I sent through some finest material each

970
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,859
of us has a slightly sign

971
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,660
by this by this section of the day but

972
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,690
instead of that let's move on to

973
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:26,980
recommendations or I'll show you why

974
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:28,810
so recommendations this is the

975
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:32,230
developers as much as anything please

976
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:34,360
hold me up wineries permissions for the

977
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,340
most part permissions all the stuff I

978
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,950
was looking at was pretty good but my

979
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,220
IPC interfaces so they really need every

980
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,810
user to care to have access to them and

981
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,220
to they necessarily need people have

982
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,580
access to increase in Essex price

983
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,649
through the memory management funds even

984
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:54,390
the faculty practice and prices actually

985
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,620
might be interesting with furthest to do

986
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,990
make sure we know memory management

987
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:02,650
share hot if you live I see a hunt and

988
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,750
cryptography ah the VIN teller cars were

989
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,140
really good survival he ripped out that

990
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:11,170
passion implementations I reversed my

991
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:14,440
stick with the Shelf be pitch solution

992
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:17,050
ah but if you're gonna choose a solution

993
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,630
to store sensitive information use the

994
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,160
right solution for the job strange man

995
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,140
carrot with reason why in this

996
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:29,649
validation k the errors or something

997
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:31,390
like that into the polymer girth so I

998
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:35,080
speak the responses Mashable thin

999
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,819
talented ironically by the time they

1000
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,920
sent me their IPC failure I've already

1001
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,670
figured out that I was black isn't

1002
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,080
making things do all of them today but I

1003
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,310
actually shared their internal SD

1004
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,900
Congress that's pretty sweet

1005
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,299
there's very few vendors out there that

1006
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,100
guys are fought in extending an olive

1007
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,410
branch with a security researcher comes

1008
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,470
and says Harold's focus was what you've

1009
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,259
been doing thinking thank you and come

1010
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:02,319
listen to how she ran for their cash

1011
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,570
infrastructure ah they acknowledge the

1012
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,280
fact that plaintext memory was a problem

1013
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:10,690
I've been working on that let me assume

1014
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,940
that the native fashion their view is

1015
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,440
essentially that the the memory would

1016
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,960
only get cleared

1017
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,670
waiting or freight my life acknowledges

1018
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,640
some other certain additions that wasn't

1019
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,320
things that I gave actually and they

1020
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,430
pointed me their SELinux policies I

1021
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,620
wonder how many vendors out there

1022
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,669
couldn't even tell you about Nestle in

1023
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,830
default and I like

1024
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,870
right the very stuff in fact it wasn't

1025
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:40,620
easy to fun but however these written

1026
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:43,120
one all the vendors have been reasonable

1027
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:47,920
when I write this deck before Christmas

1028
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:51,520
they've had no issue for toddlers 30 40

1029
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,710
days I didn't feel sad to mention how

1030
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,660
she heard very much for since Christmas

1031
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,010
so they're like it may well be that I

1032
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,009
might be slightly more critical if

1033
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,600
everyone missed it but for the most part

1034
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,330
they've acknowledged the problem it's

1035
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:09,540
it's one much I think of education as is

1036
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:11,620
necessary of the implementations you've

1037
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,610
husband has the people that are writing

1038
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:18,870
the entire excess SD ultimately hole due

1039
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,460
to the architectures is given to you I

1040
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:24,250
talked about family knows it mostly

1041
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,030
shrines to harden their one to make it

1042
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,620
far harder for you to attack else us

1043
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,140
realistically no ticket about those

1044
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,540
kinds of changes other than Scoble hugs

1045
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,710
the fact that was a pirate little

1046
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,540
station one hat was a lot of the other

1047
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,570
vendors was later say well actually do

1048
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,830
think we can do similar things to what

1049
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,170
whatever windows I said or Mishnah

1050
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:47,110
Stickley yet if you could if you could

1051
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,710
influence curb design not not likely to

1052
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,710
happen unfortunately

1053
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:59,049
so I conclusions we learn what are the

1054
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,100
next steps will thanks and the next day

1055
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,630
to me I think is kind of quite

1056
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:07,839
interesting if you might apply all over

1057
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:09,520
home at least say what we learn if you

1058
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,200
get onto a UNIX box the might be ways

1059
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,600
for you to get access directed direction

1060
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,580
it well hospitals and hatchets need to

1061
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,900
be protected wherever their stores more

1062
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,630
just in the places that people are

1063
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,240
versatile us ah a lot of noise trance

1064
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,860
relationships just because the UNIX part

1065
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,660
doesn't necessarily understands

1066
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,150
active very doesn't make it any more

1067
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,129
forgiving when they ventured under the

1068
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:33,220
breach I'm probably at some stage rather

1069
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,200
wondering yeah I seen say the rest box

1070
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,779
is being used as words pivot internet

1071
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,460
works so it's not beyond the realms

1072
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:44,480
possibilities and Linux box will be

1073
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,630
um if you're going to use Active

1074
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,520
Directory please read the manual please

1075
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,930
understand what your switchable they're

1076
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,790
catching attaches is a good example

1077
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,270
windows allows you to turn it off

1078
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:59,750
actually say that the vendors of SSD

1079
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:05,810
that Nutella pasty it's just not the

1080
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:08,060
default next step I kind of want to keep

1081
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,600
from kicking the IPC is I'm pretty sure

1082
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,310
this winter's do pulses about it really

1083
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,549
people the trunk continue working with

1084
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,560
the vendors and I'd like to do some

1085
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,660
focus research with these other things

1086
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,710
because they commissioned the very start

1087
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,420
of CID fiber if your policy to eat it

1088
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,070
focuses you go be doing a series on

1089
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,300
whether the orchestration our

1090
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,070
illustrations will necessarily be

1091
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,460
something that we should have some fun

1092
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:37,580
with improving the best server to high

1093
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,560
civilization modules that's improvement

1094
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,960
pointers it's really shocking that

1095
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,140
meterpreter mm how include mechanisms

1096
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,880
the pumpkin process memory the Linux

1097
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,540
UNIX infrastructure if you want a song

1098
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,520
on projects

1099
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,890
attentive messes for a day their solar

1100
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,200
pipe this year but if you want some

1101
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,879
apology if you all that project you want

1102
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,339
some hair to do it easily switch it

1103
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:03,890
board that would be a really sleek ultra

1104
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:06,590
patient in their voice not as far as

1105
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:10,279
next steps if you do fancy pile Intelli

1106
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:13,220
or SSS be I'm gradually started bionic

1107
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,050
eye toward only to do that ah DX softly

1108
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,730
sort of things those pieces of the

1109
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,250
publicly available that happen from

1110
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:22,940
available for a while use sonic scare

1111
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:26,540
that's okay but they didn't work

1112
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,760
particularly well for this so you end up

1113
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,200
developing stuff safe at the entire

1114
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,560
there's a whole bunch of fossils that

1115
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,390
saving science they get hot rate like

1116
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,090
suggest that he found something they

1117
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,589
might be a good place to start

1118
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:44,240
broadly speaking the appreciate it was

1119
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:46,610
to pump out the IPC practice from what

1120
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,359
we see by mail in the locking and then

1121
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:51,360
use that to craft a course of messages

1122
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,690
and then

1123
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,580
is secret so friendly they dip like

1124
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,290
those messages and how many of you we

1125
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,410
have a tiny bit of an associate is bum

1126
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:04,470
foster 13 which is essentially for a

1127
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,960
random percentage of of whites you

1128
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,600
change that by by a particular operation

1129
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,370
in my case I think I'll go fax or an

1130
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,230
essential mineral packets that are

1131
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,660
largely comply with the original

1132
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,180
specification by have some minor tweaks

1133
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,430
and I just read about the blackest or

1134
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:29,490
crashed and things they crash and other

1135
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:31,620
things did happen isn't very fun so

1136
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,770
broader point perhaps if you're gonna

1137
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,240
fluff stuff term I think really does

1138
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,690
help you figure out what's actually I

1139
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:42,000
don't if you can try to like a text on

1140
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,980
filter for the phrase publish it of your

1141
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,250
faucet great place to start

1142
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:51,030
simply if you're lazy and Charlie

1143
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:53,640
Melancon approach yeah I hope does a

1144
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,890
wonderful job but you really don't need

1145
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,500
to do the develop machine the shading

1146
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:05,009
that has been done in some cases to get

1147
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:06,480
over results that's commonly output from

1148
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,340
the development side of things so

1149
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,350
license if you are they to get involved

1150
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,900
go to the under 30 would to start

1151
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:14,970
looking at thanks

1152
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,340
just a few of the people that help this

1153
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:20,370
research silent design most probably a

1154
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:23,640
good place to start without him John

1155
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,900
would exist as a project many of things

1156
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,259
