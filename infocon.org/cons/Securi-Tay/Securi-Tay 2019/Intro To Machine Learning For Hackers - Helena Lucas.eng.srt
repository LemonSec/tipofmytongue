1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:10,840
so hello my name is Helena and I will

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,518
not do many interruptions like so I do

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,440
cyber security and forensics at

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,470
Edinburgh Napier University I am

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,470
currently doing my well pop of my third

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,770
year in a financial institution during

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:29,109
placement I'm going to tell you they are

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:32,800
often no I used to be part of the any

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:37,630
SEC committee any second is the rival to

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:44,110
average a hackers over nature you should

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:46,180
join I also do magic tricks and I am a

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,870
TEDx organizer very happy to talk about

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,550
either of those things after the talk

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,440
the only reason that I'm doing this talk

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,989
is because I want to get more Twitter

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,050
followers than my dad and currently

17
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:03,459
about 450 people off so if you can

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,429
please follow me there that's me please

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:11,229
I really really need it like my I

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:13,420
thought about going on alright so a

21
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:16,390
short disclaimer and I will take my card

22
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,640
south I am woefully under qualified to

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,040
get this hope I have not done machine

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,170
learning in an academic environment ever

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,280
and I didn't think I ever level unless I

26
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,560
do a masters which is possible I did

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,540
machine learning for the first time as a

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,360
project network it was given to me and

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,030
this tool aims to be the talk that I

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,700
wish I had seen before I actually start

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,380
to project because I found it was a

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,009
little bit of an uphill struggle

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,810
especially at the start if you have done

34
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,909
machine learning at work or university

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,920
go away you're not going to learn

36
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:54,130
anything here this is very much an

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,640
introduction you might see a whole

38
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,420
satara sniffs but that's basically all

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,780
you're gonna learn so yeah I won't feel

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,310
offended if you do get up and leave so

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,459
[Music]

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,830
oh right yes so this is a Twitter poll I

43
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:15,340
got is anybody that voted in this

44
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,830
Twitter poll here like Ford

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,750
okay well I guess so this is your hope

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,280
so we're gonna do an interactive magic

47
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,280
trick I need a volunteer

48
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:39,390
okey what's your name meat let the

49
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,850
mortgagor done it doesn't matter

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,850
everybody's gonna do the trick anyways

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,190
right so what I would you to do is to

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,000
put your hands up with this in front of

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,160
you

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,900
brilliant and now I would like everybody

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,859
else in the room to do exactly the same

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,319
as chump

57
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,790
if anybody isn't doing it you can put

58
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,380
down your coat it's fine this one never

59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,739
mind oh I'm sorry you're really injured

60
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,739
okay

61
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:30,620
if you're injured please don't do this

62
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:33,660
coking this unlike this and a line go

63
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,450
okay so now when I count to three what I

64
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,609
want you to do is to go off right but

65
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:45,660
hoping will take not to plus me

66
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:48,450
yes exactly okay so one two three

67
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:53,480
and everybody's poking each other right

68
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,480
and now magics gonna begin abracadabra

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:12,900
right so onto the boring stuff oh no no

70
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:17,570
we're good okay so what is machine

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:23,010
learning machine learning is a subset

72
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,440
keep trying I'll teach you later machine

73
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,980
learning is a subset of AI but those

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,770
algorithms that allow computers to learn

75
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,830
to perform tasks from day tens of being

76
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,870
explicitly programmed to do things so

77
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,580
the reason that I've put these things

78
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,700
out this because a they're pretty funny

79
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,830
in my opinion but also the most common

80
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,570
kind of trend that I've noticed in terms

81
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,280
of security people is a lack of

82
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,890
understanding about the difference

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,510
between what a if statement is or a lot

84
00:04:49,890 --> 00:05:00,300
of misstatements and an actual machine

85
00:04:51,510 --> 00:05:03,960
learning algorithm so um the difference

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:09,419
is that while if-else statements are

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,219
very good at dealing with with sorry

88
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,250
with data that doesn't change machine

89
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,220
learning is very good at acting in

90
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,320
stochastic or randomized environments so

91
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,330
it's very good at taking new data and

92
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,820
figuring out what to do is that even if

93
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,200
it hasn't seen it before so let's take

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,840
an example of a dump

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,669
great if we've got an if-else statement

96
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,599
that is trying to see if something is ID

97
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,869
or not maybe it's

98
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,339
to have a question about how many likes

99
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:40,689
the doll counts right

100
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:43,809
so if dog has four legs then don't but

101
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:46,659
what if the dog had a car accident and

102
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:48,639
has only three legs so the default

103
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,319
statement is going to fail at that point

104
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,969
unless it's a little bit of a smart one

105
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,099
none has seen this kind of dog before

106
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:58,719
and a developer has gone in and changed

107
00:05:54,099 --> 00:06:01,800
to change the algorithm to a purses

108
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:05,439
cabinet but a machine learning algorithm

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,839
because of how similar this dog is to

110
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,289
other dolls or because of other features

111
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,559
of the dog like its fur or you know

112
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:18,490
velocity of zoomies and things like that

113
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:21,819
thank you for laughing it's going to be

114
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,649
able to classify this dog has a dog even

115
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,819
though it doesn't fulfill the exact

116
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,330
criteria of a dog that it seemed before

117
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,330
the slicker

118
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:37,808
so um one question that I've heard a lot

119
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:42,610
as well is what is AI what is machine

120
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:44,409
learning how many different so um you

121
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,149
might not see at the back so I will do

122
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,879
the terrible thing at breathing outsides

123
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,909
artificial intelligence is a program

124
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,709
that can sense reason act and adapt

125
00:06:50,909 --> 00:07:01,449
while machine learning is an application

126
00:06:53,709 --> 00:07:03,789
of AI so one thing that we need to

127
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,649
understand when we're talking about

128
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,779
machine learning it's the difference

129
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,599
between deep and shallow learning as

130
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,990
well so deep learning is a little bit

131
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,490
out of scope for this talk today because

132
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,979
we wouldn't thirty minutes and I

133
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,269
completely don't understand

134
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:24,849
but essentially deep learning is good at

135
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:27,009
figuring out what features to select on

136
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,919
its own whenever it's trying to

137
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,619
determine for example a classification

138
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,378
of a certain object while shallow

139
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:38,409
learning needs experts like security

140
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:41,079
professionals like all of us to explain

141
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:42,998
to the algorithm which features of a

142
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,169
certain object are going to be important

143
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,610
when we're going to try and determine

144
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:52,090
will anything

145
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:55,840
it's um yeah everyone is going to use a

146
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,359
more accurate representation of machine

147
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,469
learning and AI and this whole ecosystem

148
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,840
of trying to use applied this area of

149
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,930
knowledge to security this is more what

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,549
this is what it would look like but we

151
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,569
don't have to worry about that this is a

152
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,990
short talk so my friend Gordon who is

153
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:19,419
somewhere in here I hope oh hi on a

154
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,819
drunken night out before I had ever

155
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,599
touched machine learning at an any sec

156
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:27,969
social which is great he said something

157
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,560
along the lines of this which I will

158
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,419
read out for the people at the back I

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,399
don't understand unsupervised machine

160
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,689
learning can he just can't you just use

161
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,339
the supervisor that supervised a

162
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,729
supervised machine learning to supervise

163
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:43,630
the unsupervised machine learning the

164
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:45,550
answer to that is no but let me explain

165
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,019
a little bit more so it's kind of the

166
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,930
wrong question to ask in the first place

167
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:52,899
because supervised learning requires

168
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,689
training on a large labeled data set so

169
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,600
what you're doing is you are feeding the

170
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,610
machine learning algorithm data where it

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,079
will have some kind of way of verifying

172
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,850
at the end if it's making the right

173
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,010
choices or not

174
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,870
now the issue with supervised learning

175
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,550
is that you need to have a labelled data

176
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,649
set and these are actually pretty hard

177
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,670
to come by especially in computer

178
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:18,010
security there are and I will touch on

179
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,870
this a little later as well but the most

180
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,510
popular machine learning data sets for

181
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,930
example detecting malicious network

182
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,990
connections are from like 1998 that's

183
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,239
pretty old at the moment so we do have a

184
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:36,970
significant black of labeled dates which

185
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,440
is why um a more common use case well

186
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,269
actually I don't know the statistics

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,850
that might not be more common but a

188
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:45,100
common use case is unsupervised machine

189
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,230
learning which does not require labeled

190
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,279
HR at a higher level what an

191
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,110
unsupervised machine learning algorithms

192
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,360
do is it will look at the similarities

193
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,899
and similarities and dissimilarities

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,760
between different data points and it

195
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:05,680
will group them together based on that

196
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:08,350
so if it's got a red cap and a green cap

197
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,479
it might put them separately but if it's

198
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,260
got an orange cat in might get near to

199
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,300
the red cap because it's fairly someone

200
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,100
um but one thing I should probably

201
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:23,050
mention here is that supervised learning

202
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,940
is usually easily has two categories one

203
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,029
of which is classification and one of

204
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,190
them is regression classification is

205
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,610
trying to determine if something is for

206
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,930
example red or blue and regression is

207
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,560
trying to predict some kind of

208
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,870
continuous or a numeric variable while

209
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,910
unsupervised learning is going to be

210
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,880
devided usually up until clustering or

211
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,620
Association clustering being looking for

212
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,910
inherit groups in the data so for

213
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,980
example dogs cats an association being

214
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,319
trying to look for rule surf horizontal

215
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,320
people that click on X will also do what

216
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:05,260
it's really warning here

217
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,359
right I know this looks scary don't

218
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,160
worry I want to point able to this

219
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,420
really good cheat sheet just because if

220
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,040
you do ever end up doing machine

221
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,899
learning and you're using scikit-learn

222
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,180
in Python you will probably come across

223
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,430
this and this is brilliant especially if

224
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,319
you're starting out but for most of us

225
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,680
we're like my world from Fawlty Towers

226
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,070
but let me go through each little bit of

227
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,829
this diagram so regression the classic

228
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,160
example of regression you can see here

229
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:40,510
so if you've got 1,000 houses or who

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,730
says I suppose in dundee francs you can

231
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:49,870
fold them on a graph where X is the

232
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:54,100
price and Y is the highest sorry all the

233
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:57,310
way around I'm really good at completely

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,070
right but anyway so

235
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,439
you plot the price and the size on a

236
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,450
graph and you put each house that you've

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,820
got and undie that you know about on to

238
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,950
the graph so one is here what is there

239
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,779
etcetera etcetera then what you will do

240
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,600
is you will try to use an algorithm to

241
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,880
draw a line that will best represent all

242
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,150
of this data which means that then if

243
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,270
you've got a new house that is of a

244
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,160
certain size you can go okay well it's

245
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,089
there going up to this line it is

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:33,600
probably going to cost around plus very

247
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:33,600
cheap but like 1,300 pounds apartment

248
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,939
and here I will quickly go into

249
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,950
overfitting so one of the issues that

250
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,830
you will encounter if you are going to

251
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,900
use this kind of algorithm is that you

252
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,600
might overfit the data what this means

253
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,970
is that when you draw this line you can

254
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,300
make it fit the data points that you've

255
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,580
got so well like here that if you change

256
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,579
the data your line won't be

257
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:05,589
representative of the new data anymore

258
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:07,240
so for example if we put a house here if

259
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:10,030
you had a new house work that with the

260
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,680
size that is here on the graph you would

261
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,949
see that it's maybe not going to be as

262
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,050
representative as one that you would put

263
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,690
on a line that is just right and then

264
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:23,199
underfitting is the other side of the

265
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,940
spectrum where obviously you're not

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,010
going to have any meaningful results if

267
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,410
your line is just basically drawing

268
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:34,810
wherever but next bit of the lovely

269
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:39,670
python diner so we've got classification

270
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:42,939
I touched on this briefly before so I'm

271
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,400
going to do this fast classification is

272
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,459
a supervised learning approach where is

273
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,709
a computer learns from labelled data and

274
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,410
uses this to classify new observations

275
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,699
so it could be by class so for example

276
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,770
malicious not malicious but it also

277
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,430
could also be a number of different

278
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,140
classes now the why a classification

279
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,630
actually has loads of applications

280
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,770
especially in computer security not only

281
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:11,140
but here as well you know is it malware

282
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,760
is it phishing is it malicious

283
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,100
all of these things can be solved using

284
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,730
machine learning algorithms the problem

285
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,590
is finding good labelled ixelles

286
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,780
clustering now clusterings are really

287
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,090
interesting and the reasons that you do

288
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,089
it are actually quite cool so it's an

289
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,260
unsupervised learning method where what

290
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,270
you're going to try and do is find

291
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,830
meaningful structure or groupings in a

292
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,060
set of data again like I said before

293
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,370
uses the similarity and dissimilarity

294
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,510
between objects to put them into certain

295
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,880
groups now you use this on data that you

296
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,800
usually don't know much about this is

297
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,080
called explorative analysis so the

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,479
reason that this is hard is because for

299
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,830
most algorithms firstly you need to

300
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,860
determine how many groups you're going

301
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,780
to group it into and for that you need

302
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,930
to basically look at the data I boa and

303
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,939
have some kind of intuition or use

304
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,500
complicated and complex statistical

305
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:14,230
analysis to figure out how many groups

306
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:18,160
you want to create and the other issue

307
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,920
is that it's kind of hard to interpret

308
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,660
the data sometimes because humans are

309
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,339
very good at understanding data that is

310
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,790
in multiple dimensions because we can't

311
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:31,240
visualize it then we can't see it now

312
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,800
apart from finding groups of things you

313
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,440
can also use clustering for anomaly

314
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,660
detection so if you've got three very

315
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,400
clear groups like here but then you put

316
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,870
some little blobs that are outside of

317
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,880
one of the groups you can think oh well

318
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:47,080
maybe that's an anomaly which is useful

319
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:54,150
in security the last bit of the graph is

320
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:56,350
dimensionality reduction which is the

321
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,740
10-minutes dama pairing in a bit quick

322
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:04,120
which is which is reducing the number of

323
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,880
random variables in a dataset so that in

324
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,470
a dataset where you will have a number

325
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,939
of relevant features that are going to

326
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,700
solve your problem so for example if

327
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,690
you've got a email that will have

328
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,010
features such as the lengths of the

329
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,700
actual content of the email the time it

330
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,130
was sent and let's say this under domain

331
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,380
and you might think

332
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,689
for fishing the thing that you want to

333
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,070
use to classify as fishing or not would

334
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,240
be this under domain rather than the

335
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,210
time that it was sent because that could

336
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,040
be random not going into it in detail

337
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,110
dimensionality reduction is basically

338
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,390
trying to figure out which of the

339
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,850
features are less important than others

340
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,860
and taking them away or making them less

341
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,670
impactful on the machine learning model

342
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:53,400
and yeah I'm not going to be honest so

343
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:55,589
why do we need this let's look at this

344
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,000
from a kind of enterprise security point

345
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,100
of view because I assume that most

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,130
people here are going to move into that

347
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,780
space at some point in their life so we

348
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,300
have a lot of data and we have to

349
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:10,230
protect organisations from threats and

350
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,889
we have to detect them as well so we use

351
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,390
lots of for intelligence feeds

352
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,980
rule-based IDS's rules about file

353
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,470
downloads outside should to try and do

354
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,000
this but with a growing number of data

355
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:27,569
and excuse me of the term but the cyber

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,960
threat landscape ever opened and the

357
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,629
infamous skill shortage in security

358
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,860
we need our people to be charging Prats

359
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,380
that actually exists

360
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,669
and there is a lot of false positives in

361
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,800
socks thank you

362
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,500
socks isn't security operation centers

363
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:49,320
no socks my mom is going to watch this

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:52,410
one day and she'll be like more so the

365
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,950
vision for this is that sorry I'm going

366
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,780
to stay here

367
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,060
it's not easy there are lots of

368
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,950
accessible libraries and toolkits to do

369
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,510
machine learning in general but we still

370
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,120
need skilled developers to be able to

371
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,590
not only understand security but also

372
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,939
understand how to choose the different

373
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,740
features that we're going to use to

374
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,720
build our machine learning models now

375
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,340
machine learning security use cases are

376
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,340
usually divided into two different

377
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,010
things one is pattern recognition and

378
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,320
one is anomaly detection it's easy to

379
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,280
conflate both of them but they have

380
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,429
slightly different goals

381
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,920
so in pattern recognition we're going to

382
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,410
detect characteristics and data and

383
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,930
these characters which can be used later

384
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,130
to teach an algorithm to recognize forms

385
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,070
of data that are the same or different

386
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,140
from

387
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,850
characteristics well an anomaly

388
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,330
detection you're trying to baseline

389
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,610
normal and find a notion of normality

390
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,669
that statistically covers most of the

391
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,199
data that you have and then anything

392
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:55,420
that differs from that will be classed

393
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:59,320
as an anomaly so this is kind of the

394
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,790
most important bit of this hope so if

395
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,080
you want to learn more about machine

396
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,240
learning it is actually pretty

397
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,020
accessible even though the Massa's heart

398
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,940
so I started off with a this course on

399
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,260
plural sight sorry you have to pay for

400
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,960
plural tighteners also loads of really

401
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,270
good three ones and this machine

402
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,490
learning by Stanford is really good but

403
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,550
you have to do it in like MATLAB or R or

404
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,940
something isn't Python so I was like no

405
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,830
um but scikit-learn and Python is really

406
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,480
good even just reading the documentation

407
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,639
is really good for looking at

408
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,380
applications in these cases although not

409
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,910
necessarily for security and last but

410
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,520
not least machine learning is difficult

411
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,380
but don't get discouraged if I can do a

412
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,660
little bit of it you can all definitely

413
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,180
do a little bit I think is a really

414
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,070
valuable and rewarding area to get into

415
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,590
especially as it makes you think about

416
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,750
what is actually important in security

417
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,419
and how we can make you know the output

418
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,870
of security professionals useful to a

419
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,480
business or a country or whoever you

420
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,979
work for and also you can really impress

421
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,400
your friends and family by saying oh

422
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,980
yeah I do machine learning so that was

423
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,240
following me on Twitter once again and

424
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,240
thank you so much for your attention

425
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:42,330
good question so the I'm not really

426
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,710
allowed to talk in depth about the

427
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,360
projects that I did it work however the

428
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,760
stuff I was working on also required

429
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,850
domain expertise in networks and network

430
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,170
security so I think that if I hadn't

431
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,550
known that and I had a new mission

432
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,450
learning I would have been completely

433
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:06,060
screwed for lack of a better word um but

434
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,980
I think intuition about maths and just

435
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,470
kind of in the village he I did not set

436
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,490
the school I don't we did a one course

437
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:21,330
in uni but it was really well great this

438
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:23,100
is being filmed so I think like having a

439
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,409
bit of an aptitude for mathematics was

440
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,120
also really useful but apart from that I

441
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,800
think as with everything is just grit

442
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,870
and determination you know whenever

443
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,820
you're well maybe I'm going to lose your

444
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,629
job but whenever your boss is telling

445
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,750
you to do it you just do it yeah sorry

446
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:45,120
right yes that is a good point good for

447
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:51,840
coming I couldn't to be honest any other

448
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:54,149
questions okay oh so a big problem with

449
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,070
machine learning anything that you do

450
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:01,050
I'm still just as we are - so just the

451
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,379
five decisions that are all who makes

452
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,500
you have any negative implications if

453
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,900
you cyber security so for example unlike

454
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,940
in historical an assault can I have this

455
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,240
machine learning that box reinstated

456
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,370
it's giving me all my nice through

457
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,720
positives what about the false positive

458
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:26,129
sort of things in helping catch DCU

459
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:29,040
agent up so I'm going to answer this

460
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:34,320
question to both as well as I can

461
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,750
so to the gdpr thing there is a lot of

462
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,260
attention put into processing people's

463
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:43,920
data in general and GDP or as and I'm

464
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,490
not an expert by my shirt or don't you

465
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,020
GPR but there is a lot of attention

466
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,080
button to things like dates and lasting

467
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,600
so making sure the data is anonymous and

468
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,610
in terms of I don't know how to DPI

469
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,419
works for kind of regulatory compliance

470
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:04,830
for not responding to cyber incidents

471
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:06,690
but I mean yes see whenever you deploy

472
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,159
an algorithm a machine learning

473
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,960
algorithm that you don't really

474
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,720
understand on to about tenets telling

475
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,310
you this is true the schools you have to

476
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,330
be able to justify the decision that you

477
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,250
made and I know that in the financial

478
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,679
sector regulators are incredibly strict

479
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,300
and it probably get really screwed if

480
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,050
you make the wrong decision at some

481
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,790
point but yeah I mean I think that's the

482
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,970
reason that we employ experts that will

483
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,750
own the risk for like anything any other

484
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,750
questions

485
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:46,340
manual police a national excitation um

486
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:48,899
so I think it will definitely help I

487
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,370
don't think I'm really qualified to

488
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,430
answer it but we'll replace it

489
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,110
completely I think you know machine

490
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,660
learning algorithms are already being

491
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,129
used to navies and things like that that

492
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,440
doesn't mean we don't have relay systems

493
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,030
as well I think at the point that

494
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,960
they're battering more effective but

495
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,830
yeah we'll use them but I don't think

496
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,900
because of the complexity of

497
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,060
implementing these things in the first

498
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,450
place I think you know rather than there

499
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,250
being a bunch of people that write rules

500
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,480
for assault will be a bunch of people

501
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,310
that write machine learning I'll bring

502
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,110
this Chris offering this will have to be

503
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,639
tested as well you know the whole

504
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,449
problems just going to repeat itself is

505
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,190
just going to be more complex any other

506
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,610
questions oh I'm out of time today thank

507
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,610
you so much
