1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm Dominic's bill oh yeah this is

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,580
ridiculous radios I added some things to

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,769
it since I read slide thanks welcome it

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:19,000
ridiculous our radios because it's more

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:21,310
ridiculous at least one minute I'm on

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Twitter if that's your thing that's on

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,950
it yes I'm not really on any other

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,570
social media it's like like it was so

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:33,850
I'll I suppose thanks like oh yeah

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:36,670
definitions it sorry to the camera

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,230
operator so I just want to thank some

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,059
people I'd like to I like to put thanks

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,928
up at the front because one by the end

14
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,940
of this talk will be rough and - I like

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:50,230
to make it very clear but none of this

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,480
work is I mean this work is all original

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,879
work that I've done with people across

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,828
for gadgets but it's based on a lot of

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,289
people there's a lot of historical words

20
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,729
related to it not everything in this is

21
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,530
something revolutionary that I came up

22
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,300
with right before this tool a lot of the

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,119
stuff is based on ideas from other

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,048
people and there is people who help me

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,960
get demos together and the one person we

26
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:17,110
won't mention on this is Alex who is the

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,179
fourth row and let me a soldering iron

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,119
this morning here's me using the

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,719
sovereign on this morning because only

30
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,159
of butane miles and lands he's inside so

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,719
I work for graceful gadgets always so

32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,469
let's get through this night all

33
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,630
right

34
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,329
I heard I well Chris credits I write

35
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,350
software and things I am NOT Tim Brown

36
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:40,449
as your my bio says in the in the book

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,710
that you've all been given so if you

38
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,270
don't do me a solid and just cross that

39
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,048
line out in your booklets I trust you

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,449
all to do that I'm going to present four

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,450
different sort projects together in this

42
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,060
in this presentation they are two

43
00:01:52,450 --> 00:02:00,670
receivers and two transmitters they're

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,439
generally radios that are designed in in

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,969
ways that can be built on top of

46
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,889
hardware without having to think about

47
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:10,079
radio engineering

48
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:14,260
they're fairly simple radios to design

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,850
we're not we're not building a hack RF

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,160
or or something suit

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,680
complicated a high quality radio

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,120
receiver or transmitter it's it's a sort

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,630
proof-of-concept like can we make a

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,380
thing worth once and so generally these

55
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,900
have all worked once and I have a I have

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,840
a demo that even when it works works

57
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,970
from about a foot away and given the

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,010
audience is more than a foot away that

59
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,020
demo is I will I'm more than happy to do

60
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,310
a live and but no one will be able to

61
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,000
see that it works you just gonna have to

62
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,190
go and believe me on that one so so they

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,320
start up with disclaimer you should know

64
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,609
and understand your local laws I'm not

65
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,299
saying you have to obey them that's in

66
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,610
target to you however thing that's

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,430
notable is that car keys character

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,960
openers that a lot of radio things that

69
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,030
aren't Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or or whatever

70
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,460
but are unlicensed and you can just have

71
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,650
a full 33 megahertz if you start playing

72
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,840
around with them you're very much in the

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,550
middle of where the UK Tetra frequencies

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,650
are etc frequencies are used for

75
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,020
ambulance dispatch and fire engines and

76
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,910
if you miscalculate and get your

77
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,860
frequency off quite a bit and you jam an

78
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,070
ambulance signal that's really really

79
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:28,360
bad so I clearly try to obey that all

80
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:32,489
when I do this stuff my my overarching

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,230
feeling on it eriously just don't be

82
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,630
wait don't interfere with other people

83
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,609
you don't get in their way

84
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,640
and still stick to your own stuff and

85
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,380
generally I prefer to build receivers

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,119
rather than transmitters anyway to snoop

87
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:52,269
on other people instead of interfering

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,970
with them and I will demonstrate at

89
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,340
least one of the transmitters I won't be

90
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,620
demonstrating today but at home video

91
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,480
form because it wouldn't be legal to be

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,200
transmitted effort me to demonstrate in

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,380
the UK anyway because of Amazon so start

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,640
with scenario we can get cheap

95
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,380
microcontrollers there are micro

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,630
controls and absolutely everything go

97
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,060
there or whatever there are loads and

98
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,890
loads of them inside every either like

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,899
train twice you have your phone has a

100
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,029
ton of them it's not just the processor

101
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,489
it's the baseband is the Bluetooth chip

102
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:28,039
is the Wi-Fi chair bits but a thing that

103
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,169
controls power delivery to the

104
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,430
both in the charger at the other end of

105
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,460
the cable your phone when you're

106
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,099
charging the phone there in I mean like

107
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,388
I cannot see this everything here has

108
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,979
microcontrollers and there's a mouse

109
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,550
here that's money in it probably it's

110
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:45,050
Radio packs headphones everything and

111
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,400
they're all running firmware most of

112
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,319
them running custom firmware designed

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,008
for their application and if we can

114
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,750
modify that firmware can we maybe get it

115
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,639
to do interesting things and we approach

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,250
this from the idea of things like air

117
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,250
gap networks if we're able to modify the

118
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,090
code running on our laptop can we just

119
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,819
use say for example your keyboard

120
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,099
controller to receive wireless or

121
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,690
transmit wireless signals now a lot of

122
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:13,159
these microcontrollers have a ton of

123
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,650
stuff built in it's not where it always

124
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,680
necessarily used but it's it's built in

125
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,780
anyway and these are peripherals various

126
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,880
things so if anyone's here for Joe's

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,799
talk earlier he gave presentation about

128
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,409
how you could run spy and JTAG and UART

129
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,030
and I squid see all of the same chip so

130
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:34,969
now someone might take that chip and

131
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,669
embed it in a product for the spy

132
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:39,860
functionality but they don't entirely

133
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,049
disable the other functionality if we

134
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,180
can unlock that and use that then we can

135
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,430
get it to do JTAG or we can get it to do

136
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,280
I squid C or us or whatever else we want

137
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,320
to do and so if we can pick up an

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,090
off-the-shelf microcontroller with an

139
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,130
analog to digital converter net can we

140
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,859
build a very simple radio receiver at

141
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,229
space so we call this breadboard SCR

142
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,370
it's using a soulfulness breadboard and

143
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:08,030
it looks like this this is on the left

144
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,770
hand side this is a great pet one which

145
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,619
is just a microcontroller breakout board

146
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,139
that we designed a graceful gadgets this

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,210
doesn't require that piece of hardware

148
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,680
the software I've written works for that

149
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,870
piece of public but you could go and

150
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,130
build this on top of other platforms as

151
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,699
long as it has an animal and once

152
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,319
digital converter there are three wires

153
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,849
connecting that to our other circuit

154
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,620
board I don't know how well you can see

155
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:33,080
that but those two components are a

156
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,060
diode and a resistor because we could

157
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,190
hopper engineers we've done second

158
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,810
diagram the circuit diagram shows you

159
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,919
the three wires

160
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,830
the diode and resistor and and this is a

161
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,139
radio this is a radio receiver when we

162
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,250
first tested it Mike's first comment was

163
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,660
WOW it transmits as much as it receives

164
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,190
you really shouldn't use this like this

165
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,690
is not a good radio this will get you in

166
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:06,560
trouble with calm but you should you you

167
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,480
should use this as a base like this is

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,020
essentially what most software-defined

169
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,240
radios are and then everything else is

170
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,599
just to improve the signal quality the

171
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,550
bandwidth the interference all these

172
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,150
sorts of things is what most of the rest

173
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:27,590
of the board is bought now so the way

174
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,799
this works is we I mean let me explain

175
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,179
the the circuit diagram first so the

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,979
clock signal comes out of a

177
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,070
microcontroller that's whatever

178
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,020
frequency wants to tune to we combine

179
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,450
that oh wow I shouldn't lean on the

180
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:50,299
buttons for so I clicking I'm sorry

181
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:51,830
Bella professional so so what we want to

182
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,800
do is we have a we have a frequency we

183
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,750
want to receive we generate that

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,750
frequency with the clock on the

185
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,430
microcontroller we combine that with the

186
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,110
signal come from the antenna goes

187
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,360
through a diode the diode acts as a

188
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,010
mixer it combines those two and and when

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,770
you mix two signals together what you

190
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,039
end up with is one of those signals

191
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,359
shifted downwards in frequency by the

192
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
other one

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,039
so what we end up doing if we put 433

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,080
megahertz in to the clock we get

195
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,240
whatever we receive over-the-air shifted

196
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,550
down by 433 makers we stopped with an

197
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,770
ADC and then we put it into can you

198
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,930
radio has anyone used a new radio before

199
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,120
going to some quick show of hands okay

200
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,099
this this is typically rated flow graph

201
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,159
I'm more than happy to talk people

202
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,409
through it individually later but it's

203
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,718
probably not all that interesting as a

204
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,370
group exercise essentially what this

205
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,850
does is to take the analogs digital

206
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:51,020
converter samples and turns them into

207
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,390
audio and in FM t modulates them and

208
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,060
does various data conversion things

209
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,590
throttling speed and stuff like that and

210
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,660
what you end up with is a is a graph

211
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,750
coming out on the left hand side here

212
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,360
you can see on the top section of these

213
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,010
two plots it's what we're most

214
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,210
interested in on the left hand side this

215
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,090
there's silence and on the right hand

216
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,000
side you can see FM audio being

217
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,740
modulated there and the the the

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,890
amplitude there is the is the audio that

219
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:22,480
we're receiving and if you light up in

220
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:25,910
in the spectrum thanks Mike you can see

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,290
and try and point at this and see if

222
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,990
this works this will not come out well

223
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,480
of the video you can see audio here so

224
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,950
this is we we sample the the red line

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,430
which is where our signal is on the top

226
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,860
and on the bottom plot we're looking at

227
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,969
FM demodulation of that and one of the

228
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,380
things that gives us a way is we

229
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,360
transmitted this with a little handheld

230
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,950
ham radio and in the end of the

231
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,440
transmission when you let go of the

232
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,870
button it sends out a pilot time and the

233
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,160
pilot tone is just a sine wave and you

234
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,370
can see that right in the far right hand

235
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,959
side you have a very regular signal

236
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,340
being transmitted and that's a good sign

237
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:05,920
that we got the signal that we wanted

238
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,920
and wait I have to do a microphone thing

239
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,199
[Music]

240
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:19,700
that work hey can you still hear me Wow

241
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:22,400
I think it's not one providing feedback

242
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,140
because it works but we'll see we shall

243
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,740
see what happens okay I should be able

244
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,689
to load up this flow graph breadboard

245
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,040
SDR narrowband FM this is the same flow

246
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,110
graph you just saw but it's loading from

247
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,110
file because I can't transmit in the UK

248
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,300
I don't have a license so I'm not not

249
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,950
demonstrating the transmitter I'm just

250
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,949
demonstrating and all that it was safe

251
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,020
the data as as we received it and

252
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:56,320
hopefully I've just realized I need

253
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:56,319
audio out benign so

254
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,790
so Mike and I were able to transmit with

255
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,939
this ham radio and then with a

256
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,160
microcontroller that costs I think the

257
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,010
chip itself costs about ten ten pounds

258
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,020
something like that and we were able to

259
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,460
then take two of them two components and

260
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,090
build a radio that we can receive

261
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,910
hammering it with so that that's a good

262
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:25,540
start

263
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:31,219
all right you want something and also

264
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:32,959
maybe this should be full screen okay so

265
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,000
if you're building a radio in software

266
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,340
you guys we don't need multiple one we

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,340
can build very very simple radios we can

268
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,900
build a radio that receives data with

269
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,940
only two components so if you can

270
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,650
smuggle a diode and a resistor into your

271
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,050
air-gapped Network we can probably build

272
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,510
a receiver on that end I want to find

273
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,890
software without having to smuggle in a

274
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,689
hack RF or a thing that looks like a

275
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,580
radio to anyone else also our antenna

276
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,860
was just a piece of wire you'll see

277
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,630
throughout this presentation we're not

278
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,400
super picky about the antennas to be

279
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,050
used for this mostly because we're

280
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,670
working in a lab environment we're

281
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,949
working in a in the mountains outside

282
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,510
Denver in Colorado there's not as much

283
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,310
radio noises there would be if you were

284
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,950
doing it here and we generally trying to

285
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,810
be good citizens about it and not

286
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,950
transmit too much but we're doing

287
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:26,959
everything super low power so scenario

288
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:28,970
two we got we've got data into a device

289
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,470
that is not we've got radio signals

290
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,990
received by a device there's no

291
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,620
traditional radio can we transmit them

292
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:41,900
back out let's say we we're in again I

293
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,240
got Network can we use a microcontroller

294
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,310
to transmit things so cause of clock

295
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
signal transmitters his basement of

296
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,459
people's work Mike Walters who's sat in

297
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,920
the third row did this back in 2016 at

298
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,150
security I think I mean not as a

299
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,790
presentation because it's at a room

300
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,860
somewhere playing around but he was able

301
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,010
to turn on

302
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,110
remote-controlled light bulb using just

303
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,290
turning on and off the clock signal on

304
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,850
sweetie has done a fun tenor which was a

305
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:15,709
hacker but I think it's disco point

306
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,390
phone and they they were able the group

307
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,500
who didn't were able to toggle like

308
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:24,800
along a very long trace on the PCB so

309
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,940
that they could transmit data and

310
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,719
Raspberry Pi at home works in a slightly

311
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,650
different way so sorry with our cut

312
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,960
people trying to get photos outside

313
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,430
before I skipped it I will publish the

314
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,740
slides afterwards as long as your photos

315
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,540
you it's fine so again Lee this is this

316
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,460
is my transmitter again I'm using the

317
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,890
the great Fed board because I have one

318
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,330
on my desk as well use it and I wrote

319
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,060
the solver for it so it's a lot easier

320
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,910
to know what I'm doing that is my

321
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,949
antenna now again this antenna was

322
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,780
picked in the same way we picked the

323
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,400
previous antenna which was I reached

324
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,579
into a box of wires and pulled one out

325
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,800
and then I plugged into the board and it

326
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,490
worked so I didn't replace it if it

327
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,780
hadn't worked

328
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,000
I may have replaced it with one of the

329
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,640
different lengths but you can do you

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,970
know math but why do maths when it works

331
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,680
first time so how's this work I like to

332
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,260
turn up the game from from what my

333
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,719
walters did so instead of doing on/off

334
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,390
King I did a frequency shift keying I

335
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,040
want to do it 315 megahertz which is why

336
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,890
I can't demo in the UK because that's

337
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,290
not an unlicensed band here but it's

338
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,140
really common in the US and in fact it

339
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,930
is it's very common for all those things

340
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:40,010
Carlos garage door openers those sorts

341
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,839
of things now one thing I could do is

342
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,810
what Roderick yfm does I could just

343
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,420
modify the clock generator on the fly

344
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,750
that's a bit complicated and seem like a

345
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,250
lot of effort and code but the nice

346
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,110
thing about my microcontroller is having

347
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,870
multiple clock generators so PLL is a

348
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,060
facelock boots just a fancy word for a

349
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,910
clock generator for the purposes of this

350
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,719
talk is much fancier than that but they

351
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,640
say that I could use two of them as long

352
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,320
as I just say what my USB interface so I

353
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,890
did that I couldn't give me here the

354
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,230
device but I could generate two signals

355
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,000
one at 305

356
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,300
because on one or three hundred fifteen

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,880
point one and then I use the seu the SCU

358
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,890
is just a pin matrix it just decides

359
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,140
which which functionality inside the

360
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,699
chip is connected to outside if you

361
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,830
remember Joe talking about things

362
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,370
earlier he talked about how sometimes

363
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,690
JTAG is not available on chip because

364
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,880
they're using those pins of something

365
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,650
else that's what the seu is it - not

366
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,450
almost any microcontroller of a

367
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,280
reasonable complexity you just don't

368
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,360
have enough pins around the chip for the

369
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,480
functionality that you want to produce

370
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,860
so you use this matrix to switch things

371
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,750
pins on up so the the SC you just decide

372
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,340
which pin is connected to the output and

373
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,530
now I can switch back and forth between

374
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,560
two frequencies just by changing the

375
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,290
sust you just points to which pin is

376
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,089
connected so I just change which clock

377
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,230
is put out at the given time and I can

378
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:11,170
send frequency shift key later so this

379
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,260
is my car I load the code and if you

380
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:17,800
look at the front curve it unlocks this

381
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,270
actually works so well that Mike had not

382
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,829
started filming this when I ran it the

383
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,160
first time and because my car uses

384
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,900
rolling coves we then had to get cat for

385
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,939
another code you have to be away from

386
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,319
the car when you do it so this resulted

387
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,570
in Mike and Mike Horstman a night

388
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,610
running up and down the road outside our

389
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,170
our office building to get out the frame

390
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,850
to my car to capture a couple of key

391
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:41,410
presses then decode them visually using

392
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,790
in spectrum and then load that into

393
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,980
firmware and then running back to the

394
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,449
car to running again so we did that

395
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,760
about three or four times but but we

396
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,090
find the gutter now one thing is

397
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,770
interesting about this is that my car my

398
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,110
car center frequency the frequency is

399
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,420
expecting to see the signal on is 315

400
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,820
point zero zero five bill I can

401
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,800
configure my clocks back easily

402
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,710
again like it seemed like a lot of

403
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,359
effort to try and skim it by that much

404
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:13,210
so I put a 350 point zero five that's 45

405
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,909
kilohertz off the frequency deviation

406
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:19,270
between the binary one and zero is only

407
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,460
25 kilos so I'm outside of the range

408
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,040
that it's expecting for its original

409
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,890
signal plus I couldn't configure it to

410
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,950
get the 25 kilohertz range

411
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,740
I got plus and minus 50 kilohertz it

412
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,260
does not care it absolutely works and

413
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,940
part of the reason is it's a bit like

414
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,650
lock-picking if you go and talk to

415
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,730
people that lock-picking they say the

416
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,590
only reason you can pick locks is

417
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,299
manufacturing tolerances we can't

418
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,030
manufacture a lot so perfect that you

419
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,760
can't you know nudge the pins and things

420
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,190
like that it's the same deal why build a

421
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,080
radio that is so carefully and precisely

422
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,549
controlled that I can't transmit - it's

423
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,350
slightly off frequency into my car

424
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,809
you've already got rolling codes for

425
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,820
security you want it to work when my

426
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,100
battery's low you want it to work in

427
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,020
weird conditions once it's work in the

428
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,780
presence of noise so you can build a

429
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,840
radio as cheaply as possible and that

430
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,389
means that you don't have super perfect

431
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,250
filters you don't have you know

432
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,140
rejection of those signals that are just

433
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,780
slightly out of bound and as long as my

434
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,020
my signal is powerful enough and like

435
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,610
look how far away I am from the receiver

436
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,120
then it still works and I can still

437
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,469
unlock my car I guess the other reason I

438
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,209
can't do this is what I know is my car

439
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,460
is thousands of miles away and it'd be

440
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,390
tricky to get get it here and into this

441
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,650
building for a very very quick and dull

442
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:43,559
demo okay so so our learning is like not

443
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,900
only can we build it in software and we

444
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,190
don't need much hardware but if it

445
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,580
oscillates like a radio as a clock

446
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,429
signal does and then it emits as a radio

447
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,139
when we plug a wire into that pen then

448
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,970
it's a regular just because the

449
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,799
microcontroller calls their clock signal

450
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,870
and it's designed to share the clock

451
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,400
with other chips on the same circuit

452
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,949
board doesn't mean it's not a regular

453
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,770
it's still able to transmit where it's

454
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,210
still able to use later you use it to

455
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,610
transmit data so this one's gone to a

456
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:21,179
third scenario in terms of time yeah

457
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:25,799
wait let me go make it so the scenario

458
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:28,230
is that there will be regimes they'll be

459
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,150
governments around the world where they

460
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,160
do not allow us to help us animals

461
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,960
Dishman versus the first radio relied on

462
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,300
us having a cheap analog to digital

463
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,830
converter inside a radio inside a

464
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,280
microcontroller sorry so we could use

465
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,350
flow record but

466
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,629
there might be regimes around the world

467
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,370
that limit access to animals digital

468
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,020
converters and I know everyone's

469
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,389
thinking who would possibly do that and

470
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,550
here's a page out of the US government

471
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,660
regulations on Export Control and they

472
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,760
limit access to analog to digital

473
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,440
converters and in fact they live in

474
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,150
access to high precision analog Sutra

475
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,160
converters because they can be used for

476
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,290
advanced radio systems and things like

477
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,360
that all sorts of all sorts of things

478
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,879
require kind of converting data between

479
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,010
London Digital tonight and admittedly

480
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,500
these are incredibly high high precision

481
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,260
and we're looking at a resolution of 12

482
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,420
bits or more that's an output rate of

483
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,750
200 million words per second so it's 12

484
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,660
bit 200 megahertz ABC that is quite far

485
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,830
and away higher spec than we have on any

486
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,690
of the pub consumer st oz out there but

487
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,100
it is something to consider that we

488
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,840
might not have access to it is not

489
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,830
beyond the realms of possibility that we

490
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,320
might have a microcontroller that

491
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:41,010
doesn't have any so can we use a digital

492
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,720
i/o then we come to the GPIO pin the

493
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,700
receiver so we're going to build a

494
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,450
receiver that works instead of using

495
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,330
analog data uses digital data and this

496
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:55,320
is where we get a bit messy okay so

497
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,879
there's some very here and there are not

498
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,610
a whole lot of people in the room so I'm

499
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,860
going to delve into it but don't worry

500
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,240
if you get a bit lost

501
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,969
it's probably the my explanation is bad

502
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,630
and I will happily try again in front of

503
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,770
a white board with pallet paper later

504
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:14,580
this is the first generation that we

505
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,070
built and this the the silver box you

506
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,470
can see the back is a TV tuner it's

507
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,510
ripped from like an old video recorder

508
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:25,320
and you can just pull that out and it

509
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,809
will it will give you a good RF front

510
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,669
end so instead of using those two

511
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,139
components that we used on the the first

512
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,780
fret board SDR

513
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,790
we're we're taking in a higher quality

514
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,110
radio and it's got an amplification in

515
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,700
there and it's got some good filtering

516
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,280
in there and so we're getting a better

517
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,540
quality radio simple answer and I would

518
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,129
have liked a demo this and this is

519
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,670
actually how we captured the key presses

520
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,080
for my from my keyboard however a piece

521
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,230
of hardware landed on my desk last week

522
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,949
and I thought I couldn't give this

523
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,260
presentation

524
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,150
without trying to sneak an additional

525
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,010
thing into it so this has not been we

526
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,750
have spoken about this publicly yeah we

527
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,330
only got it working last week I only go

528
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,090
to working with my laptop yesterday and

529
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,389
I'm going to attempt a live demo and it

530
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,800
may go wrong quits so we we know a lot

531
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,870
of our experimental boards off some

532
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:18,419
flowers quince is a flowering plant

533
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:20,939
don't Matt me this board is a comparator

534
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,950
and a comparator just says is this

535
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:28,490
signal greater than or lower than a

536
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:31,860
threshold and it currently connects to

537
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:34,260
the RF content on hack RF now admittedly

538
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,310
this has been using an RF to build up

539
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,830
low great radio by bypassing the good

540
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,950
bits of hack RF but this is because it's

541
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,320
a prototype so in the future the Quinns

542
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,640
board will have a whole lot on this

543
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,580
basically where it says Queens it will

544
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:55,800
have a whole lot of additional circuitry

545
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:57,899
to do kind of analog analog electronics

546
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,940
to shift for supercool gigahertz range

547
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,800
down to base bounce so that we can solve

548
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,050
it but right now we're using the hacker

549
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,030
app for that so the hacker app will

550
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,379
change the 2.4 gigahertz and then we

551
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,720
connect to the expansion header on a

552
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,130
carafe and we solve that with the great

553
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,660
fat there's no rotation transfer

554
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,580
happening on that a correct we're just

555
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,260
using as a as a tuner so we're only

556
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,090
using the analog exception of that was

557
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,790
no SDR happen at all on the Quinns board

558
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,970
what we're doing is we're sampling using

559
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:28,680
a digital pin it is either on or off

560
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:33,350
there is no analog component to this and

561
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:38,130
that means we sample one bit

562
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,629
now conversion a problem we're going to

563
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,020
meet more than one bit of dynamic range

564
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:45,060
to look at our signals this is really

565
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,260
common in SDR you want a lot of dynamic

566
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,659
range she wants as much as possible

567
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,460
people talk about 12 bay DC's ain't bad

568
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,460
DC's is ain't there enough for this than

569
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,620
the other and things so we thought the

570
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,720
the best solution to show that 8 bits of

571
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,669
ADC in a prep is more than enough for

572
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,340
anybody would be to build a radio that

573
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,710
decode

574
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:07,810
with one bit of ABC one bit of dynamic

575
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:09,370
range and see how that works so we're

576
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,740
gonna use a technique called over sample

577
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,469
and decimate this thing it works in one

578
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:18,070
direction and this is where the sort of

579
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,210
maths comes in and I'm not going to talk

580
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,600
about the maths I'm just gonna show some

581
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,450
graphs but what we do is we take 16

582
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,610
samples like this and for every pair of

583
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,860
samples we average them to get one in

584
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,110
the middle now if you're averaging two

585
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,780
numbers so these are all 0 or 1 on bit

586
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,270
values if you're averaging those those

587
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,480
values you gain a bit of dynamic range

588
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,690
you can have half values if you do it

589
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,160
again you can have more values and so

590
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,650
now we have four different values

591
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,730
clusters there on the one I guess that's

592
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,220
it anyway

593
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,840
we have more values that we can have and

594
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,540
if you keep doing this and keep doing

595
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,909
this you gain for every time you have

596
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,950
your sample rate you gain one bit of

597
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,070
dynamic range if it's bit more

598
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,290
complicated than that but roughly now

599
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,379
this means if we saw pull if we have a

600
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,399
very narrow signal and we sample way way

601
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,250
wider than we need to

602
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,470
we can then decimate to just gain our

603
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,360
sample a signal back and we get more

604
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,620
dynamic range still work in the other

605
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,110
direction you can't get more bandwidth

606
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,360
by sampling a higher range and then

607
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:26,919
working the other way it only works this

608
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,590
way so it looks like this this is a

609
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:34,030
slightly more complicated flow graph but

610
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:38,199
essentially this is doing a a it's doing

611
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:41,310
a lot but but this is this is the main

612
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:46,090
domain book that we care of here is the

613
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,889
vs. we put a at the top to kind of read

614
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,000
them from from where you are but the top

615
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,190
two on the right we have a

616
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,529
the decimates and we have a rational

617
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,870
resource law but also decimates and so

618
00:25:54,529 --> 00:26:01,789
what we gain there is dynamic range as

619
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:03,139
we lose as we we lose bandwidth but we

620
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:05,029
don't care about that with because what

621
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:08,240
we're looking at is a 1 megahertz signal

622
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:10,129
now what we're going to solve lat

623
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,620
because it's a dis why open digital

624
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:15,230
opens a useful fast binary interfaces so

625
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,870
we can solve 100 mega Hertz so we can

626
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,759
hunter makes office a second but we only

627
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,789
need one mega sample second so we can

628
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,070
decimate and we gain a number of bits of

629
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:29,629
dynamic range in order to receive things

630
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:34,059
so using one bit sampling and substitute

631
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:34,059
determine switch much fun together

632
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:47,090
ok I've only run this once I've only had

633
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:56,029
this work once so everyone hope they

634
00:26:47,090 --> 00:27:00,980
worked for me sure I want I've got a

635
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:05,200
copy and paste the command so I'm just

636
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,429
tuning the hack RF at first to you a

637
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,049
freaking thing it's just gonna dump

638
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,029
songs into a file somewhere I'm not

639
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,129
going to use that file for anything then

640
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,720
what I'm going to do is use the the

641
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:16,039
great fit that's attached and I'm just

642
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,809
going to use the logic analyzer function

643
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,250
of it to stomp all those pins as quickly

644
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,649
as possible right now I have a

645
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,960
limitation of Pi USB and my firmware

646
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:26,178
that means I only get 17 mega mega

647
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,590
Sophos a second I just need to do some

648
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:34,970
tracking to get out to 100 and then I

649
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:38,658
should be able to go wait yes then I

650
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:43,840
turn on a device that should be next to

651
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:47,779
my phone and what we're using here

652
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,389
connect excellent and then I'm just

653
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:56,350
going to very briefly generate some some

654
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:58,000
traffic ok so that

655
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,740
that's generated some traffic and it's

656
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,120
all being saved to this quince for not

657
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:07,120
that far so let's kill it off let's go

658
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,979
to our complicated flow graph now what

659
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,979
this is going to read is that file but I

660
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:16,450
just broke it so give me turn my

661
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,679
headphones off that's gonna read this

662
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,399
file that we just wrote and it's gonna

663
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,279
output to a file called temp D mod so

664
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm just gonna run this now what you'll

665
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:29,860
see is in the top graph hopefully

666
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,149
creatively hopefully there you go this

667
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,549
is doing what's called burst tagging

668
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:35,199
it's finding packets in the data so if

669
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:36,700
you see these all look fairly regular

670
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,039
these are all the packets that were

671
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,379
transmitted that I was able to pick up

672
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:44,158
these are Bluetooth packets so what I'm

673
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:47,350
doing is simultaneously I am able to

674
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,110
receive 17 megabytes of data and then

675
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,699
take that one bit value and convert it

676
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,469
to enough bits to pull a Bluetooth data

677
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,610
but because that's done in the filter

678
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,690
because that's done for a specific

679
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,279
frequency I'm able to do it 17 times one

680
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,960
stage Bluetooth Channel in that 70

681
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,580
megahertz chunks once again it's up to a

682
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,570
hundred megahertz I'll be able to do it

683
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,490
for every Bluetooth channel

684
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,129
simultaneously and be able to sniff all

685
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,710
Bluetooth connections within range

686
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:20,129
simultaneously just using one bit ADC

687
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:24,490
software so and just to hopefully prove

688
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:26,408
if I run I output my data into a file

689
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,480
format that is accepted by bluetooth

690
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:32,220
tools because I happen to know a

691
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,750
developer or both because it's me and

692
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,940
what you'll notice is I was able to pull

693
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,509
out all these Bluetooth packets and this

694
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,940
el ap is the address is the MAC address

695
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:45,190
of my bluetooth headphones and I'm going

696
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,840
to pull all these packets out now the

697
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,159
channel information and verus on the

698
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,330
clock information is all wrong at the

699
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,220
moment because it's just a proof of

700
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,590
concept but I was able to accurately

701
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,360
receive and decode Bluetooth packets but

702
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,330
I was only using a digital i/o pin and

703
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,189
no animal to digital converter at all so

704
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:06,580
we don't even need an analog to digital

705
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:08,920
converter to digitize radio husband

706
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,449
excellence wait enough to go back

707
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,549
and keep the weight off right away

708
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,549
[Music]

709
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:25,510
all right Howard it's time all right

710
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:28,810
Oh interesting we might sleep over us

711
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,060
seize the function of my music so I'm

712
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,649
going to have to use the old method so

713
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,370
one bit diagram is more than enough for

714
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,870
anybody

715
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:40,860
everyone can stop complaining about

716
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:43,000
8-bit eighty-six okay final scenario

717
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,010
there's a thing called pseudo Doppler

718
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,670
direction-finding there are there are a

719
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:51,129
piece of hardware called the use for

720
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:54,490
finding radio signals so they are the

721
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,900
idea of them is that they are you want

722
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,270
to be able to track down people who are

723
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,860
transmitting now in general mostly that

724
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,420
you want to track down our people who

725
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,939
are interfering with you ham radio

726
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,430
operators use them a lot generally if

727
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,560
you transmit on a ham radio band

728
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,930
accidentally because without a license

729
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,149
ham radio operators will track you down

730
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,360
because it anyone else they are I mean

731
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:19,560
oh they're so good at it because they

732
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:23,439
care very passionate about it rationally

733
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,810
so might developed a pseudo topper

734
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,760
direction-finding rig we call an antenna

735
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:33,280
switching board it's also known as an

736
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:37,060
opera cake because we want food so can

737
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,770
we find some way to subvert it so I'm

738
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,050
calling this direction pointer to

739
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,250
direction fighter because I couldn't

740
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,370
think of a better name than better love

741
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,470
and hider and I even wrote the word so

742
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,159
I'm gonna say I can make my phone be

743
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:56,920
mine quickie thing again

744
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:59,740
okay that's France all right sit up top

745
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,630
the direction pointing not only am I not

746
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,540
good enough explaining things to get out

747
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,510
and at the time I have but it's already

748
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,800
been done by my husband and Skylar

749
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,180
actually got a couple years ago there's

750
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,649
a link on this slide go watch their

751
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,150
video and they'll explain how super

752
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,700
Doppler works and how it was with our

753
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:22,300
board and how we were able to attempt to

754
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:22,450
find things but but essentially huh this

755
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,760
is

756
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,070
your keyboard it's just a bunch of ports

757
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,629
and it switches antennas so you can have

758
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,830
an input coming in and it switches to an

759
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,290
antenna and you can electronically

760
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,610
switch your signal between antennas it's

761
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,899
really really useful for

762
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,209
direction-finding it's also useful for

763
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,030
light if you set up a ham radio rig and

764
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,050
your ones herb switch between antennas

765
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,399
that you're using and give them

766
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,780
frequency or you want to switch in

767
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,420
different filter banks and things like

768
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:54,160
that so let's talk about radio again if

769
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,350
we have to face shifting so does anyone

770
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,910
know about different has ever studied

771
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,760
radio things different forms of

772
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,490
modulation phase shifting any of the

773
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,620
stuff hands up okay well I'm gonna try

774
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,010
and say things that you understand and

775
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,300
I'm not very good about so you should

776
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,560
look the top of a textbook if you really

777
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,629
want to understand that and I can

778
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,970
recommend some textbooks to look

779
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,100
properly understand it and understand

780
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,240
the maths or anything like that really

781
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:24,010
don't want to put mass into my

782
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:27,460
presentation so I didn't phase shifting

783
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:29,050
is where you take a signal and instead

784
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,880
of changing the frequency of the

785
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:35,139
amplitude signal to change where you are

786
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,900
in the way for a given time so phase

787
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,180
shift keying works by making rate jumps

788
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,640
in the signal jumping from one point of

789
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,010
the signal to another when we're doing

790
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,350
Direction finding what we do is we take

791
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,420
multiple antennas and we switch between

792
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,300
them rapidly and usually in a circle and

793
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,080
that gives us a phase shift based on

794
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,090
where you're coming from

795
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,070
so essentially what happens is where you

796
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,580
are on the waveform is different at the

797
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,409
two antennas at the same time so you

798
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,419
don't want the size of your array to be

799
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,490
about the distance across already out of

800
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,530
third of your wavelength and that means

801
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,239
that if you rapidly switch from one end

802
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:13,090
to the other you'll see the same signal

803
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,429
but you'll see it just slightly off from

804
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:18,850
where it was and you can use that to try

805
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:22,330
and calculate the direction but we can

806
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,020
make that happen too we can induce a

807
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,150
phase shift

808
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,770
and they're there for the diffraction

809
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,330
point in triggers that think it sees a

810
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:34,179
patient but it's actually what we

811
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:35,489
control so this is a diagram I made in

812
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,899
the hotel room

813
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:42,149
at the time I thought it explained it so

814
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:45,719
implements time space shifting out right

815
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:48,330
but essentially like if you have if you

816
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,638
have two different lengths of cable or

817
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:54,659
two different placed antennas you will

818
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,220
be waveform that electricity that you're

819
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,869
transmitting electromagnets in the in

820
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,359
transmitting will reach them at

821
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:03,599
different times and therefore different

822
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:05,549
parts of that wave cycle and so what we

823
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,230
can do to introduce a phase shift in

824
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,000
something is have two different lengths

825
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,599
of cables these are often called delay

826
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,520
lines I spoke to someone about this

827
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,380
earth about a year ago and they said oh

828
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,230
yeah use delay lines I used to work in

829
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,320
fiber-optic we used to just run bounce

830
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,210
data between Silicon Valley and Los

831
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,550
Angeles to just conducive to lay into

832
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,790
the data because that's long enough for

833
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,950
it to ley line at the speed of light or

834
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,099
just like 30 kilometers of coiled

835
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:39,089
fiber-optic just as a delay loop in that

836
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:43,220
lab but we don't with RF we didn't have

837
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:46,500
to climb hooking at us and therefore a

838
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:49,169
quarter of a wavelength is about three

839
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,150
centimeters and therefore these four

840
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,670
cables that hook up to my upper cake are

841
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,810
all all centimeters all for each other

842
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,170
three centimeters off from each other

843
00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:05,240
and that means I can induce a phase

844
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:07,530
shift by cycling through them so Oh

845
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,089
openly preventing response was that this

846
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,330
video would work and we shall see what

847
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:14,490
happens so this is a direction-finding

848
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,299
rig this is one we set up the 2.4

849
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:20,759
gigahertz you can see in the glass the

850
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,940
four antennas they are at four different

851
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:28,160
locations and then they're separated by

852
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:30,570
roughly a third full wavelength and that

853
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,750
feeds into the applicator which feeds

854
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:39,300
into a Corral we just attach to my

855
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:41,160
laptop what's the slope I thought so

856
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,410
that's Mike laptop he's running his

857
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,529
direction-finding code on it already

858
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,879
this is my laptop this is my transmitter

859
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,510
and I have went too late lines on it but

860
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm not using

861
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:53,220
I'm just gonna start transmitting just

862
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,210
some data just gonna send some dates

863
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,649
around and I didn't pause it quite the

864
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,720
right moment but you'll see on Mike's

865
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,930
display in the top right corner there's

866
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,390
a sort of baby bath fuzzy blue dog that

867
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:10,319
gives us a direction from his direction

868
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:12,690
pointing really to my transmitter and we

869
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,580
are able to kind of use that and if you

870
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,070
calibrated properly he knows what the

871
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,509
transmitter is so what I want to do is

872
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,290
make it so his software mobile the

873
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:25,020
receives it correctly so what I do is I

874
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,880
just start looping through those four

875
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,270
different tables at different lengths

876
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,620
and you'll see we now have almost my

877
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,930
tenders with bouncing around all over

878
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,150
the place so we now don't have any idea

879
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,750
of the direction of the of the

880
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,670
transmitter so we're able to use the

881
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,830
exactly the direction finding rig that

882
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,220
he's using to detect us to subvert this

883
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:50,759
detection so you see it's jumping all

884
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,589
over the place oh that's really not what

885
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,880
I want to see there we go so adding a

886
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,950
phase shift certainly men sitting over

887
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,960
low now this is really gonna destroy

888
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,419
your signal if your signal relies on pay

889
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,010
shifts and things like that but if

890
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,130
you're using on/off key the frequency

891
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:08,250
shift then it's not you can you can get

892
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,540
away with it so and this is going to be

893
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,610
very quick because I'm running out of

894
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,259
time and this is the demo that only

895
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,820
works from about a foot away so I'm not

896
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,140
going to do it because Graham's already

897
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:21,300
his give is till next but since we can

898
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,970
modify the phase to support a direction

899
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,290
finding can we take a signal that is

900
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,629
being transmitted and has no face

901
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,360
component that we care about and add a

902
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,670
covert channel over the top of it

903
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,350
can we add on a face shift key signal to

904
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,210
an existing radio so I'm not even

905
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,370
talking about like building an SDR and

906
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:41,580
talking about taking taking our

907
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:45,600
operative board which looks like this

908
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:48,750
and a microcontrollers controller and no

909
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,310
radio or just take an existing radio

910
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:55,880
that we do not care about could be a

911
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:58,560
handheld ham radio device it could be

912
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,420
any radio that could be a Wi-Fi device

913
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,240
it

914
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:06,680
also the a Bluetooth number so this is

915
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,328
my transmitter this is a a like $3

916
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,509
Bluetooth Don what picked up from Amazon

917
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:13,130
we cut the trace to the to the antenna

918
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:16,579
on so ordered we just sold on the cable

919
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,990
and then we called out one of the test

920
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,730
functions that they left in the firmware

921
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,919
and the thing and got it's just trust me

922
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:27,260
transmit signal on a single channel and

923
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,750
so this was my my transmitter and so all

924
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,339
I'm doing is transmitting a 2.4

925
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:36,230
gigahertz carrier out of that and then

926
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:38,390
externally I'm just taking the Aquacade

927
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,059
board and I'm adding that phase shift so

928
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,950
this is in spectrum again grateful for

929
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:44,990
this sort of work and you can see this

930
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,450
is a face plots of the bottom of the

931
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,618
signal you see the top and these just

932
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,910
shows that these drums that are

933
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,599
happening and these are kind of

934
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:57,529
instantaneous these dots right here here

935
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,450
here and so we're able to create

936
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,809
instantaneous base jumps by switching

937
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:06,020
between different different lengths of

938
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:09,619
table on your paper so we have 2.4

939
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:13,790
gigahertz we have we can add phase shift

940
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:15,170
keying we can actually switch these 11

941
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,940
million times a second if we want to

942
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,950
that's how quickly our switches work

943
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,450
that's what faster than that but 11

944
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,230
million is going to be really convenient

945
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:26,180
in direct sequence spread spectrum is

946
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,059
actually just really really fast phase

947
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:33,859
shift keying so we could generate the

948
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:35,780
DSM s signal at 2.4 gigahertz and 11

949
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:41,960
megabits now does anyone know what let

950
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:44,450
me make a bit dsss signalized gram it is

951
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,349
Wi-Fi Wow

952
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,819
there you go so we're able to produce a

953
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:51,680
completely fictional Wi-Fi network from

954
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:53,329
a bluetooth dongle an antenna and two

955
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,000
lengths of antenna cable that are

956
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,589
different off by a half wavelength

957
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,730
between the two and switch back and

958
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:02,599
forth between them 11 megahertz using

959
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,589
antenna switching board had a

960
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,880
microcontroller

961
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:07,910
to generate a Wi-Fi network that never

962
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,199
existed it is completely pointless but

963
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,069
it's really good fun to do these sorts

964
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,499
of things this works from guaranty a

965
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:17,180
distance of about a foot and it really

966
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:18,799
really does not work at conferences when

967
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,379
everyone's got Wi-Fi and Bluetooth going

968
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,910
so it is not possible while I was able

969
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,019
to transmit from my phone to my

970
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:28,489
headphones and receive receive Bluetooth

971
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:29,899
packets in the middle for some reason

972
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,509
this is just not powerful enough to

973
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,739
really get two phones but we have

974
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:35,989
managed to pick it up in quiet

975
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:37,339
environments in our office and you can

976
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:39,559
see one of these is my phone one of

977
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:42,229
these is my boss's phone I explained and

978
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:45,829
we were to receive these the same the

979
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:48,859
same network on both so external

980
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:51,289
modulator or lanterns which you can have

981
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:53,660
a Coco channel to any existing radio if

982
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,759
you can connect it at you your coma

983
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,879
channel does not interfere with the

984
00:41:55,759 --> 00:42:00,049
existing underlying radio signal again

985
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,789
thanks to all these people who are

986
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:02,989
involved thanks to Alex for lending his

987
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,579
soldering on this morning even though I

988
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,890
didn't run the demos I needed to solder

989
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:10,849
this morning so that was potentially a

990
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:14,598
waste of time and I will not take

991
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:15,920
questions because a pretend to and grant

992
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,539
probably wants to scare set up for his

993
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,999
talk but I would say questions outside

994
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:21,319
or just find me around I'm very

995
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,058
approachable just come and ask me

996
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,949
questions if you have them you can find

997
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:26,809
me on Twitter or great spark edits and

998
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:28,309
Twitter and all of the code should be on

999
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:30,229
one of close two repositories to

1000
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:31,519
implementing of these so if you want to

1001
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:33,678
go ahead and implement these radios

1002
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,828
yourself do it legally do it safely

1003
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:40,209
don't interfere with ambulances and have

1004
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:40,209
fun with breakfast thank you very much
