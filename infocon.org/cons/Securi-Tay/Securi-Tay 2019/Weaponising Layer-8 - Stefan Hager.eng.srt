1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,530
stop yep mayhap thank you very much

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:12,260
this is weaponizing late and in the next

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,799
45 minutes to an hour I'd like to talk

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,550
to you about what layer eight actually

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,830
means and why we should talk about that

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,420
so for those of you not really familiar

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,299
with layer

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,060
eight layer eight is a term that we in

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,689
the InfoSec industry or ite generally

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,469
have used to describe users the stupid

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:39,530
people using our systems and we also

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,379
have called them other names like PAP

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:47,229
kak which is short for people exists

14
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:51,229
between keyboard and chair our idiots

15
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:53,539
basically and this was some kind of

16
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:56,388
negative thinking I think that some

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,299
people in the industry still have when

18
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:02,209
we call our colleagues people that use

19
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,129
our systems the weakest link we are not

20
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:07,610
really doing them justice I think and

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,100
this talk is relevant because as we

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,630
proof day by day we in the industry are

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,820
known I'm really managing in we are not

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,220
really capable to solve our problems in

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,410
the industry and we won't be able to

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,620
solve them without the people using our

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,950
systems so the problem is to get them on

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,740
board

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,840
the other alternative that every vendor

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,810
at our say for example that is running

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,270
now will tell you is just buy a box and

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,860
put the Box in the network probably

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,340
leave it unconsidered and it will solve

34
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,400
your security problems little spoiler it

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,210
probably won't what the boxin will do is

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,980
they will create a lot of screens and a

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,229
lot of information and a lot of

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,040
dashboards for your secure operation

39
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,690
center and it will be just wasted

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,200
information because at the end of the

41
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:03,110
day you will have not secured some of

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,170
your humans and my phone conviction is

43
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,228
that humans matter the original version

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,239
of this talk was created together with

45
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,939
Brian fight and some of the things you

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,260
seen the talk are attributed to him this

47
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:19,540
humans matter

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:25,060
is from his own conference as well so

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:28,430
before we get into how we can actually

50
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,230
weaponize our alkyl leaks I would like

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:36,190
to talk to you about how I think cyber

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,929
actually impacts the physical domain

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,880
let's start with something funny

54
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,340
I've brought and I've said that I've

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,230
brought a lot of gummy bears and when I

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,299
did that I realized that I wouldn't be

57
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,399
able to throw them at anyone because hey

58
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,760
I suck at throwing and be you're quite

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,360
far away so I'll just leave them there

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,328
if you fancy that stuff then just

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,730
perhaps and after my talk still I

62
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,950
wouldn't mind you participating in show

63
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,828
of hands if you want to who a few has

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,780
heard of the great German pizza was five

65
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:14,569
six years ago so for all of you who

66
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,920
haven't five or six years ago we have

67
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:21,108
two main portals selling fast food so

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,089
you locked on you fancied a pizza or

69
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:25,040
your pansies burger and you put your

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,340
order in and the pond would just send

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,280
the nearest delivery service to your

72
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,260
home so basically the same lie traffic

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,750
deliver ruin others what you have in

74
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,870
your country but the funny thing about

75
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,180
the two major place in Germany was they

76
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,410
started ddosing each other on Saturday

77
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,120
nights so basically the idea was if the

78
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,519
other guy couldn't get the order then

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm getting the order but if both are

80
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,260
ddosing then the other one then nobody's

81
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,239
getting the order so people went unfed a

82
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:04,069
little bit more serious is of course I

83
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,380
wanna cry so people who are not really

84
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,018
computer savvy or aren't online at all

85
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,139
we're impacted by stuff that happens in

86
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:14,329
the online world because hospitals

87
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,599
couldn't do with a job because their

88
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:22,130
systems were just blocked by ransomware

89
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:25,880
and the last example where I learned the

90
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,100
interesting term of swatting hope you

91
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,830
knows what's what heinous basically yeah

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,570
that's very good but how do we know it

93
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,490
because they're idiots calling the

94
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,260
police on somebody else because that is

95
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,870
what swatting means special weapons an

96
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,200
assault team and if you bear a grudge

97
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,540
against somebody and maybe you're a

98
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,760
teenager then you just call the police

99
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,610
and tell them there's something horrible

100
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,240
going on at that house and probably you

101
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,430
should go and have a look so when I was

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,530
a teenager we didn't have the internet

103
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:03,950
yet because gray hair stuff so I do

104
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,080
remember a friend calling a few services

105
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,690
to his neighbor because he hated him and

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,719
we found the funny at the time but it

107
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:16,270
wasn't the police it was just the people

108
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,490
you could call like a I don't know

109
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,950
hospitals the police we didn't call or

110
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,340
he didn't call so we thought that was

111
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,039
funny

112
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,330
in retrospect it was as dumb as this

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,780
 but the one thing that happened

114
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,140
over the one example that I'm having is

115
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,049
when two people had an online fight

116
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:43,190
about one dollar and fifty in the game

117
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,710
of Call of Duty 3 I think it was where

118
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,900
the people let's call them a and B I do

119
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:53,030
have the names but they are really not

120
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,940
that important a thought that P should

121
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,460
give him the $1 and 50 for an online

122
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,550
nature they had and P didn't feel like

123
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,060
it so a threatened to SWAT him and B

124
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,790
said go ahead this is my address but he

125
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,680
didn't give the right address so he gave

126
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,170
an address where he used to live years

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,430
and years ago and what happened this a

128
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:20,390
asked his pal C just want this guy so C

129
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,730
was known and very notorious for calling

130
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,200
the police on other people he described

131
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,570
a violent crime going on

132
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,640
he said the son already has murdered his

133
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,710
father and he has cornered the rest of

134
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,690
the family in the bathroom and please

135
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:36,289
couldn't the police come and have a word

136
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,500
with him so the police went to the

137
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,060
address that they had and they knocked

138
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,550
so

139
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,900
person D opened the door and for some

140
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,380
reason we will never know

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:52,099
he am he got nervous because he looked

142
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,750
into the guns of a few people of the

143
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,050
police people and he reached for his

144
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,720
waistband maybe to scratch his ass but

145
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,730
the police took that for he was to draw

146
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,130
a weapon because they thought a Weiland

147
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,120
crime is going on and they shot him and

148
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,120
they killed him for one dollar and fifty

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,770
which basically means that guy who

150
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,080
wasn't in one line who wasn't even

151
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,080
playing games got shot because of

152
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,409
something that went on in the cyber

153
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,640
domain so it isn't a question whether so

154
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,970
I have impacts the physical domain I

155
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:30,229
think that is pretty much improving it

156
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:33,980
does and it doesn't even have the need

157
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:38,060
of you to be online or in any way

158
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,760
interested in cyber so how could we

159
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,220
empower people how can we get our

160
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,760
colleagues to be better at security

161
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,580
because we tried for years or we as the

162
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,830
industry to just tell them they should

163
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,940
be more secure and somehow that didn't

164
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,039
work so we came up with a few

165
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,980
interesting examples I hope they are

166
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,920
interesting to you as well so who of you

167
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,130
has heard of the old TRO of the pen

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,710
tester that just leaves a few USB drives

169
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,690
at the parking lot at at some point they

170
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,299
have network access because people are

171
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,930
going to plug them in I've heard the

172
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:27,500
story and actually it has been validated

173
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:30,080
by by by by by the University of

174
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,559
Illinois I was looking for that and they

175
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,559
handed up about 300 USB drives and about

176
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:39,679
half of them got plugged a so how do you

177
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,309
counter that because the thing is most

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,410
of us are still really helpful or we

179
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,209
want to help if you were working at a

180
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,920
company you found a USB Drive at the

181
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,610
parking lot and it had a set of keys

182
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,279
with it and maybe a little toy figure

183
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,139
wouldn't you want to plug it in and

184
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,720
what's on it just to find out who the

185
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:00,490
person was to return it or if you're

186
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,499
really person wouldn't you like to plug

187
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,879
it in if it was labeled Bitcoin wallet

188
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:09,550
or maybe finances 2019 so as an attacker

189
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,829
I have a lot of social engineering

190
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,589
vectors to make it more interesting and

191
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,930
to get people to really plug it in and

192
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,160
basically I'm talking to a roomful of

193
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,800
security researchers or people

194
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,689
interested in the topic so who if you

195
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,050
wouldn't plug it it of course we would

196
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:27,939
plug it in but of course we think we

197
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:33,540
would do it in a secure environment and

198
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:37,660
we would be very wary of the device but

199
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,689
we build something that we call over the

200
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,290
wireless detention station the way that

201
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:47,050
works is you need to authenticate with

202
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,509
your company card and then you plug in a

203
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,639
USB Drive and you get all the files on

204
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,459
the drive you select those that you want

205
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,339
at your office PC and you click send and

206
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,619
once you're back at your office PC you

207
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,370
will have a link to network drive and

208
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,110
you can download them pretty easy why

209
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,809
did we build that we didn't have in mind

210
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,000
that people should be able to plug in

211
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:12,879
USB drives they found at the parking lot

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,110
I would like to acquaint you with

213
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:19,720
something that it is a story directly

214
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,839
from big companies if you're working for

215
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,579
a small company that's cool if you're

216
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,360
working for a big company that might be

217
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,180
cool as well

218
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,889
but both have their own dangerous let's

219
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:35,258
say and big companies like my company we

220
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,059
do have some processes that are really

221
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:42,670
really stupid if you have a closer look

222
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:46,269
at it so assuming I wanted to have a

223
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,628
presentation and I had to give it next

224
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,069
day and I worked on it yesterday and I

225
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,139
wanted to bring it to the office I

226
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:56,079
wasn't allowed to do that because the

227
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,269
USB drive would have to have put in an

228
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,500
envelope that envelope gets sent to a

229
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,490
different building in the same city

230
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,279
somewhere there's some kind of magic

231
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,480
would happen and they were labeled they

232
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,639
were

233
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
seal it and they would put it in an

234
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,589
envelope and the internal Postal Service

235
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,329
would bring it back to my desk and this

236
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:19,709
would take about how long what you think

237
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:23,939
three days if you were really really

238
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:25,619
lucky more often four or five days so if

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,589
you really have something important

240
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,300
going on then it wouldn't work again

241
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,670
assuming you have a presentation that

242
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,469
you have to give the next day what are

243
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,189
you going to do are you going to follow

244
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,649
proper process no you won't so people

245
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,660
would just pluck the USB drives into

246
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,199
their office PCs and just keeping

247
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,630
fingers crossed that everything is okay

248
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:51,149
but with building that virus detention

249
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,920
station basically what we did it is we

250
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,190
gave them the the option to have it

251
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,790
sooner and now you can plug in any kind

252
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:02,250
of your speed drive that you find well

253
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:06,060
this company policy again what do you

254
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,250
think happens according to the written

255
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,399
down company policy if somebody finds a

256
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,100
USB Drive lying at the parking lot they

257
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,850
should hand it over to building security

258
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,490
so far so good

259
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:22,319
what is building security going to do

260
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:24,660
with the USB Drive so the written

261
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:27,689
procedure is they hand it to the

262
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,230
communal lost-and-found which is three

263
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,089
kilometres away and the USB Drive gets

264
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,300
lost basically because you could throw

265
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:39,029
it away I still want to go there and say

266
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,639
you know I've lost the USB Drive it's

267
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,880
black about that size do you have one

268
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,350
and see see what happens that would be

269
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,769
interesting so we're still working on

270
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,529
that part the people responsible for

271
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,600
that said why this process is working

272
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:56,810
why should we change anything that's the

273
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,569
fun when you're working in a big company

274
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:03,089
but basically now people can use thumb

275
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:06,029
drives the way thumb drives are meant to

276
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,699
be used the next thing I would like to

277
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,010
talk about is fishing and of course

278
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:14,010
fishing is still also something that is

279
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,569
very effective if you want to get into

280
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,860
networks if you want to get people to

281
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:21,810
click on links and shop

282
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,490
into the audience which of these things

283
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:29,729
is malicious and of course it is

284
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,550
terribly difficult to spot that without

285
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:38,310
any kind of research link shorteners

286
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:40,229
like but we and Google and whatnot are

287
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,109
making it nearly impossible to see

288
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,120
whether this link is malicious or it is

289
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,370
you have to follow it and you have to

290
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,709
have a look and then you can maybe tell

291
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,620
if it's malicious I'm assuming with an O

292
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,989
with a zero as I know this is actually a

293
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,459
link that gets back to Amazon because

294
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:02,399
they have that Amin and this is the IP

295
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,859
address of our our own website so it's

296
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,200
and the last thing actually the first

297
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,329
thing goes to Securitate and the last

298
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,500
link goes to the slides so they should

299
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:16,439
be up tomorrow evening I think but my

300
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,800
point is we try to get users to read

301
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:24,060
male headers we try to get users to read

302
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:28,740
links and to interpret whether a male

303
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,810
was malicious or not and it's been a

304
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,550
long time since I've read male had us to

305
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,390
find out whether man is malicious or not

306
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,160
and Brian came up with the term we

307
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,980
should look for indicators of

308
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,910
because that is much more easy much

309
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,190
easier and I'm going to enter the

310
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,339
indicators and I hope you will you will

311
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,019
agree that if there's one or more of

312
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,029
these indicators in an e-mail you can

313
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,000
safely throw it away in a business

314
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:59,760
context because this is not going to be

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,029
anything you want to deal with first

316
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,939
thing as always is money because at the

317
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:09,390
end of the day people want to make money

318
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:15,120
and the scammers want to get your money

319
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:18,420
or this is the end goal so whenever

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,850
someone in a male wants money from you

321
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,769
then just get very suspicious because

322
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,839
why and it doesn't matter what the

323
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:27,930
context this just get very suspicious

324
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,800
and that's also for for private emails

325
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,910
as well Mario this goes together with

326
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,699
threats

327
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:41,279
so the threat is you could buy a you

328
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,439
could get an email saying we noticed

329
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079
that you downloaded this software the

330
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,589
software is our intellectual property so

331
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,529
you need to buy you need to pay us 200

332
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:56,910
euros and we will let it slip but if you

333
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:59,040
don't we're just actually we are going

334
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,160
to sue you and probably will end up

335
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,790
paying 5,000 euros so this is a threat

336
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,860
another threat is just implying that

337
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,290
somebody has done something illegal

338
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,360
because this is a motivator as well most

339
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,209
of us do not want to do something

340
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,009
illegal and if you get a mail saying we

341
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:21,529
noticed that you did that that that is

342
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:24,720
illegal and just to clean the slate to

343
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:29,550
to make your name good again you have to

344
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,410
pay this fair amount it's something for

345
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:35,849
most of us where we would react and say

346
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:38,550
ok are out of fear maybe I'm going to do

347
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:42,259
that even if I am not sure I get that

348
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,819
but the risk is too high

349
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:48,000
another good indicator of is

350
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:51,899
romance and I'm using the term very

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,220
loosely so whenever you get a mail from

352
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:59,100
a nice Russian lady who really has

353
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:03,779
developed an interest in you and you

354
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,789
alone then just think about the context

355
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:10,770
and think about what where she got your

356
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:13,740
name one of the spam emails I got years

357
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,619
ago that I still very very much cherish

358
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,480
in my heart started with them we found

359
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:24,539
your name in the database of real

360
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,459
reliable persons in Germany be cool but

361
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,000
flattering of course enrollments and

362
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,880
things like that and are good indicators

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,429
as well and one indicator that nearly

364
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:41,070
every time plays some kind of role as

365
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:44,370
well is urgency as for my example

366
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,620
earlier on you pay 80 euros now and

367
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,840
you're okay or 5,000 euros late

368
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,239
because we need to sue you there's

369
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,480
always a time limit like you have to do

370
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,640
it within the next 24 hours or 48 hours

371
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,580
but very often this is a very short time

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,280
living limit and that is a quite nifty

373
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:06,210
psychological trick because as soon as

374
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,730
you put somebody to a decision and give

375
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,650
them only a small amount of time the

376
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,100
brain works differently as if you don't

377
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,350
have a time limit because you you just

378
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,149
don't really think thoroughly about it

379
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,550
you think about the consequences what

380
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:25,110
happens and if the time limit is already

381
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:27,928
ticking then you are probably paying

382
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,469
it's some of them ransomware does that

383
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,260
as well

384
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:35,730
like just pay us within the next six six

385
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:38,670
hours or the price will triple so you're

386
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,100
not thinking well and all of these

387
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,190
indicators actually are for business

388
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,959
emails as well as private emails and the

389
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,970
next thing that's also a little bit

390
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,080
psychological and I still need to do a

391
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,870
few tests on that but when we read

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,040
emails or when people really mails they

393
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,620
want to do something with it

394
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,450
so either you want to answer or you want

395
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,959
to tick that box that you've dealt with

396
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:08,130
that email just putting it to trash

397
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,100
doesn't really satisfy that need to do

398
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:14,730
something with the email so in your

399
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,490
business context if you can put in a

400
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,260
button that says forward this email to

401
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,179
your security team whether your security

402
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,340
team is might be a secure operation

403
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,840
center or your main security team

404
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:30,178
whatever then somebody who got a fish or

405
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,709
spam I can click that button the mail

406
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,980
gets forwarded to the relevant people

407
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,460
and I feel good about it because it has

408
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,140
been dealt with and every social

409
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,370
awareness platform that does phishing

410
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,050
campaigns that I have looked at just

411
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,550
that kind of thing they implement a

412
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,409
button where you can just deal with the

413
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,919
email because then it's out of your mind

414
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,690
and it's actually a very good thing not

415
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,580
for the secure operation center because

416
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,010
those guys very often complain that they

417
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,449
get such a lot of spam it's not best BAM

418
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,090
it's the spammers it's going to just be

419
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,610
sent to them but on the other hand this

420
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:10,860
these are always fishes and emails that

421
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:13,439
pass all of your controls that means the

422
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,629
domains are not blacklisted yet whatever

423
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,090
the attachment is is not recognized yet

424
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,360
so it's a valuable source of Intel

425
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,970
actually to treat your filters so it

426
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:30,209
benefits it's beneficial to all our

427
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,650
sites and now comes one of the things I

428
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,600
really love to talk about that is

429
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,750
reverse social engineering and I've got

430
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,840
an example for you who of you has heard

431
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:43,200
about CEO fraud

432
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,659
so CEO fraud basically has nothing to do

433
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,960
at all with computers it's just a plain

434
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:54,690
old scan and to put it well it's it's

435
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,790
it's very simplifying but basically

436
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,950
someone claiming to be the CEO of a

437
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,070
company sends a mail to somebody within

438
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,500
the company and says you know I'm in

439
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,139
country X we really need to acquire a

440
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,550
company set can we make a transfer of

441
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,470
300 huh 300 thousand euros today so of

442
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,600
course the person that is targeted will

443
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,690
be in finances and they will have the

444
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,709
ability to do that hopefully but very

445
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,660
often there is again written procedures

446
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,910
that do not allow the person to do that

447
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,750
but what do you do if you get a mail

448
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:34,530
from the CEO you might act upon that and

449
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:36,600
if that goes on then basically that pupi

450
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,910
a person at the company will end up

451
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,389
transferring money to a scammer

452
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,809
because they've been socially engineered

453
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:49,440
the fake CEO said this had to be done

454
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:51,660
and they followed with it this is

455
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,960
something that sounds very silly if I

456
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,090
simplified and if I just say basically

457
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,400
somebody from the outset says give me

458
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,949
money and people in the company do that

459
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,720
but please bear in mind that Google and

460
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,150
Facebook helped for that for one hundred

461
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,060
million dollars combined and there are

462
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,830
many companies who fall for that in the

463
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,210
millions this is not a scam that brings

464
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,279
in a few thousand euros

465
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,320
you really if you do that and if you

466
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,289
pull that off you get millions because

467
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,029
you target companies that are picking up

468
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,970
one of the companies at the places where

469
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:26,190
I live that is Nuremberg in Germany fell

470
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,129
for that scam and they shelled out 40

471
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,440
million euros oh the good thing was it

472
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:35,070
didn't really break the whole company

473
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:39,389
but it put a dent into it into the cash

474
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:42,928
flow positive so what could we actually

475
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:45,719
do to make that better and another

476
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:49,710
company in Nuremberg came up with a

477
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,799
hilarious idea so they've got so many

478
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,259
emails with CEO fraud that they got

479
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,869
bored with it they really got annoyed

480
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,059
and what they did was they told every

481
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:03,299
employee you know if you get an email

482
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:05,789
just forwarded to the sock and the sub

483
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,399
would then go and change the email

484
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:11,759
address slightly so that is not noticed

485
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:15,508
and start communicating with the scammer

486
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:18,869
I would say no see oh very nice to hear

487
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:20,970
from you and you know I am not allowed

488
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:24,240
to transfer such large large sums of

489
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,460
money but probably you have forgotten

490
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,110
that we have this this very new

491
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,820
brand-new payment portal payment portal

492
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,610
yeah we do have the payment portal and

493
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,639
you can do all of your transverse

494
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,580
yourself have you forgotten your login

495
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:43,139
details and as a scam of course I've

496
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,519
opened my login details because I've

497
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:46,529
never had them in the first place

498
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,929
so they asked for user ID and password

499
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:51,119
they're getting it they are moving on

500
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,220
they are ticking a box saying yeah yeah

501
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,740
I've read terms and conditions and

502
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,279
everything's okay and they are presented

503
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,860
with a portal where you can enter who

504
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,220
should receive the money which account

505
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:08,340
and how much so basically is this camera

506
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,139
that's the check mode right because if I

507
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,059
can transfer the money to myself and I

508
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:15,418
don't need anybody else then that is

509
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:18,450
very good except of course um

510
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,879
it does not happen what happens is that

511
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:25,909
at the moment where the scammer presses

512
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:29,039
send or transfer the I then so the long

513
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,690
number describing the account and the

514
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,079
account name and it's getting

515
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:37,259
blacklisted and it's a lot more

516
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,418
difficult to get a new bank account then

517
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,759
it is to get a new email address I guess

518
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:45,539
this is something that most of you will

519
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:48,479
are creating so this company is building

520
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:50,249
up a list with blocked eivin's because

521
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:53,339
they are used for fraudulent purposes

522
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:55,349
and at the moment we are trying to build

523
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:57,359
a database on that and we're trying to

524
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,458
share the information but the fun thing

525
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,119
is if you're one of the good guys

526
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:04,709
trying to stick to GDP PR and you're not

527
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,359
really allowed to do that because you

528
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:10,669
haven't asked the scammer whether he's

529
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,668
okay with you using their personal data

530
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,589
yeah exactly and so at the moment we've

531
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:21,869
we still try to figure out a way how we

532
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,849
can share the data and make it

533
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:27,599
accessible for all the people who would

534
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:30,139
have an interest in that but again human

535
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,789
rights and other things come into play

536
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:34,939
the very good thing is at the end of the

537
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,469
day this camera won't have the money and

538
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,739
they will have been tricked into giving

539
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:43,579
out valuable information without having

540
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:46,289
anything in return

541
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:48,359
I'd also like to talk a little bit about

542
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:52,349
passwords I know this is one of the

543
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,119
topics that is controversial and that is

544
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:58,379
still something that we need at the

545
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,789
moment but still I think there's so many

546
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:03,119
things that need to be said about

547
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:05,849
passwords especially with this

548
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:10,649
discussion about passwords saves during

549
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:14,820
last one or two weeks I mean a strong

550
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:18,329
password is always better than something

551
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,820
that you can come up with but a non

552
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:22,619
security person can come up with if it

553
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,559
comes from a password safe or if it is

554
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:28,370
generated if it's generated and if it's

555
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,399
really really good then the chances are

556
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,439
that you won't be able to actually keep

557
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,510
it in mind especially if you have

558
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,520
passwords that are different for the

559
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,670
hundreds of websites and logins that

560
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,800
you're using so the left one would be a

561
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:49,130
very good password but do you know why

562
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:51,260
it isn't sorry no not because of the

563
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:57,410
remembering but it's on a slide that is

564
00:26:51,260 --> 00:27:00,410
being recorded but this is something

565
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,270
that most of my passwords look because I

566
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,860
can't remember them I've got them in my

567
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,570
password safe and I've got a possible

568
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,620
that I hopefully can remember to access

569
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:12,439
my past would say and even if somebody

570
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,030
is holding a gun at my temple in telling

571
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,150
me I should tell them my passwords I

572
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,100
can't because again old and I'm going to

573
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:22,040
forget them anyway so why do you have to

574
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,350
say remembering them so I think we can

575
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,450
agree on that what we probably can't

576
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,070
agree upon at least a few people can't

577
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:33,380
is when you when you're talking about

578
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,840
khalif's or empowering layer 8 or other

579
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,840
people who are not as tech savvy then

580
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,139
I'd like to take into account also you

581
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,959
Nam for example or your your friends

582
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:48,200
that are not online and all the people

583
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,929
who a little bit online every now and

584
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,630
then have a Facebook account or any

585
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:57,530
other account where they do a little bit

586
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,750
of stuff and very often if you can get

587
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,700
them to use a password safe that's great

588
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,160
then they should use a password safe

589
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,730
nothing wrong with that on the other

590
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,980
hand if they don't want to do that then

591
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,000
let them write the passwords down in a

592
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:17,240
little notebook the thing is we as an

593
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,980
industry are very very keen or some of

594
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,440
us are very keen to say this is not

595
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:28,130
secure and well if you have a look at

596
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,470
everyone and try to find something one

597
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,440
size fits all for everyone everyone then

598
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,900
you might be right but if there's a

599
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,330
burglar standing in your grandmother's

600
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,490
flat next to the computer flipping

601
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,050
through a password book this burglar

602
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,420
doesn't exist

603
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,760
because if the burglar is in that flat

604
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,070
he's looking for valuables he's looking

605
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,470
for money he's little jewelry he's

606
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,510
looking for other stuff and even if he's

607
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,890
flipping through the freakin password

608
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,629
book then you just changed your

609
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,480
passwords afterwards because you know

610
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,670
he's been there but there's no harm in

611
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,710
letting them write down the passwords

612
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,330
and if they can write down their

613
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,510
passwords then they are going to be

614
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,030
better than password 1 or 1 2 3 4 5 6

615
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:13,280
and all the other stuff that we see year

616
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,940
by year as the top 10 passwords in the

617
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:20,149
world so this is something to think

618
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:24,970
about if they want to use to FA or MFA

619
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:28,400
then let them this is always great but I

620
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:33,080
think we need to have a little bit of a

621
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:36,950
change of thinking and think about that

622
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,750
10% of security is better than 0% and we

623
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,440
can't get everybody to a hundred percent

624
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,930
or 99 percent of 98 so everything we can

625
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,090
implement we should do but if people are

626
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,190
not really interested in it we can't

627
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,740
force them to do it so let's find a way

628
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,380
how we can make it reasonably safe

629
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:58,460
doesn't have to be completely safe and

630
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:02,030
if you think that this is a bad approach

631
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,610
then please also think about that guy

632
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,160
who ignores the smartphone's security

633
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,959
and his role in the world and whether he

634
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,340
or whether your nan needs a better

635
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,500
security than the President of the

636
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:17,090
United States of America it's just

637
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,460
something to think about one thing I

638
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,770
haven't seen in the wild and there are

639
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,440
reasons for that is kind of a male

640
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,379
forward as a service again to protect

641
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,350
the people at your company you could

642
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,160
have you could register a domain that

643
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:37,149
has nothing to do with your company and

644
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:40,250
offer everyone forwarding email address

645
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:42,140
so the reason for that is your email

646
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,390
address if you only have one I'm

647
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:48,050
assuming most of you in the room have

648
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,730
way more than one but most people who

649
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,700
are online just have one email address

650
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:55,370
and that is the most critical asset

651
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,500
because if is an attacker control

652
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,719
email address I control all their

653
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,760
accounts because what happens if I reset

654
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,880
the password it gets sent to the email

655
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,790
address for that account and if I can

656
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,670
read that I can get into any account for

657
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:15,470
that email address if you forward that

658
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:18,440
if I register at the platforms with a

659
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,690
forwarded email address then you even if

660
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,940
that platform gets breached they do know

661
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,100
my forwarded email address they still do

662
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,920
not know my real email address and it's

663
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,080
harder to attack on the other hand there

664
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,020
are many problems with what if the

665
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,139
person leaves the company and so on and

666
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,030
so forth this is why we haven't

667
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,850
implemented it yet but I think this

668
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,070
would be a good idea even if you can get

669
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:45,500
people to have forwarded email address

670
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,990
just a real email address that is just

671
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:53,540
one more layer of abstraction that makes

672
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:57,620
it harder to attack them and one thing I

673
00:31:53,540 --> 00:32:01,670
also want to have probably most of you

674
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:04,159
won't be giving awareness trainings I'm

675
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,020
assuming but if you are working at a

676
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,990
company that most of you will probably

677
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,870
receive awareness trainings which can or

678
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,980
cannot be something that is really

679
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:18,678
really bad we do have something called

680
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,840
virtual training company and it's like a

681
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,850
flash game from the 90s where you have

682
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,540
to walk through a virtual company and

683
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,780
you see that bill is on fire what do I

684
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,020
do

685
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,770
well I go for a coffee I'll grab a fire

686
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,500
extinguisher

687
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:36,470
I call security so it's it's bloody

688
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,040
stupid and it's actually I think some of

689
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:43,010
the questions are just insulting because

690
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,649
yeah of course it's you don't go for a

691
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:49,370
coffee if there's a burning rubbish bin

692
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:53,150
but on the other hand I'm working in

693
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,428
various companies since 1990 I've never

694
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,550
really encountered a burning rubbish bin

695
00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:01,550
so it's it's not a use case that has to

696
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:05,060
be dealt with daily and another thing is

697
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,940
fear uncertainty doubt are enemies of

698
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,990
security in my eyes because they always

699
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,640
tend to

700
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,590
fear tends to be something that is

701
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,549
really powerful if you want to get

702
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,260
somebody to modify their behavior fears

703
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:21,379
something that will help you in the

704
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,870
short run until that person realized

705
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,059
realizes they've been tricked and then

706
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,639
they will show the opposite of the

707
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,379
behavior that you wanted to have

708
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:34,850
uncertainty is always bad and doubt

709
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:37,130
because you should make very clear what

710
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,830
you up to what people have to do or

711
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:43,460
should do and have to do again is a is

712
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:47,330
bad worrying because you need to get

713
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:51,289
them on board you shouldn't talk down to

714
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:53,418
them but I'm getting to that later if

715
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:55,070
you're doing awareness trainings don't

716
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:56,770
do multiple-choice click this because

717
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:02,320
it's always see right

718
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:05,149
somebody tried various multiple-choice

719
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,370
forms and the solutions and they always

720
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:09,799
take see and they never got a passing

721
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,879
grade but see is very open the option

722
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,089
that you have to take if there's only

723
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:19,460
one choice and nobody really likes to do

724
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:21,469
that so there was the human hacker Jenny

725
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,750
Radcliffe there was one of her podcast

726
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:28,069
with Tyra where they were discussing

727
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:30,139
that they would laugh if people were the

728
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,450
watercooler being excited about the next

729
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,700
security awareness training but nobody

730
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:38,750
is it's like yes the platy training

731
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:41,149
again today crap so maybe we can do

732
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:44,089
something to make that better what we

733
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:45,168
did and this is very sneaky I know we

734
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:49,460
didn't call it security awareness

735
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:52,069
training it's just different formats one

736
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,020
thing is called long night of the

737
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,710
sciences this is open to the public this

738
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,470
is every two years all kinds of

739
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,530
companies just open their doors and show

740
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,270
show up what they're doing and we

741
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,030
educated people that we didn't know

742
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,950
about password security and other stuff

743
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,460
just by talking about it trying to make

744
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:17,750
it interesting trying to engage them and

745
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:20,089
I recently learned that one girl now is

746
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,340
having an apprenticeship starting this

747
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:24,500
year because she saw us

748
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,210
doing that there so you're reaching

749
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,400
people you just don't know whether

750
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,330
you've reached them or not and you

751
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,240
should have open formats I think so

752
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:37,130
unlike here I mean please don't but you

753
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,020
are free to leave if you wanted here but

754
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,090
this is still a closed room if you have

755
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,400
some kind of open office space we're

756
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:48,470
just talking about security and chatting

757
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,120
not just one person just always talking

758
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,700
on the cells but having some kind of

759
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,890
discussion and you can come and go as

760
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,450
you please then people feel more

761
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,210
comfortable because if they get or they

762
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:04,399
can just leave and nobody bats an eye

763
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:07,730
and using multiple channels really works

764
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,520
well as well because we all take in

765
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,760
information differently so we are

766
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,530
writing blocks we are doing those kind

767
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,160
of moments where you can come and go

768
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:21,800
where we do discussions we do talks

769
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,680
internally and it's all different

770
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,720
formats the only thing is if you do it

771
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,509
after hours then just please don't be a

772
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,120
dick just be as nice and provide drinks

773
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,160
as at least and a few crisps because

774
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:40,850
people will stay if they have free beer

775
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:44,330
or got me bears maybe hopefully one more

776
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:46,250
thing that a lot of companies do but

777
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:51,319
only to a certain extent is stopping

778
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:55,070
themselves so very often you have some

779
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,690
kind of Ultima some kind of mechanism

780
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,880
that will scan your company from the

781
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,580
outside but very often that is just port

782
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,590
scanning right you check whether there

783
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,410
are new ports open or whether the old

784
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,480
ones are still working and that is

785
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,480
farewell map sometimes you even hire

786
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,580
somebody to do that but very often what

787
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,110
you're doing is not seeing the complete

788
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:20,480
picture what do I mean by that if you

789
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,580
are only looking at the network level of

790
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,650
your company then you will miss out on

791
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,480
the whole social media thing and you

792
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,090
will miss out on your users and what

793
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,610
they are doing on the respective

794
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,749
networks Twitter LinkedIn saying what

795
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:38,799
have you

796
00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:41,890
so what you can do I mean you can't

797
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:44,410
really marry often you can't just

798
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,960
monitor everyone in the company we've

799
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,180
got way more than 7,000 employees and

800
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,039
I'm not really interested what all of

801
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,190
them are doing on Facebook or Twitter or

802
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:57,359
whatever I would want to sleep very

803
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:00,339
quickly but if you educate them

804
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,369
especially with the top portals like

805
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:07,029
LinkedIn then you can have a really good

806
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:10,299
result what we had we about half a year

807
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:11,950
ago there was a person acting or having

808
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:14,288
a profile saying they belong to our

809
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,839
company and they were making friends

810
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:19,239
with our clients and they are making

811
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,769
friends with people working at our

812
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:25,380
company really working at our company

813
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:29,288
and so because nobody really knew them

814
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:32,259
our users who were everywhere

815
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:33,069
very good told us that there's something

816
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:36,339
fishy going on

817
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:38,859
so we were able to shut down that

818
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:40,599
profile very quickly within a day we

819
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:43,089
still think this is not an attack that

820
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,309
was targeting us but we think this

821
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:48,038
person wanted to look as if they were

822
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:51,969
coming from us and targeting a third

823
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,559
party which is in our case we've got a

824
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:54,609
really strange business but I'm coming

825
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:57,880
to that at the end if you're still

826
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,170
interested this is not unusual for us

827
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,049
that we are not the target but our

828
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:09,099
clients are and playing into this is

829
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:12,549
also cyber risk management so you're all

830
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:15,400
familiar with threat intelligence all

831
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:18,940
right presume so threat intelligence is

832
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,950
something that tells you interesting

833
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,049
data indicators of compromised about

834
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,499
attacks that are happening now or that

835
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:28,900
happened recently you will find out

836
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:32,459
about IP addresses that might have

837
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,979
attacked somebody or certain exploits

838
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,380
that are just running right now maybe

839
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:39,879
not probably not against you but against

840
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,599
that person and they are sharing the

841
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,510
data with you risk is a little bit

842
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:51,160
farther away from in

843
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:53,589
the terms of the timeline because a risk

844
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,230
is something that might evolve into a

845
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:58,990
threat but it isn't a threat really just

846
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,470
right now one example is if you know

847
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,790
that some of your users emails and

848
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,040
passwords have been breached on a

849
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,259
different site then you will know that

850
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,240
this is a risk and somebody will try

851
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:14,020
credential stuffing against your site

852
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,328
with the same kind of credentials that

853
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:21,009
have been lost on let's say yeah because

854
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:22,930
everybody was on Yahoo and this again is

855
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,270
something where you need to have time

856
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,640
where you need to have access to various

857
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,009
data sources like the dark web and

858
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,348
others and where you have to research

859
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,000
it's nothing it's not a solution out of

860
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,760
the box where just snip your things and

861
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,460
you've got the information it needs

862
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,990
dedicated people trying to come up with

863
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,960
the risks that your company is facing

864
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:46,259
but if you can identify those then you

865
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,369
can prepare accordingly and that will be

866
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:53,740
very valuable where the attack comes and

867
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:56,140
then finding the right language is very

868
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:59,529
important and it's short information yet

869
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:04,810
I already use cyber a lot and I've also

870
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:06,760
got a new teacher cyber mic and I know a

871
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,828
lot of the people in our industry do not

872
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,619
like cyber I'm sorry if you have to

873
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:13,690
suffer through that but as dr. Jessica

874
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:16,720
Parker said all of our clients are going

875
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,760
to refer to us with the term cyber and

876
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,220
if you don't go where our clients are

877
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,740
then we are leaving our clients in the

878
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,450
dark and this talk is about getting in

879
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,229
touch with our clients so I'm going to

880
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:31,810
use cyber because they are using it so

881
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:35,740
finding the right language this is an

882
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:40,540
example from last year's Def Con and the

883
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,959
person writing that got evicted from the

884
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:48,779
hotel very soon but after talking to the

885
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:51,730
DEF CON organizes the hotel staff was

886
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,280
there they let him in again reluctantly

887
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,230
but they did but if you only read that

888
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,230
tweet without being in the security

889
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:02,150
industry then this might be scary

890
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,450
because just a few months before the

891
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:08,720
treat shooter killed 58 people from his

892
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:13,220
hotel room so attacking people in Vegas

893
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,850
is a little bit of a touchy subject if

894
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:19,250
you just put that treat out then without

895
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,660
context that's bad and context is

896
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:25,160
something you need to give your users as

897
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:27,379
well not talking down to them of course

898
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,830
is the next thing because everybody

899
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,150
likes to be patronized right so we don't

900
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,500
like it why should we do it with our

901
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:39,380
police and there are ways of finding

902
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,350
something and finding how we can talk to

903
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,380
people this is another example where I

904
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,779
blanked out the uses in most cases when

905
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,890
it is something where I'm not sure that

906
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,619
it's still online and that was somebody

907
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:57,319
saying come on we as an industry are not

908
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:00,200
that bad right and somebody who is

909
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,380
developing apps and software said

910
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,180
personal opinion yes you are and

911
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,460
obviously outside of our little bubble

912
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:11,509
people really don't like us that much

913
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:13,940
but this is due to us in the industry

914
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,790
most of the people I'm talking down to

915
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,340
users for 20 years and it is changing

916
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:22,640
I'm happy it's changing but just let's

917
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,010
carry on searching for dialogue with

918
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,100
people instead of just you know telling

919
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:30,710
them what to do and what not another

920
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,930
thing that you can avoid is ritual for

921
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:35,330
rituals sake whenever you identify a

922
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,919
process in your company or something

923
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:38,869
that doesn't make sense and people just

924
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,390
do it because we've always done it that

925
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:43,220
way then just try to come up with

926
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:47,529
something that I'll say we don't need

927
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,529
that this is one of the examples I found

928
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,240
and I think it illustrates why it is

929
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,520
very important to understand the

930
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,229
security measures and where they are

931
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,660
implemented and whether they make

932
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,960
whether it makes sense to transfer them

933
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:09,779
to other processes in that case of

934
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:11,700
course it doesn't another thing that

935
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,760
might be more important than it looks

936
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,790
like at the first glance is locking your

937
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,599
screens so very often for a lot of the

938
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,160
companies I worked for they had this

939
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,750
very good company culture saying you

940
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,970
know all the attackers are on the

941
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,109
outside we don't have anyone on the

942
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:33,270
inside who would be a bad guy or girl

943
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:36,470
which might be right on the other hand

944
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:39,960
if you consider that I don't have

945
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:42,060
numbers from last year but usually a lot

946
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,670
of the attacks come from the inside as

947
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:48,599
soon as you don't call them it attacks

948
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:50,520
but also for a better world or

949
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,440
people just clicking stuff without

950
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,490
knowing what they are doing they are not

951
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,920
an attacker in the traditional sense but

952
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:01,069
their actions result in a compromised

953
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,630
Network so that makes them attackers and

954
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:06,359
very often if your company is speaking

955
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:09,930
up and if your company has interesting

956
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,700
stuff or interesting data then the

957
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:15,450
chances that you have somebody that

958
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:21,299
would steal the data if they are being

959
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:26,790
offered 500k or maybe even 5000 K 5000 K

960
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,240
yeah 5000 euros or quid then they would

961
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,210
do it

962
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,368
so mocking your screen and not giving

963
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:35,130
other people access to your mail to

964
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:39,150
everything that is open on your laptop

965
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:45,329
it's really important basically what we

966
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:47,609
are doing is amateur hour I get to the

967
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:50,010
pro version but if I see an unlocked

968
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:51,480
screen of one of my teammates I'm going

969
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,520
to send an email to the team saying

970
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,560
tomorrow there's free cake I'm going to

971
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,740
provide free cake or maybe a beer after

972
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,089
work something small something that

973
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,729
doesn't

974
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:04,369
costs too much because people then

975
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:06,769
follow up on it you know if you return

976
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:09,259
to your desk and you find out that you

977
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:11,930
promised Kate for 10 people the next day

978
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:13,759
then most people are not enough of a

979
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:16,190
dick to not follow up on that and they

980
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,489
will bring cake but they will also lock

981
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,979
their screen the next day or at least

982
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:25,640
after two or three times and when I say

983
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:27,950
this is the amateur version after giving

984
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,420
that talk at another conference somebody

985
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,910
came up to me and said you know what we

986
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,859
do we've got mattress rolled out wide

987
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,390
group policy so I only have to press

988
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,380
this and that key combination and that

989
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:41,960
my mail goes out automatically yeah

990
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:46,329
that's one way to do it we are not that

991
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,499
professional in that respect and

992
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:52,569
something that you have to bear in mind

993
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:56,660
is it's no use to have one dedicated

994
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:58,940
security person within a team and teach

995
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:02,719
them and give them all the advice and

996
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:05,630
they have to be the multiplicator and

997
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,849
get it into the team things like that

998
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,059
because it doesn't work you have to

999
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:14,839
educate every individual the way that

1000
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:17,420
works works very well for us is when

1001
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:20,029
we're doing trainings or giving security

1002
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:23,059
awareness advice we are rarely talking

1003
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:25,160
about the office we are very often

1004
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:28,069
talking about how people can protect

1005
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,069
themselves at home because people are

1006
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:33,019
more interested in that and very often

1007
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:36,349
they have the feeling that if they are

1008
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:39,919
at their office PC they are protected

1009
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:43,190
anyway because we've got lots of people

1010
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,019
doing security and they have the feeling

1011
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,309
they are protected anyway it doesn't

1012
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:50,238
really help when they click phishing

1013
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:53,329
links but for the personal life and they

1014
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:58,130
are more appreciative of what they hear

1015
00:47:53,329 --> 00:48:01,969
and so the whole education really works

1016
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:04,969
well if you educate everyone and I know

1017
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:07,339
I still have some minutes but I thought

1018
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:08,660
originally I was too quick so I I went

1019
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:11,830
through something a little bit faster

1020
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:13,029
I'm nearly at the end we were

1021
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,069
talking about stop focus at the

1022
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,750
beginning and I also have a lot of

1023
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,870
stockholders this is my favorite stock

1024
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,930
photo somebody used it like I've got

1025
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:26,109
rude yeah

1026
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:28,899
but what I want to say is we should also

1027
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,770
eat our own dog food there's nothing

1028
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,480
worse than the security team not

1029
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:36,640
actually doing what they tell other

1030
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,040
people to do and I've had that at my

1031
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,140
company as well we had a security team

1032
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,480
and if you wanted to do a proof of

1033
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:46,629
concept with any kind of appliance new

1034
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,910
software whatever you would get some

1035
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,530
network share at the end of the universe

1036
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,259
so to speak with no connection to

1037
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,000
anything and you had to be confined to

1038
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,890
that and be happy you couldn't access it

1039
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,630
really you couldn't test it really but

1040
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:03,850
everything else was too scary so imagine

1041
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,040
my surprise when I was invited to be

1042
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:09,700
part of a proof-of-concept for software

1043
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:12,130
that they evaluated and it was just in

1044
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,560
the office Network you know no firewalls

1045
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:17,620
no borders because that's how it works

1046
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,509
and it's much easier and stuff like that

1047
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,089
really makes me angry because if you

1048
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:24,010
have security guidelines everybody

1049
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:26,140
should stick to them especially the

1050
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:27,730
people writing the damn guidelines

1051
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,240
because if you can't follow the

1052
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:35,470
guidelines who else should you know

1053
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:39,399
makes it senseless so basically I hope I

1054
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:44,200
get across the point that it doesn't

1055
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,900
really make a difference if you own for

1056
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,370
some reason this just went out but

1057
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,280
you're not really missing out on a lot

1058
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:52,960
but if somebody from the technical point

1059
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,290
of view could actually have a look I

1060
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,040
wouldn't mind because I can hold that up

1061
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:01,930
but it's no use but this light says

1062
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,540
conclusion in cooperation at the moment

1063
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:06,819
my conclusion my cooperation is please

1064
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,130
think about hiring more people and

1065
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:12,810
getting more security awareness out

1066
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:17,380
there in a meaningful way instead of

1067
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:19,930
instead of anything don't know doesn't

1068
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,790
matter there really I promise you the

1069
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:25,690
slides that come now are really boring

1070
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:27,730
no more funny memes well

1071
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:31,240
the very last slide is very funny but I

1072
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:33,700
think but on the other hand we can show

1073
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:37,180
you you doesn't matter so instead of

1074
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:39,308
investing into new appliances that just

1075
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,848
give more work to your sock or more data

1076
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:48,309
that is not relevant just please try to

1077
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:49,930
invest it in your people and also know

1078
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:51,670
your threats especially know your

1079
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:55,118
threats when it comes to social and when

1080
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:58,660
it comes to other things that are user

1081
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:01,809
related and not tech related I've put in

1082
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:08,319
some links you can take a photo of that

1083
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:11,740
slide in just now but they will be bare

1084
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:14,819
with me my website is called cyber stuff

1085
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:18,939
Todd oh yeah right thank you very much

1086
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:20,769
and I will put the slides online as I

1087
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,700
said probably tomorrow evening and you

1088
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:26,890
will have the links there that's just a

1089
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:30,250
little bit about the stuff that we we

1090
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:33,339
have been talking about I also am a

1091
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:35,529
regular on send security podcast in

1092
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:37,990
English which is probably more valuable

1093
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:41,019
to you because I also do with the German

1094
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,609
send security podcast you're happy to

1095
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:44,200
listen to it but if you don't understand

1096
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:48,339
German it might be even more confusing

1097
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:51,129
and thank you very much for listening my

1098
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:52,990
name is Stephan Hagar my handle is at K

1099
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:55,059
if you want to follow me on Twitter I

1100
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,740
appreciate that you can have gummy bears

1101
00:51:55,059 --> 00:51:59,920
for that and that is a very cheap way to

1102
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,258
persuade you I work for a company called

1103
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,720
dot F in Germany and what we are doing

1104
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:07,660
is we are writing software for tax

1105
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,180
accountants and tax consultants and this

1106
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,368
sounds for everybody outside of Germany

1107
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,828
like something that is pretty boring

1108
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:18,700
probably is but it is a big market in

1109
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:21,160
Germany so we have 7,000 people and we

1110
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,109
are I think amongst the five largest

1111
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:26,680
software producers in Germany it's just

1112
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:28,960
behind Microsoft OSAP so it's a really

1113
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,680
big market in Germany but they say that

1114
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:37,010
70% of wealth literature on tax is

1115
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,890
written in German so they might be right

1116
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:43,340
as for the last and hopefully it's

1117
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,368
slightly hung it's like okay any

1118
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,369
questions

1119
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,209
yeah

1120
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,060
so the question is what we were thinking

1121
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,910
about Mach phishing attempts and social

1122
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:10,460
awareness campaigns I think it depends

1123
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:12,740
on the company culture and it depends on

1124
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,810
what you're doing the uses and what

1125
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,910
happens if somebody accidentally clicked

1126
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,220
clicks a fish if you're in the kind of

1127
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:22,609
company where that is very hierarchical

1128
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:25,129
and where any kind of mistake will give

1129
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:29,630
you the slip then this is a really bad

1130
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:32,240
idea if you have a rather good aware

1131
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:34,550
user base and they know that this is

1132
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,520
happening and you can gamee find it

1133
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,810
to a point where you can actually have a

1134
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,220
list where you see you're better than

1135
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:45,080
marketing or your department is so never

1136
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,839
go down to the individual just make it

1137
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:51,380
teams it can be a good idea if you

1138
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,930
repeat it say three times a year maybe

1139
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,750
four times a year not more often because

1140
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,910
that becomes annoying on the other hand

1141
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:01,400
I think and I'm a firm believer that I

1142
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:04,609
don't know how I can get there but I

1143
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:08,480
think a user at the office PC should be

1144
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:10,700
able to click anything they see without

1145
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,520
any kind of fear because it's the job of

1146
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,410
the security team to make sure that they

1147
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,990
can click anything without anything

1148
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:19,940
happening at the moment we have that no

1149
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,770
company because our office network is

1150
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,500
not connected to the internet so yeah

1151
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:28,880
click on the fish and that is why all

1152
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:33,530
the social media we have social

1153
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,710
awareness campaign people trying to get

1154
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:38,540
us to try the product and whenever we

1155
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,220
said you know we have that we have

1156
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,950
separated our network from the internet

1157
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:45,230
and B no we won't whitelist your fake

1158
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,730
domains because that is not the test

1159
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:50,940
we won't watch this the domains for any

1160
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:52,410
scanner so please try it in the

1161
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,210
environments with these constraints

1162
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:58,049
because this is how a criminal would

1163
00:54:54,210 --> 00:55:02,099
have track nobody took up the chance to

1164
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:03,780
improve under any other Christians and I

1165
