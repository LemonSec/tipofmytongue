1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,439
given the choice between being right

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,090
before lunch and right after lunch I

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,280
always go over right before lunch

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,719
because then like arrows really excited

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,250
in your talk instead of all I sleep in

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,029
it because that's what I do after lunch

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,340
so I have to apologize I have a slightly

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,189
hoarse voice my kids were sick three

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,020
weeks ago and still I have a hoarse

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,290
voice and it didn't help that I've been

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:32,210
speaking the past three day four days so

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:35,510
here I am this is seven armor hacks for

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:40,460
seven GBP Great Britain's I repeat it

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:46,220
today our own food bread with BP BP rich

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:50,440
pounds what in seven pounds seven bucks

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,750
seven dollars good work boys hey boys

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:58,629
seven good work points will get you a

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,250
bunch of hyrax so let's get on with this

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,939
where's my there's no my pictures on

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,970
here I'm Joe Fitzpatrick I do our

21
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:10,520
marketing and training and I have been

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,190
doing this for six years on my own prior

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,929
to that I worked at until the company

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:21,229
about the community and I was working on

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,720
a silicon debug so always use they come

26
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,950
off the line figuring out why they don't

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,260
work when they don't work and how to

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,330
make all's been faster from that I moved

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,330
into product security so I was doing

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,630
God's desktop and server CPU pen testing

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,630
pre pre-release pre silicon and masovia

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,100
I got more of that and wanted to travel

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:46,630
a lot more so I decided to start

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:50,060
teaching classes to Ron's and people so

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,439
Gordon and Omega and others have haven't

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,590
told me many times that I should come

37
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,689
here to degree station for several

38
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,689
layers and so I might actually be here

39
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,419
finally I just so happening tonight

40
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,548
class this weekend Edinboro so I have an

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,560
excuse to the eros excited it happened

42
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,119
to be the same week so I'm leaving up

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,190
were taking varsity this is right off of

44
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,200
a little search help thing that Google

45
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,329
gives you and I was pretty excited to

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,780
see notable alumni there I am right at

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:21,310
the beginning this is before I agree my

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,799
hair I actually have a Google Alert on

49
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,810
my name so I can see like when things

50
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:29,739
pop up quick and I get a lot of hits for

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,810
members of Scottish Parliament and

52
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,040
health ministers who have lots of things

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,599
to say about organ donation and

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,370
everything else but it's kind of neat

55
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,030
because you know Joey Joe Fitzpatrick is

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,459
always in the news but what I'm gonna

57
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,930
talk about is poverty and tools for

58
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,920
hardware hacking anybody seen this

59
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,730
before what is it who loves the bus

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,099
pardon I eat my spire can't stand it so

61
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,590
about ten years ago or so when it came

62
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,599
out it was pretty cool you could infer I

63
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,180
think it's 30 35 bucks I don't know what

64
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,649
it is in your money or we're not getting

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,650
your money in a month because who knows

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,019
but for $35 you have this little device

67
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,150
without a micro controller on it this

68
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,510
one right here the usb-to-serial

69
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,549
chip and then right next to it this

70
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,310
is a pic microcontroller and that pic

71
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,750
microcontroller would basically speak

72
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,250
all sorts of different protocols that

73
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,829
you might want to speak it could listen

74
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,750
and tell you a ratio of cable what's

75
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,220
going on it was designed so you wouldn't

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,110
have any software under computer you

77
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,769
could just use a serial terminal and

78
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,400
talk to this thing so at the time it was

79
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,409
pretty awesome

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,090
there was no other tool that would do

81
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:44,149
some other things for that for even

82
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,829
close to that price range if you want to

83
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,629
do anything anything fancy looking at

84
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,970
the signals or observe things you need

85
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,370
something like this fancy Windows XP

86
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,590
running logic analyzer right these

87
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,879
things are you know if you're a student

88
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,099
at a university and you have an extra

89
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,810
lab you might have access twenties but

90
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,488
if you didn't you had to beg your

91
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,379
friends or find someone I wouldn't work

92
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,209
or something else together your hands-on

93
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,370
with these devices because they cost you

94
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,209
know thousands if not tens of thousands

95
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,069
of pounds or euros or quid or dollars or

96
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,200
whatever but something on that order of

97
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,849
magnitude probably even higher on like

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,469
wasn't Zimbabwe dollars it was probably

99
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:24,289
like you know a few a few trillion

100
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:26,240
Zimbabwe dollars anyway recently there's

101
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:29,449
been these new tools these Sayle a logic

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,889
analyzers and this is about an inch and

103
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,139
a half two inches or what's that you

104
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,150
know five centimeters on the side these

105
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,220
tiny little devices they have a bunch of

106
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,679
wires these are logic analyzers that can

107
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,039
hook up to your signals so these things

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,810
cost closer to about a hundred dollars

109
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,659
right so we have a big difference in our

110
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,780
tools but still 35 dollars for a bus

111
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,979
parent it's kind of the best way to go

112
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,489
logic analyzers on bench top it makes

113
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,969
sense PCB ones suddenly sorry PC based

114
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,949
ones

115
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,710
suddenly make things a whole lot more

116
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:03,380
accessible so I'm gonna be using this

117
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:08,270
board for quite some time this is a made

118
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,710
by Adafruit and that's a company in the

119
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,990
high states that that builds these like

120
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,609
hobbykid puppy more things what's

121
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,750
important though is on top of here is

122
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,260
the FT 232 H chip right

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,630
and empty the company name FTDI 232

124
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,270
comes from rs-232 because these things

125
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,710
used to speak rs-232 and not just H

126
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,810
because this thing is the high speed

127
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,820
version and can do more than just parts

128
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,710
232 it can do chain ten again can do spy

129
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,270
they can do all sorts of things and

130
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,849
we'll see that they you can even sample

131
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,289
and output Dana and up to 30 megabits

132
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,440
per second which is would be asking for

133
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,640
a chip that cost at least in the US

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,020
would cost 15 dollars

135
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,580
who knows where it costs here maybe

136
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,690
maybe in here you can get them here for

137
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:56,650
under 15 euro oh yeah

138
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,690
so anyway I said 7 pounds that are 7

139
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,150
good point points right and absolute

140
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,730
more but luckily you can go to all they

141
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,560
express which is this you know warehouse

142
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,570
of everything you ever wanted to not

143
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,730
work from China or everything everything

144
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,169
you you would want from China but would

145
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,870
hope to be a slightly better quality

146
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,060
than their actual gonna get it for seven

147
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,100
dollars and forty four cents you can get

148
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,380
these things and like at least for me

149
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,090
it's dates until about six months ago

150
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,950
they're never there really wasn't a lot

151
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,330
of duties tariffs on stuff coming to

152
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,159
China I don't know if you follow the

153
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,380
news but there's a full framework thing

154
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,440
going on and like tariffs and all that

155
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:37,479
crap but I think you guys got your own

156
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,130
news to deal with so I understand so 7

157
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,780
paths have a good point points or 7

158
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,460
dollars you can get forward it's based

159
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,409
on the same chip and some when we talk

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,060
about things that we're gonna do we're

161
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,910
not dealing with the door doesn't matter

162
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,950
eyes purple or blue or red or anything

163
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,560
else we're gonna use USB to talk

164
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:57,370
directly to that ship and use that ship

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,260
to talk directly to tires right so I

166
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,960
thought it'd be pretty cool since like I

167
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,780
use this chimp so much I contacted FDI

168
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,640
FTDI that occurs in Glasgow so I said

169
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,150
hey I'm teaching how many have a

170
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,740
presentation at a university in in

171
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,539
Scotland and I thought maybe you guys

172
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,430
would donate a whole bunch of cable so I

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,669
could give him out after conference and

174
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,280
of course they said no and that's

175
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:23,280
okay well can you tell me the procedure

176
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,229
how I would request academic donations

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,729
in the future and suddenly that that

178
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,560
went down the right path and said well

179
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,960
we we can do that we can send you some

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,939
cables good yeah that'd be great like hi

181
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,919
leaving Oregon which importantly which

182
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,599
is literally 20 minutes from their US

183
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,919
headquarters and here you're an hour

184
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,569
from there you know worldwide

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,210
headquarters we have to figure out how

186
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:45,270
to get these cables right weeks go by

187
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,248
right I left and I've been in the UK for

188
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,960
the past week so I can't get them in a

189
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:51,330
month and they finally get touch with me

190
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,710
like hey you know sorry we dropped the

191
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,960
ball this you still want those cables

192
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,120
some I'm sure you know you can send them

193
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,370
right to the University but okay well um

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,050
you know we'll figure that out and they

195
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,469
like go back and forth for three days so

196
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:08,939
yesterday they shipped a whole bunch of

197
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:10,770
cables overnight supposedly to here but

198
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,659
they were supposed to arrive at noon I

199
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,460
have no idea where they're to end up if

200
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,688
they're animating here last I looked

201
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,989
this morning they were in stance an

202
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:21,839
airport they were also kind enough to

203
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,689
use my FedEx account number to ship

204
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,810
those cables overnight from right down

205
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:29,850
the street from my house so

206
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,380
you know we could call this a sales

207
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,789
picture graph TV acts I'm telling you

208
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,799
how to use their boards we could thank

209
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,610
them for donating those cables really

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,079
nice of them but the you know whatever

211
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,370
this is being recorded maybe they would

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,540
give me the next time and save me the

213
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:48,230
time so I said seven it should I adjust

214
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,469
microphone is that feedback okay we good

215
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,170
okay

216
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,240
and here are the seven scenarios I'm

217
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,209
gonna walk through so using an FTA

218
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,790
FTIL a pro logic analyzer with sing rock

219
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,710
or an ease that you are or console

220
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,110
access to go directly to talk to a

221
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,460
single core computer and then will use

222
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,800
it when those TV another tool that

223
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,690
supports this ft2 30 to show to do James

224
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,630
had control and manipulate the live

225
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,520
running system then we use a flash mob

226
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,710
for two things the first is to dealt

227
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,089
with the firmware off of a system by

228
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,560
dumping the firmware we can get a copy

229
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,839
of all the code running on it we can do

230
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,760
some offline analysis if without fancy

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,350
we can go and manipulate those files and

232
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,810
then flash them back to the same system

233
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,640
and put it up back doored or with Lucian

234
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,130
else or whatever you know fund something

235
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,490
more I put on there and in the last two

236
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,400
bits

237
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,100
we've got using it to do VIP I squared C

238
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,319
I squared C is a protocol that's used

239
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,660
for configuration of lots of tiny ships

240
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,200
actually the FTDI itself uses I support

241
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,939
so you configure itself and then in my

242
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,490
name crafting packets talking about how

243
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,350
to use this as well raw output device

244
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,100
for we can tell what the ones and zeros

245
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,900
would want to come out and write so I'm

246
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,620
gonna take a sip Waterson to my voice is

247
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,620
going great

248
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,750
this is a hoarse voices is an American

249
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,110
accent a cylinder so first we've got the

250
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,410
FTIL a the API holiday is a driver for

251
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,330
Sigma Sigma is an open source logic

252
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,189
analyzer platform so I mentioned before

253
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,940
we have those salient logic analyzers

254
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,520
and they're pretty cool

255
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,350
the problem is you know it's a rant

256
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,839
about more companies they have an office

257
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,910
of logic analyzer you could get 460 US

258
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,010
dollars with a student discount it was

259
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,810
four channels they did most of the basic

260
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,150
stuff it was really solid really

261
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,670
reliable and had pretty easy to use

262
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,260
software so what they do they cancel

263
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,459
that product and then they double the

264
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,350
price of all their other products so

265
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,150
their machine this one is $400 so how

266
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:51,930
many of you four dollars to buy logic

267
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:53,579
analyzer right now yeah so it just here

268
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,800
it bothers me because I'm trying to get

269
00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,000
people to start doing this stuff so FTDI

270
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,620
la is a driver to use this as a TI where

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,630
has a logic analyzer so what I've done

272
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,640
here is I got my board I don't have the

273
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,290
seven pound the seven dollar won't have

274
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,209
these because I have just tons of these

275
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,660
actually about 30 of them with me for

276
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:14,430
the classes I'm teaching this week and

277
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,140
we forgot a bunch of wires to this

278
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,170
header on vigeland on a Raspberry Pi

279
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,400
here so I took the Raspberry Pi just

280
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,990
because it again I have a bunch of them

281
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,280
has aids in for classes what we want to

282
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,160
do is what I'll listen to what those

283
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,500
signals are doing right so it's an

284
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,120
electrical observation room and what we

285
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,050
can do with the software is we tell it

286
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,450
to connect to this FTDI to 32 H and then

287
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,699
we go and tell it to Hampshire 1 million

288
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,470
mo this is actually the previous hops

289
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,330
reckon what we really want to do is

290
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,180
capture a few million samples at about

291
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,910
one megahertz right so we go click run

292
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,319
it'll go and capture data so we'll get a

293
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,600
whole bunch of ones and zeros if we look

294
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,310
closer at this data will see that the

295
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,439
day that goes up and down and

296
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,599
that state of being spit out on these

297
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,579
pins so now we can use the logic

298
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,749
analyzer to interpret and figure out

299
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,540
what it's doing what it's communicating

300
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:06,879
what it's saying I think now this

301
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,410
program is pulse view pulse view is the

302
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,879
front end the graphical front end to

303
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,230
sing rock so we can do this all in

304
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,180
command line if you're really you know

305
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,529
sharp I'd like to command lines or we

306
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,989
can do it with a nice graphical display

307
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,579
we can then go and use this option over

308
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,339
here because our protocol decoders right

309
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:23,769
so it's just a matter of details about

310
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,809
what these things are doing if we know

311
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,809
that we have a serial protocol we could

312
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:30,249
then go and apply protocol decoder and

313
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,889
tell that we wanted to code the data

314
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,050
here we want to interpret the ones and

315
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,709
zeros and zeros and ones and turn them

316
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,508
into bytes right so right now we have

317
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:43,989
the ability to measure a signal observe

318
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:46,389
and understand more about it this is

319
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,220
great for finding quartz than the chip

320
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,720
is communicating on this is great for

321
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,329
listening between two chips that are

322
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,410
communicating to each other it's just

323
00:12:52,329 --> 00:13:00,489
really happy to do so most of the water

324
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,469
I should you know drink we got time

325
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:10,629
already more to drive down so don't

326
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:13,740
worry good I should a chef set of shots

327
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,879
of whiskey right for the seven you know

328
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,509
that's good good to clear throat too

329
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,439
isn't it

330
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:23,230
yeah I don't know sorry so serial

331
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:25,059
console so we matter raspberry pi we're

332
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,350
just moving around and had a few wires

333
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,689
it just so happens that

334
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,490
this is your this is a serial

335
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,230
communication where the Raspberry Pi is

336
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,060
telling us about the boot process it's

337
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,250
giving us all the things that happen as

338
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,660
it loads the kernel those drivers and

339
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,510
then it shows us a prompt to what we can

340
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,939
do stuff so it is the exact same or and

341
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,500
we're just going to use it both people

342
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,920
to command money here we're going to use

343
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,290
it using the tool called screen is there

344
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,310
anything anyone ever used screen before

345
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,959
okay have been in the same way

346
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,839
everybody's screen to talk to a serial

347
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,300
killer before okay good apparently

348
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,680
screen also has other uses too this was

349
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,209
news to me a few years ago I have been

350
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,099
using it for over a decade

351
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,660
to talk to serial cables and then I

352
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,160
found out it has other purposes where

353
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,699
you can have multiple terminals and all

354
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,750
that fun stuff

355
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,880
but anyway screen and what we do is we

356
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:18,400
need to tell it to talk to the cable so

357
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:21,010
we call it dev on sonic system TTY USB

358
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,319
zero and we also have to have the speed

359
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,090
we want to talk we don't know with you

360
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,080
are what speed it's talking until we sit

361
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,330
there and look at it with a logic

362
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,190
analyzer which we just did so we just

363
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:34,150
happen to know that this is one one five

364
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:36,790
two zero zero bits per second right we

365
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,490
do that and suddenly we get data we have

366
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,490
text running right on the screen so

367
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:45,310
again sometimes you'll do this I know I

368
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,930
know straight twos I originally wanted

369
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,790
to do a bunch of demos with this but

370
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,800
then I realized that my time was kind of

371
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,630
limited so I just screenshots instead so

372
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,219
now I'm thinking like oh if I if I just

373
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,170
was about figured out how to get that

374
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,000
document camera but I'm not going to do

375
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,180
that because then you'll all be bored

376
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,590
watching me try and make wires work but

377
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,219
hardware is actually easy it's not that

378
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:07,630
hard just ask for em later

379
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,760
so what will happen is we'll run this

380
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,280
and it'll give us all the stuff and

381
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,770
finally the very end it may or may not

382
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,470
give us a promise to log in which is cut

383
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,920
off from the botanist so we want to log

384
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,860
in

385
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,650
sometimes it

386
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,080
a your route you get this little pound

387
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,300
sign and you get a prompt or a colon or

388
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,890
a spatula me and it tells you pay your

389
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,540
route you do it everyone all these

390
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,880
commands are available to you it's fun

391
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,410
times other times it's really obnoxious

392
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,120
Senate LOC to you and it's a different

393
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,140
user sometimes it's really really

394
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,520
annoying and asks you for a password

395
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,080
like what do you do they like I don't

396
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,610
know the password them you can sit there

397
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,040
and write a script that'll try under

398
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,540
passport that's no fun so we might have

399
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,959
to find another scenario another way to

400
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:54,589
get into a system like that

401
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:57,950
one option is JTAG so who's used a JTAG

402
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:02,420
before right so James had is the joint

403
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:04,160
test action group right so this is where

404
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,800
all the joint testers get together for

405
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,290
some action where they talk about how

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,650
they want to test their work so it's a

407
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,540
it's a - a standard it's designed in the

408
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,030
80s for more testing to make sure your

409
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,640
boards are hooked up together but every

410
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,949
device had a tap and a test access port

411
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,689
to use this more test feature so what

412
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,760
maybe factures did i've CPUs and said

413
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,650
hey we want to be able to debug our cpu

414
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,060
as well let's add those commands to this

415
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:34,280
interface so how it comes is to open OCD

416
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,939
so that's not OCD what you're thinking

417
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,920
it's on ship debugger right so it's open

418
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,230
source which means that if you want to

419
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,819
read any documentation understand how it

420
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,510
works at all you have no choice but to

421
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:51,920
read the source code which is residency

422
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,400
sort of so anyway of open OCD looks

423
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,219
familiar

424
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,420
we've got the same or USB cable or in

425
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,310
the system I have this little wire

426
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,410
harness I didn't cut the wires to

427
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,420
different pins this time right every

428
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,250
device has different debug pins that are

429
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,079
dedicated and I actually did Sheila

430
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,329
wellness when I had to go in there and

431
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,149
change some software configurations to

432
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,800
enable JTAG right JTAG is a debug

433
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,360
feature we don't usually use it in

434
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,730
normal operation we only use it when

435
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,560
we're testing it so manufacturers you

436
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,120
know like they really when you're

437
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,208
designing a chip it's more expensive to

438
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,979
have a pin and

439
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,539
to have more function inside the silicon

440
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,089
so they try to minimize the number of

441
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,950
pins so they have multi-purpose pins so

442
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,960
we told those multi-purpose pins to go

443
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,669
back into cheytac boat so we could go

444
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,059
and miss from our system next there we

445
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,890
go

446
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,230
so what LCD is the tool we're going to

447
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,299
use we'd use a - ax command to like

448
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,299
include a file in the first file we have

449
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,190
is ft - 32 H about CFG this is the

450
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,970
configuration file that tells us where

451
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,950
to find this FTDI work what can my sandy

452
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,049
it looks like and just some details

453
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,659
about how we're using it and next we

454
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:59,700
have raspberry pi Don CFG this is a

455
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:04,559
configuration file it tells us that we

456
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,330
have an arm 1176 processor and it has a

457
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,360
certain amount of memory and other

458
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,610
features so in fair telling open OCD

459
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,250
details when our heart we start of an

460
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,340
OCD it goes to our source our adapter it

461
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,720
looks around finds a device twice as

462
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,360
identified with a code and it's

463
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,679
recognized as a broad common part just

464
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,250
like we were talking before we were

465
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,799
talking about the less expensive and

466
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,419
more expensive ft 232 boards they're all

467
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,520
the same know of the same chip on them

468
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,299
right when it comes down to coding and

469
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,399
working with it

470
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,980
but we care about is the manufacturer

471
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:40,320
and so again same thing comes when we're

472
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,360
talking about using J 10 right we're not

473
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,760
talking to a jade Raspberry Pi with

474
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,649
jtech we're talking to an Arrancar arm

475
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,870
1176 processor doesn't matter whether

476
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:54,149
it's on a Raspberry Pi or a zero or

477
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,360
inside of a flip phone from the 90s

478
00:18:54,149 --> 00:19:02,189
which is where that processor belongs

479
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,110
but anyway we find our break points or

480
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,480
watch points we have our ability to go

481
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,840
and debug our heart now how many of you

482
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,200
have used GEB before right it is GB to

483
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,480
debug up process right so you attach to

484
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,060
a process you use genie you can you know

485
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,860
x10 I show 10 instructions at the

486
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,620
program counter look at the contents of

487
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,449
memory need stuff like that well that's

488
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,159
exactly how it would OCD work so you can

489
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,740
start up GP instead of telling it to

490
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,050
attach to a bid process ID number you

491
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,030
tell it to attach to open MCD and then

492
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,399
you're directly using your hardware to

493
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,899
go and debug this is your using your

494
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,460
heart hair JTAG adapter and debugging

495
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,460
the hardware on this little board

496
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,380
reading Cheers

497
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,880
so next flash wrong don't thinking

498
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,350
further so people talk about dummy

499
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,550
pheromones you know I just don't confirm

500
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,530
one we'll deal with it later like I've

501
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,560
scrapped the framework and really if

502
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,780
you're a software person your goal is to

503
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,120
get code to look at right if you're a

504
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:09,090
software person looking at an IOT device

505
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,770
or network adapter or a webcam or

506
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,389
anything like that once we get the

507
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,040
firmware off of that you've taken this

508
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,410
Hardware tissue and turned it into a

509
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,180
software issue right so I'm a hardware

510
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,610
person that means when it's a software

511
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,870
problem someone else's problem so I love

512
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,810
getting firmware off with devices and

513
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,780
handing it to someone else to deal with

514
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:30,720
so flash Brahmi is a pretty pervasive

515
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,320
tool it's very common inspiron most

516
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,240
distributions it can be flash using

517
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,149
about like 30 different pieces of

518
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,160
hardware so there is the FT 232 H we're

519
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,850
going to use we've also got a handful of

520
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:50,740
other devices made by commercial

521
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:52,659
like a maze SF 600 visit Eddie Brock

522
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,240
teddy frog assist uh you know if you

523
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,550
want a dollar device that does basically

524
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,310
the same thing that lets you talk to a

525
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,020
flash chip so we use flash foam in this

526
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,330
case we'll wire up this is a Wi-Fi

527
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,510
router I've been dealing with and we

528
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:10,149
have a CPU here it has memory and right

529
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:13,990
over here you can see my green I'll

530
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,810
change to then right here we've got a

531
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,090
flash chip it's a little 8 pin ship his

532
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,710
stores eight megabytes of data but that

533
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,169
eight megabytes of data is enough to

534
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,930
install to store a bootloader a kernel

535
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,400
the root filesystem and a little extra

536
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,800
space to spare if we're using modify

537
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,440
bugs so what we'll do is we'll click to

538
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,879
the pins of that Shin right we can look

539
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,800
for the datasheet of that chip to tell

540
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,340
us which pins to globe to and again

541
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,970
saying or say USB cable to our system

542
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,699
and we just have to use the right

543
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,470
invocation to make magic happen what

544
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,510
we're totally here we have flash the

545
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,420
home is the program where Tony to use a

546
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:56,650
specific program and it's the FT two to

547
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,790
three to underscore spy program so FTDI

548
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,930
actually makes a whole bunch of

549
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,050
different ships they make the two to

550
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:04,290
three two then four to three two and the

551
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:07,000
two three two and just matters how many

552
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,770
ports they have on them so I use the two

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,600
three two H's the cheapest and smalls it

554
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,280
only has one port the two to three to

555
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,080
Asian has a basically two of those chips

556
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,820
sandwich driver what makes of silicon

557
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,040
how the floor has forth and I don't know

558
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,970
why you a USB cable with four serial

559
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,149
ports but hey so the most actually I can

560
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,680
think of a few good reasons but anyway

561
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,180
and then what we tell to do oh we have

562
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,520
to tell it what type because again we

563
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,990
have variants of this chick they all use

564
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,030
a similar driver in and cliquey to

565
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,250
clarify that as a - 30 th version and

566
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,760
then we want to read so we do the - are

567
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,600
and the file we would write it - okay

568
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,158
flashlight it was

569
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,158
and this is this doesn't happen the

570
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,299
first time ever right it goes says Oh

571
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,700
detective Hart

572
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,490
we found a whit bond flash chip and

573
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:55,120
we're gonna pump it we flash never done

574
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,529
this takes a few minutes when it doesn't

575
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,389
work it gives you all sorts of errors

576
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:00,130
sometimes it says we found a flash check

577
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,508
we don't know what it is sometimes it

578
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,740
says we didn't find a flash chip but

579
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,240
whatever ten there's a flash chip there

580
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,559
and give you a lot of cryptic error

581
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,799
messages but not me to tell you what's

582
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,149
going on again open source tools if you

583
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,710
want to learn more about how it works

584
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,299
you can either wait the source code or

585
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,429
do what I do and took up your logic

586
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,629
analyzer to outlaw it works so you can

587
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,240
understand what the heck is doing

588
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:21,029
because it's hard to read logic

589
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,950
analyzers for me are easier to read

590
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:27,789
anyway we did it we don't we got our

591
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,169
supply done hurried out but again I said

592
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,759
once we get firmware we had enough to

593
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,039
stop for people make a deal with it but

594
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,049
it's still not in that lease for me so

595
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,049
what we can use is a tool called pin and

596
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,940
lock okay this is a great tool basically

597
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,190
if you ever use the file command file

598
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,220
looks at the Ruby a notepad and so know

599
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:50,679
this looks like a PDF or a zip or a JPEG

600
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,389
or text file or code or an elf and then

601
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,549
walk way so that walks through an entire

602
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,110
file and looks for the beginning of

603
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,269
files in different intermediate spots in

604
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,899
that file so let's go walk through this

605
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:03,399
and say oh I found a document Federation

606
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,439
of Lachman footer so maybe I found an

607
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,090
HTML file on there I found a copy

608
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,529
registry because you're actually

609
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,019
interested in those ones use a couple of

610
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,370
kernels right we have this header block

611
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:17,320
header image we're gonna break it down

612
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:18,969
and say go this is the Linux mips kernel

613
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,250
that's gonna follow me here and here we

614
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,179
have healthy and make compressed data

615
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,590
knowing that it's also makes me press

616
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:25,480
day that means that this tool knows how

617
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,280
to decompress it so there we go we got

618
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,930
the kernel press

619
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:41,810
like walk through and look at all the

620
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:43,610
details in it sorry it's a good thing

621
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,270
I'm not handing out cables because that

622
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:50,030
I have to delay them so LZ may compress

623
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,590
colonel we also have a couple other

624
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,570
things tell me here we have a squash in

625
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,790
Venice Anna jf4 that's two file system

626
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,740
these are the file systems out all the

627
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,620
details all the extra files in addition

628
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,450
to the colonel to make the system run

629
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:07,489
whether you show here is there's a - key

630
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,990
option and it guesses extract so I'll go

631
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,590
and extract all this cool stuff that

632
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,630
I've found isn't that handy so we going

633
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,429
to track these files but I chose to do

634
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:22,450
is extract the Oh

635
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:25,250
this time is off that's why I'm sorry

636
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:28,850
the clock on here is 10 times fast but

637
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:31,040
it's ok because we're doing good - II

638
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,330
extracts him what I'm going to do is I'm

639
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,860
gonna look at the squash fest file

640
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,580
systems and there'll be a full root

641
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,429
filesystem

642
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,629
so it'll have an Etsy directly and it's

643
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,000
like that see directory it's gonna have

644
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,890
a use of the files all the fancy files

645
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,140
are what modifies go and give us sales

646
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,910
privileges on this so who's familiar

647
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,250
with Linux ten knows what files we can

648
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:53,240
modify to give ourselves privileges it

649
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:57,380
guesses back the room where our

650
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,970
passwords stored online sister okay so

651
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,950
that adds a password of show some source

652
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,200
user information and NC shadow which

653
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,490
stores the hash passwords we have access

654
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,230
to those files if we wanted to we could

655
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,790
go - is but

656
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,230
that's no fun that's for people who you

657
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,210
know don't want to buy anything like

658
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,679
Bitcoin anymore

659
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,900
we're gonna go create we can go and we

660
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,270
can modify and put our own cash in there

661
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,780
we can press it and send it back we can

662
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,490
go into the password file and go and say

663
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,760
oh there's user I not a login it's user

664
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,830
but change users user ID to zero and

665
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,500
then when you login as user here's your

666
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,918
root but we're gonna do is we look at

667
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,809
this in in tab basically a whole bunch

668
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,370
of the initialization programs can't run

669
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,960
this isn't open wrt which is a

670
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,479
distribution of Linux caters

671
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,919
specifically for $5.00 and right here

672
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,460
might ask for a console

673
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm gonna run big log in fashion user

674
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:52,700
like ah let's change that let's change

675
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,860
that to - America root okay so wouldn't

676
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,620
it be nice to just turn it on like an

677
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,889
image ask for a console here is your

678
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,149
console it sounds like a good deal right

679
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,970
so what we can do is we can take this

680
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:10,940
file system these two old make a squash

681
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:12,559
address right so squash this is that

682
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,990
compressed file system we can't just

683
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,850
mount it we have to go and extract files

684
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,830
from it and then pack them up it's kind

685
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,928
of like giving a file you have to sift a

686
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,149
copy of your file system so we'll use

687
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,490
makes part of this and we use that to

688
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:30,559
rebuild a firmer image that we can flash

689
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:32,660
back to our voice with gosh wrong there

690
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,149
are other tools than classroom to do

691
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,610
this and actually this other tools are

692
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,490
in my opinion better than flash ROM but

693
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:42,799
everybody seems to want to use flash ROM

694
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,020
because every time you use it your honor

695
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,370
I ain't going back to flash around all

696
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,139
the time because it's always there it's

697
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,030
always on every disk Linux distribution

698
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,919
and every other like custom tool I come

699
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,668
up with I have to support and I don't

700
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,549
want to support my students

701
00:27:53,669 --> 00:28:01,820
I go so let's talk about writing

702
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,469
firmware it's really tough

703
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,789
basically we take the same exact command

704
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:09,389
line and change the R to the W pretty

705
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,309
cool right

706
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:14,908
say why are a single comes to same

707
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:16,979
everything we've just taken a dump we've

708
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,919
gone and modified it changed a couple

709
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:22,169
bits we packed it and now we're flashing

710
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,839
it right pops the same device okay

711
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:30,359
so we came back and what it would let be

712
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:32,129
for there's no areas same set up let me

713
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,428
let me clear up some of my clutter

714
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:37,379
so we can look close quite a lot more at

715
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,159
the system you'll notice there some we

716
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:41,248
are wires

717
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,579
I give us an income that's not factory

718
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:49,019
okay although I've seen similar factory

719
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:51,779
type jobs in sketchy hardware so what

720
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:54,209
happens is this CPU always want us to

721
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,769
talk to that flash chip right so in

722
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:58,469
order that make all this happen we have

723
00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:00,389
to tell the CPU to show back up right so

724
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:02,099
what do we do we want to tell it to be

725
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,408
sad just stay ressentiment

726
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,668
keep resetting it tells time sometimes

727
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,859
you're lucky to get a recent modern

728
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:09,509
digital that down the whole time well

729
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:11,968
the system didn't have that so what I

730
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,459
did is I will look to this chip I found

731
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:17,940
out that this wire right here is the

732
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:20,329
reset wire and I hope that over here to

733
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,239
a jumper where I pulled it to ground

734
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:27,389
alright and you know it's a little ever

735
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:28,589
raising epoxy not pop it on there hold

736
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,059
it in place because if you hear there's

737
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,799
something more than once you should do

738
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,789
it right right so hot glue that's the

739
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,690
right way to do it right

740
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:38,369
way better than duct tape and I also if

741
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,039
you're ever tempted don't use Krazy Glue

742
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:42,539
it just makes a mess of everything the

743
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,579
worst part is crazy little get

744
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,229
underneath these little pity little pins

745
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,450
and then the next time you try to use

746
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:49,619
your own pro clips to clip onto them it

747
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,450
won't be able to get around the back of

748
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:52,978
it then they will fall off so don't you

749
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:58,440
crazy work hot glue

750
00:29:52,979 --> 00:30:00,050
okay herb for a cough drops um anyway we

751
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,780
flashed it back

752
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,389
Cyril had a policy report right there we

753
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,520
can hook up our that TV on board to talk

754
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,470
to that we watch the system that and we

755
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,160
can see what we successfully did we end

756
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:27,860
up with a root shell simply don't get so

757
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:31,820
far oh excuse me next flash whoa I'm

758
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:34,070
writing with W now modifying exports

759
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,780
account configuration so I don't

760
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,629
actually have the photos with me here

761
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:42,610
because all of my sorority stuff is they

762
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,900
don't like ask at home in Oregon so I

763
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:48,620
don't have any surveillance cameras that

764
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,390
I can get a good shot so what we have is

765
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,520
I squared C configuration and if we look

766
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:56,180
back at this device or it'll look very

767
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,420
closely at the back to the eye board

768
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,190
right and we see there's this big chip

769
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,800
here that's the FTDI where we have some

770
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,990
LED I'm sorry crystal that gives it a

771
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,820
frequency oscillator we've got a couple

772
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,640
of LEDs over here oh then we've got this

773
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:13,490
other black ship all right look it it's

774
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:23,260
got six pins it does something right

775
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:25,310
this is a serial prom that's pretty

776
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,440
awesome right sorry

777
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,510
so I'm going to certainly promise this

778
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,820
is a no chip that holds a couple of

779
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,020
bytes of storage so that that class

780
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,149
shape you talked about before was by

781
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,030
eight megabytes this is like every

782
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,980
twenty eight months that's all what

783
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,059
happens is when this chip power zone on

784
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,940
it goes and talks

785
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:51,379
says hey Who am I and this chick says oh

786
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:54,200
you are a cm Jenny's cjm cu-ft - 32 H or

787
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:59,899
if your fancy it says you are a native

788
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,700
fruit ft - 32 H so when you pop it up on

789
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:03,018
the screen where you love it you're the

790
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,960
driver shows up and says you have

791
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:08,149
attached ft to 32 H it gives the name of

792
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,320
the manufacturer to Sam for release and

793
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:12,860
we have something like that is because

794
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,110
whoever this buff pirate like this boss

795
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:19,879
party is very similar to that's actually

796
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:22,100
ft 2 3 - oh all right that means it's

797
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:24,259
slow it can't do anything but you are

798
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,178
but when we plug the bus card in and

799
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,159
says hey you have a bus firing sounds

800
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:29,960
good right it says hey everyone

801
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,690
there's a little flash chip right there

802
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,269
that tells it it's a bus part right so

803
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:39,289
if you're a manufacturer of like I don't

804
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:44,179
know a USB microphone or something I

805
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:47,299
don't give an example tell me I get this

806
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:50,869
bomb USB device for that ft2 graduation

807
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:54,049
so I got a little radio dongle fur like

808
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:55,970
a dr. white right you would speak USB to

809
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,639
the serial cable that serial cable a

810
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,649
serial protocol to the actual hardware

811
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:03,529
but you about this device to say hey I'm

812
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:05,570
a Mattel or I'm on you know Sony or

813
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:07,639
about some other brand device I don't

814
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,820
want to say I'm an I'm not I don't have

815
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:13,699
to yah device I am a branded device

816
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,439
anyway the point being we can go in and

817
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,249
speak the protocol with this piece we've

818
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:23,450
got to hum this tool this library called

819
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:25,039
live and PSN see right which is an

820
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,919
abbreviation in that great for something

821
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,720
I don't remember what I never do but

822
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,250
it's basically they're after

823
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,170
as high as the interface for you to go

824
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,810
and tell what things you want to do

825
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,180
whatever you want them to do it so with

826
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,190
this we say over have my advice and

827
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,200
we're gonna set some hands high and some

828
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,160
things low achievement maybe this is the

829
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,870
wrong one sorry

830
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,720
they don't know I'm talking to the wrong

831
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,989
sign adamant order so we have NP s SE

832
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,990
and we have a bunch of I squared C

833
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,690
commands that we can do we can have an

834
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,460
acknowledgment we can write this we can

835
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,190
get acknowledgments we can read bits

836
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,990
right so it basically have an API built

837
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,679
into this and then it's funny this this

838
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,690
is to limp esse it's a bunch of rappers

839
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,000
and a NPI it's written by the same guy

840
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,480
who writes Ben walk so he really knows

841
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,370
his stuff

842
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,190
Greg Heffley you should follow him he's

843
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:24,350
like I think he's at dinner TT ys0

844
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,860
on twitter so you should follow him he's

845
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:30,679
smart and what we'll do is we'll say hey

846
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:33,230
we're going to talk I squared C and 400

847
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,569
kilohertz and let's go start writing

848
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,770
game to that or we need a nerf Roman we

849
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,240
have that communicate with that shape we

850
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:42,020
can change the configuration on my chip

851
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:46,270
and suddenly we turn our whatever we

852
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:49,489
have our our our our not half C n J's

853
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:51,920
MCU ft 2 into H we can pretend it's an

854
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,779
Adafruit we can pretend it is any other

855
00:34:51,920 --> 00:35:00,620
manufacturer that makes a board based on

856
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:02,480
the same chip and last thing that I

857
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,250
mentioned was that back at the custom

858
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,320
protocol who knows what mid-90s

859
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,580
[Music]

860
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,110
so up to this point I've been talking

861
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,630
about the existing protocols I talked

862
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,480
about mache tank I talked about your I

863
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,490
talked about spy and I swear see you can

864
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,650
go and like look for our time diagrams

865
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,720
an ideal scenarios we find chips that

866
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,550
support these protocols but sometimes

867
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,180
you encounter protocols that are

868
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,710
different rarely but you do and usually

869
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,680
when you're calculus because some did a

870
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,360
poor design job but anyway sometimes you

871
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,430
want to see a different particles so I'm

872
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,440
going to speak

873
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,629
protocol differently so if you wanted to

874
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,920
mess with the timing on your spy

875
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,750
interface and he wanted to start like

876
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,290
doing maybe even glitching or something

877
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,390
like that

878
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,430
to try and get readouts from uh from a

879
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,650
flash device right you would want to

880
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,960
have very fine grained control for when

881
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,109
your signals went to one or zero or

882
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,530
anything else so what we can do is we

883
00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:01,779
can use the bang mode right and what we

884
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:11,619
do the same using one GPIO mother's

885
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:13,480
children purpose input Harley so

886
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,700
basically we have a bunch of pins on

887
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,490
this device we can tell any one of them

888
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,259
to be an input or an output and if it's

889
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,828
an elbow we can tell it to be a 1 or a 0

890
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,819
high voltage or look voltage right so as

891
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:30,160
a great wise friend of mine once said

892
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:31,210
once you can turn on/off an LED in

893
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,970
hardware you can do pretty much

894
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:38,559
everything right so so basically it's

895
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:41,200
all a matter of timing when you turn

896
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,270
those on it's one off so the combination

897
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,210
of sending your Penn State's high and

898
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,770
sending your Penn State's low I'm sorry

899
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,530
pick high and him low

900
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,390
and do it as precise timing that's all

901
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,400
it comes down to right once you have his

902
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,650
ability to do this in software you will

903
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,769
have a little protocols at your disposal

904
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,769
[Music]

905
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:08,950
almost on so here we go seven sevens

906
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:12,339
scenarios one through seven things you

907
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,109
can do with a 15.7 could boil each board

908
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,180
or may eat a few years of their tea

909
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:18,339
arrow or I don't know

910
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,770
you can you can use a logic analyzer

911
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:23,230
with a software sing rock if you need to

912
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,020
on your console access you can use it as

913
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,230
a JTAG control access depot

914
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,060
kaalia chip right we can use firmware

915
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,270
dumping and writing reading and writing

916
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,100
to mail in a system and we can also do

917
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,380
some configuration is promising a

918
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,790
configuration of various devices and if

919
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,530
you need to you can always craft your

920
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:46,500
own custom custom protocol from scratch

921
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:47,940
in software very tediously of course

922
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,080
you're not doing this with just a piece

923
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,940
of hardware there's software that

924
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,910
supports all this so these are tools

925
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,920
that I use on a regular basis I find

926
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:58,140
them to be quite reliable each make if I

927
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
have my complaints about them I got the

928
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,368
same rocket open-source logic analyzer

929
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,619
framework pulse view is this graphical

930
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:07,830
front-end screen is this multi-purpose

931
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:09,210
oh sorry no consoles it can speak to

932
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,799
your serial cable

933
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,570
it could speak to you know whatever

934
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,710
brightness your cable or your go to a

935
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,830
few arts or anything else

936
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,930
open OCD is another open source to it

937
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,090
because you're on shape debugging it

938
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:24,779
lets you control the bugger with JTAC or

939
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,850
even sswd single our debug flash bomb is

940
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,070
the flash reading writing Swiss Army

941
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,170
knife it works with this it works with

942
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,600
commercial tools you can even use flash

943
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,080
ROM on your laptop to make rice off of

944
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,490
your laptop or PC or everything else

945
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,100
they walk it's a great tool once you've

946
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,899
got that firmware image to go and break

947
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,520
it down into pieces so that you can make

948
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,230
sense of it so you can hand off of

949
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,640
software parts to the software people or

950
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,290
it can just mess around with text files

951
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,779
and that's why your skills are like

952
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,119
money and lastly there's a library live

953
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,850
at PS NC which lets you have kind of

954
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,440
Python or C API interface to control

955
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,660
events that are coming out of this board

956
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,859
which can be really handy has to go into

957
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,129
the scenarios where you have these

958
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:20,340
non-standard verticals

959
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:23,040
any questions better manufacturer than

960
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,280
the one from China yeah I would have

961
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,070
been someone experiencing

962
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,920
probably when I were stuck behind

963
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:32,440
quantity from from Aliexpress I expect

964
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,430
to get my 10% failures an order from

965
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,080
Adafruit

966
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:46,779
if that happens I just sent them back at

967
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:48,190
the Seminoles there are my go-to tools

968
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,200
and that's what I have two devices I

969
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,780
prefer these and more expensive hands I

970
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,819
will say because I caught up an ENDIF

971
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,340
hey what about the thing I did with it

972
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,080
if I'm tailor the system and I want to

973
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,610
find a serial console on our cheytac

974
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,060
kids and they're hard to find

975
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:06,460
I would much rather take a $15.00 door

976
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,500
and why are not once and leave it with

977
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,930
that system and never taken apart that

978
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,520
everything take it off until my $15 for

979
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,500
a used on this board and this board

980
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,750
because I'll go back to that same work

981
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,580
you know in a week and have to go spend

982
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,500
a half an hour finding those pins again

983
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,660
because I'm really bad at documentation

984
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:26,650
when I could just leave that 50 probably

985
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:29,770
more attached even more so you can get

986
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:32,500
serial cables that just to you are for a

987
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,270
dollar to like there's no way then it

988
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,740
makes sense to ever disconnect Asiri

989
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:51,700
cable once you've got a connected

990
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:53,319
working in my opinion so that's where

991
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,450
you set me into the next level of

992
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,190
complexity right question is like what

993
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,799
happens if you have like I we don't

994
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,510
protection or stuff like that so again

995
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
that's where you have to find out more

996
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,110
about the check you're targeting we're

997
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,480
dealer with a spy flash chip right

998
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,280
that's an assistant and they've done

999
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,930
something that it's like we're singing

1000
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,090
to do is you'd like desolder from the

1001
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,529
system and you can read it right unless

1002
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,360
they're doing sexy stuff like a

1003
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,400
encrypting once ever on that well if

1004
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,320
they're doing them where's the key

1005
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,760
well it turns out a lot of the low-cost

1006
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,540
systems don't actually have provisions

1007
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,570
just to remove to use inside so

1008
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,120
externally so find our key arts and read

1009
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:31,700
it or use a logic analyzer and sniffing

1010
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,490
key reading mechanism basically

1011
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,410
everything has to well homomorphic

1012
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,020
encryption aside everything eventually

1013
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,520
has to be decrypted for use so sit

1014
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,170
around listen that one which i

1015
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,020
caramelize or to find out when you can

1016
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:49,300
grab the firmware with excuse me in

1017
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,300
plain text it's a part of question

1018
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,779
[Music]

1019
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:05,990
that's a tough question because so when

1020
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,910
I was doing consulting like be presented

1021
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,859
with a board and how to get something to

1022
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:13,790
work on it and how can I don't do that

1023
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,740
anymore and I just teach I go and grab

1024
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:18,009
dozen boards and I picked the words very

1025
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,009
easy

1026
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:22,700
I've gotten really good at picking ones

1027
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,650
that I know JTACs don't work on because

1028
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,810
I want a good example of having a burger

1029
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:30,020
so I would guess when it comes to like

1030
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:33,560
Brenda a selection of like off-the-shelf

1031
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,080
networking equipment right I would be I

1032
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,180
can't I can't guess what I am finding is

1033
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,819
more often devices and actually have

1034
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,710
JTAG disabled it's how much it before

1035
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,390
sometimes that means that in grammar on

1036
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,080
it sometimes that means that got the

1037
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,359
traces or traces on but even if they did

1038
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,160
there's often ways to restore that

1039
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,400
sometimes I actually use this to should

1040
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:01,850
prevent JTAG so actually I was dealing

1041
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:04,070
with a PLC and they have an XP LPC our

1042
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,540
microcontroller on it and that's the

1043
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,750
court of code we don't protection and

1044
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:12,020
cheytac disabling didn't use it

1045
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,370
so yeah whatever but if they had you

1046
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,230
don't even go down the path of more

1047
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,970
invasive are more attacks bleaching or

1048
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,280
otherwise messing with the system to get

1049
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:29,299
that back that device to give up its

1050
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:30,920
code pretty good for lunch everything if

1051
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,780
you just stop asking questions we can

1052
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,250
even sooner

1053
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,990
thank you very much for having me and I

1054
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:40,640
am delighted to finally make it to a

1055
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:42,740
secure airtight so please find me ask me

1056
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,620
questions I also have a lot of stickers

1057
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:49,790
with me today read the big half of the

1058
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:53,870
Bloomberg article no super mario havend

1059
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:55,550
it's pretty pricey sighs amen so what uh

1060
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:59,930
yeah how much if I want to believe

1061
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:02,110
sinners coming out see for those thank

1062
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,109
you again
