1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,340
oh yes hello I hope you're all feeling

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:14,769
nice and refreshed after lunch not

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:17,050
falling asleep too much so I'm Graham

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:19,300
Sullivan's you've probably seen me here

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,530
before I've spoke this is my seventh

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:29,950
talk in a row and I've been here eight

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:32,619
years ago previously I was at populous

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:36,640
Cisco recently moved over to destitute

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,129
research and innovation I spend a lot of

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,359
time at home tinkering with electronic

11
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:45,579
stuff I find it quite fun I like keep a

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,909
bit of a primer for folks who perhaps

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:52,839
when I get into electronics and have a

14
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:57,608
chance yet maybe wondering how to get

15
00:00:52,839 --> 00:01:00,510
started I tweet a lot so if you want to

16
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:05,320
follow me see some balloons

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,950
so why hardware so obviously this is a

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,750
security conference and people like to

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,180
mess up with IOT and things like that

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,009
but I think it's interesting to get into

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,360
hardware not just because of that book

22
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,270
because you can just build really

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,500
interesting stuff I like playing around

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:25,329
with stage lighting so I built some

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,180
stuff to control safe lighting oops

26
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:29,559
sorry I just called on button to control

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,000
to safe flight in I like building

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,799
there's lots of LEDs so I've got some

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,329
sticks with like 200 LEDs on the beach

30
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,039
and you can control them Bob Wi-Fi

31
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:41,279
I think it's fun to play with hot air of

32
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,149
course on the on the work side of things

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,420
breaking hardware stuff is also

34
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:47,950
something I do is pop my job as useful

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,570
to be able to take some sort of board

36
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,060
apart and understand what it does just

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,428
by looking at it goofy part numbers and

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,310
things like that so are we talking a

39
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,929
little bit about doing that's one so

40
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,570
this talk outline we're gonna go over

41
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:05,380
some basic physics

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,820
I'll keep it light it's just the very

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,429
basic things that you need to know to

44
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,739
sort of understand how electricity works

45
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,019
really and then we're going over some

46
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,040
safety quickly just because I don't want

47
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,370
any of you coming away from here

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,230
thinking oh yeah

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,730
electricity works I should go tech pop

50
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,060
this CRT monitor and I'll poke around

51
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,459
inside no don't do that we're gonna go

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,709
over some common components that you'll

53
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:33,080
see on boards what they do and yeah what

54
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,910
circuit diagrams look like and what PCBs

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,360
look like and how you can interpret them

56
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,489
and what kind of thing some stuff about

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,250
logic so digital logic and how that

58
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:45,680
works in electronics processes and

59
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,390
different types of them interfaces that

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,940
those processes used to talk to other

61
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,359
things some tools that you might want to

62
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,260
take a look at and maybe get hold of

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,200
some options that you've got there and

64
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,298
at the end and I put a slide with a big

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,069
resource dump that you can then run the

66
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,360
mean reading them out you can just take

67
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,170
a photo with your phone or something and

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,799
then go

69
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,298
think through that on your own time so

70
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,440
it starts off with some physics because

71
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,510
of course that's what you want to do it

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,920
what 3 o'clock in the afternoon right

73
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,819
footage some sorts and definitions

74
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,910
voltage measure involves we get

75
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,170
different symbols different letters to

76
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,440
describe these different sort of

77
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,309
parameters for some reason we use I for

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,190
current because resistance measurement

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,660
knows and power less than what's now

80
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,900
you've all heard of voltage voltages

81
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,389
don't exist in the absolute the voltage

82
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,590
is a sort of energy difference so when

83
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,040
we talk about voltage we're talking

84
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,120
about the voltage between two points so

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,450
for example if you've got a nine volt

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,090
battery there's no sort of magic 9 volts

87
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,888
that exists what it is is a voltage

88
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,329
between those two terminals on the on

89
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:07,359
the primary this is quite a sort of

90
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:11,060
famous diagram of how voltage and

91
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:13,310
current and resistance sort of all fit

92
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,109
together so but it is kind of like the

93
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,620
force that pushes things along ocean

94
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:20,209
currents along the more voltage you got

95
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,250
the more current that is likely to flow

96
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,580
because of that resistance tries to stop

97
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,770
action so current it's sort of driven by

98
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,789
how much voltage you've got in the first

99
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,680
place and the more resistance you've got

100
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,320
than s current flow so they sort of the

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,640
the voltage and resistance are kind of

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,250
up odds of at odds with each other

103
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,950
so we describe that in maths using this

104
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,250
thing called Ohm's law so if you look at

105
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:50,070
this you see that so the voltage is

106
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:55,680
pushing and the resistance in ohms

107
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:57,270
modular homes is resisting so high

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,490
currents the amount of current that

109
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,060
flows through a circuit is equal to the

110
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,310
voltage of that circuit divided by the

111
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,590
resistance of that circuit and then

112
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,270
using basic algebra still remains that

113
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,159
so if you know any of the other two you

114
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,130
can work it out so for example if you

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,120
know that you've got a device that is

116
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,710
being supplied with the particular

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,820
voltage and you know how much current is

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,989
going through that you can work out what

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,110
that resists the resistance of that

120
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,190
devices and since the same with if you

121
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,810
know how much current is flowing and you

122
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,010
know what the resistance is you can work

123
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,150
out what the voltages I'm going to

124
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,080
quickly go over power but we're not

125
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,250
gonna talk about that too much in this

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,620
talk power is the product of voltage and

127
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,790
current power is literally the amount of

128
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,790
energy consumed by thing in in one

129
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,740
second so one what is one Joule per

130
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,070
second so if you got a 60 watt like one

131
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:54,630
that's turning 60 watts of electrical

132
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:59,090
energy into so 60 joules of electrical

133
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:02,909
energy into light and heat every second

134
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,679
these are just other ways to state it

135
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,760
again it's just algebra at the bottom

136
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,410
you might note this one is slightly

137
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,360
different because we can plug up Ohm's

138
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,770
law into this it turns out that if

139
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,090
you've got a device that you know the

140
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,590
resistance of and you know how much

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,000
current is flowing through it you can

142
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,280
work out the power without needing to

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,300
know the voltage it's quite useful but

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,580
we're not really gonna touch on this too

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,680
much it's just you know about safety how

146
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,180
many of you have heard the phrase it's

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,840
not the vaults that kill you it's the

148
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,940
apps I hate this advice I get told by

149
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,200
electronics people that is correct but I

150
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,090
know it's correct but it's terrible

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,240
terrible advice because without context

152
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,830
most of the time this this advice is

153
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,910
given is to people who don't really

154
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,400
understand electricity

155
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,100
that much and this on its own is really

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,630
misleading because which of these two

157
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,440
power supplies is more likely to kill

158
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:57,870
you but one with lots of amps or the one

159
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:01,050
with lots of volts the answer is the one

160
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,260
with lots of volts so electric shocks

161
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,180
human body resistance in the worst case

162
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,020
if you've got like a cuts and you've got

163
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,060
wet hands and you know it's on a bad day

164
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,710
it's down and around the 500 ohms range

165
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,960
of 150 thousand ohms the lethal current

166
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,150
that is how much current needs to flow

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,590
through your body in order to cause

168
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,799
fibrillation basically to stop your

169
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,070
heart it's about 100 to 200 milliamps so

170
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
the point 1 to point 2 of them using

171
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,390
Ohm's law you can workout that

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,000
effectively about 50 volts is enough to

173
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,960
kill you in the worst case but you're

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,030
probably thinking hang on a minute I've

175
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,640
shot myself on the mains before I hurt

176
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,950
so I help and get there the devil didn't

177
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,380
kill me it's way higher than 50 bullets

178
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,300
well that's because generally dry human

179
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,830
body resistance is much higher so if

180
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,840
you've got dry hands on you - catch

181
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,070
yourself on the mains you're more likely

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,479
to be around 10,000 to 100,000 ohms and

183
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,510
again if you put those numbers in like

184
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,880
23 clamps which is much love and less

185
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:07,099
like to kill you still obviously do

186
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,480
something comes with it but yeah so

187
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,240
these are sort of the approximate shop

188
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,610
thresholds yes there's a difference

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,030
between AC and DC the reason for this is

190
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,460
that your nerves work on work on

191
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,390
electrical impulse impulses now DC is

192
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,130
just a constant currently plugged AC is

193
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,990
kind of like turning it on and off very

194
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,280
very very very quickly and your nerves

195
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,680
respond to changes in voltage so because

196
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,020
the AC is like turning it on and off

197
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,339
very very very quickly it makes it much

198
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,429
harder for your muscles to sort of calm

199
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:47,800
safe for that voltage flow so AC can

200
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:50,109
cause your chest muscles to compress so

201
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,930
much that you can't breathe and you'll

202
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,380
suffocate so basically don't FAQ about

203
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,380
with main stuff but while it's on

204
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:04,060
because it's a terrible idea is is it

205
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:07,560
talks in here maybe not but he suggests

206
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:16,050
some alternative names for some of these

207
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,050
quite amusing that try to avoid silence

208
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,860
so it's the voltage that usually decides

209
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,610
your fate

210
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,680
so it is the ABS that kill you because

211
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,290
it's how many amps flow through your

212
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,579
body that determines whether you live or

213
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,810
die but what determines how much current

214
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,710
flows through you is how much multi

215
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,510
you've got in the first place so it's

216
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,410
important to like one last thing here

217
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,470
three things that you should never take

218
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,819
apart microwaves they've got a big

219
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,860
transformer in them they step the

220
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,140
voltage up to several thousand volts and

221
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,020
you took that you're probably dead CRT

222
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,090
anything with a CRT monitor I know some

223
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,790
of you quite young and probably I've

224
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,990
never even seen a CRT monitor but yet

225
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,640
don't take those apart that's a terrible

226
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,010
idea because they've got that you don't

227
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,350
wake up to about 14,000 volts on the

228
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,970
electron gun on that they will kill you

229
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,430
and third what is anything to do with

230
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:14,080
driving neon lights near the house of

231
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,390
the six kilowatt power supply show

232
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,300
dominicano that's a igneel light driver

233
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,480
don't take those apart other than that

234
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,949
you're mostly okay but try to stick to

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,350
the non main stuff stuff that sits

236
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,890
around flying to 12 maybe 19 ish holds

237
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:33,930
you mostly safe so we're gonna talk

238
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:38,350
about components so the things that make

239
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,469
up an electronic circuit there's two

240
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,900
main categories of component passives

241
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,640
and actives if you ask me to describe

242
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,030
the difference between passive and

243
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,250
active

244
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,050
I'd tends to two ways of looking at it

245
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,700
one of them is the

246
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,729
signal definition I see your lack of

247
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,470
either the physical definition is a

248
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,540
massive pain in the ass to understand

249
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,339
and not very intuitive effectively what

250
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,370
one of the main things is that our

251
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,339
active components can amplify power and

252
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,290
passive ones can't but then there's some

253
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,060
gray area around that it's a solute one

254
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,189
don't worry about it too much we'll talk

255
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,109
about it a little bit more in a minute

256
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,790
passives here you can see on the Left

257
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,370
these are all surface amount you might

258
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,719
be more familiar with components that

259
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,920
have actually got leaves coming off them

260
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,510
but in most things that you take about

261
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,800
the tech part these days they're all

262
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,470
gonna be serviced over components rather

263
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,819
than through whole so these are

264
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,040
resistors they're usually black

265
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,390
sometimes blue if they're like a special

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,510
precision resistors but they know that

267
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,819
using those numbers on top these are

268
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,079
capacitors they usually Brown and it's

269
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,490
also capacitors very different type

270
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,719
they've got these little cans sometimes

271
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,000
in things like power supply to see much

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,690
bigger fasters so resistors we mentioned

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,730
resistance already mentioned Ohm's law

274
00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:00,300
resistors effectively limit the flow of

275
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,459
current at a good description you

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,329
probably so this little zigzag thing

277
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,760
that's the symbol for a resistor in a

278
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:10,589
circuit diagram there's also an

279
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,899
american-style symbol which is actually

280
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:19,920
just a box because you know it's easier

281
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:20,970
for them to understand it's not so I

282
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,709
think some point you might see a

283
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,829
resistor used is let's say you want to

284
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:27,060
power an LED off a 9-volt battery you

285
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,979
stick an LED directly over a normal

286
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,689
battery and it's going to go very very

287
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,300
bright then as we go very very dim then

288
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,410
it can go very very smoky because what's

289
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,910
happening there is because the voltage

290
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,899
is so high the LED pulls a lot of

291
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,360
current

292
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,100
too much current and therefore too much

293
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,740
power which gets dissipated as heat and

294
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,449
then it catches fire so what you

295
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,699
generally usually put a current limiting

296
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:54,000
resistor in series with that to ensure

297
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:56,310
that the LED can run at lower voltage

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,320
because an LED yomi usually likes about

299
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,189
two and a half to three and a half volts

300
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,470
depending on the LED capacitors

301
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,020
think of them like really really tiny

302
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,810
rechargeable batteries they can't store

303
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,360
much much energy but you can charge them

304
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,890
and empty them fairly quickly and you

305
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,300
can do that many many many many times

306
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,970
unlike a battery where you know

307
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,589
rechargeable battery recharging 10 20 30

308
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,290
times at least with the old-school

309
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,520
batteries and they stopped working but

310
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,270
they take a very long time so charge

311
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,370
like lipo batteries and things like that

312
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:32,130
you often see them in power stuff they

313
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:40,320
used in a lot of things that filters

314
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:41,760
radiofrequency stuff but mostly what we

315
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,760
really care about one way of sort of

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,640
taking things apart that mostly use the

317
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,189
power stuff that we tend to be looking

318
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,800
at so they're mentioning the capacitance

319
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,350
is measured in farad's you will very

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,319
rarely see a capacitor that has a

321
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,640
capacitance more than farad or even

322
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,630
anywhere near a farad because a ferret

323
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,949
is quite a lot talking there remain

324
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,640
capacitors for that know generally you

325
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,580
looking more around the sort of like

326
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:14,069
micro farad's range maybe a couple of

327
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,200
millions so ceramic capacitors or those

328
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,110
Mo's mlcc's and multi-layer ceramic

329
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,400
capacitors these are smaller devices

330
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,280
they've got very small capacitance

331
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,880
anywhere from you know that the bigger

332
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,790
ones are in like the one the single

333
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,670
digit micro farad's they go all the way

334
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,160
down to like Pico farad's very very very

335
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,540
small amount of capacitance they're

336
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,370
nonpolar you can connect them in either

337
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,620
direction there's no requirement to have

338
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,730
a positive voltage across it in one

339
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,180
particular direction or the other

340
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,580
ah the other type is electrolytic so if

341
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,140
you remember on the slide before the

342
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,450
other two types of capacitors the mlcc's

343
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,660
ones on the left one of the like ants on

344
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,820
the right those are electrolytic

345
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,260
capacitors are these are polar which

346
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,700
means that if you put them if you

347
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,980
connect them over a voltage source in

348
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,760
the wrong direction they know what or

349
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,770
does not work they store more

350
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,930
capacitance they've got they've got more

351
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:13,209
customs that you generally get up to

352
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,959
hundreds of micro farad's or even a few

353
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:18,219
ferrets and most of them even go be

354
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,618
bigger than that but you generally let's

355
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,600
in in most most types advices now you

356
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:28,089
might be thinking well why even bother

357
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,240
with the the little ones if you can have

358
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:33,699
the big ones well they're not perfectly

359
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,079
conductive they actually have an

360
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,819
internal resistance there this thing

361
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:40,748
called ESR which is called an equivalent

362
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:42,878
series resistance what that means is

363
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:45,160
they can only charge up and discharge at

364
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,449
a certain speed because there's a limit

365
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,219
on how much current can flow because

366
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:53,319
they have a resistance so these ceramic

367
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,869
capacitors the little capacitors have a

368
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,429
much lower ESR which means that they're

369
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:58,980
very good for high-frequency stuff so

370
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,569
say for example you want some sort of

371
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,240
energy reservoir so that's some power

372
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:05,679
your parents and device and you want to

373
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,649
make sure that it's got very smooth

374
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:12,929
power the problem with big capacitors is

375
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:15,519
they can't provide power very quickly

376
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,040
they come they can't change the amount

377
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,240
of current that the output very quickly

378
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,299
so ceramic capacitors are really good to

379
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,790
that because they've got a very low

380
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,439
internal internal resistance whereas

381
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,540
electrolytic capacitors they can store a

382
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:32,319
lot more energy but they've got a higher

383
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,889
ESR so there are a couple of other types

384
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,779
at the bottom tantalum 's I mean on film

385
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,600
they basically sit somewhere else the

386
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,589
spectrum between them some of them have

387
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,999
additional properties like being able to

388
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,480
withstand very high voltages and things

389
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,660
like that

390
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,470
but that's not too important well it is

391
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,540
if you're building your so here that

392
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,850
requires less hood there's another type

393
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,910
capacitive cord inductors effectively

394
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,139
like a little wire coil not going to

395
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,040
come in to them that much because but

396
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,079
I'm not going to go into them at all

397
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,809
because you mostly don't need to know

398
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:03,069
about them

399
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,799
other than if you see one it's probably

400
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,188
relate to power or radios does it but

401
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,189
mostly power

402
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,260
practice so you've got these active

403
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,250
components as well as passive components

404
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,709
are two component things like

405
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,569
transistors things like operational

406
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:23,740
amplifiers off hands and things like

407
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,639
logic gates so these are devices that

408
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,470
sort of

409
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,900
can switch things on and off they

410
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,610
usually have a power supply pins on them

411
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,780
that take some sort of power supply yeah

412
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,810
so for example you probably heard that

413
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,399
if you've ever looked into you know any

414
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,139
electronic stuff you probably seen an

415
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,830
example of a transistor switching an LED

416
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,500
on and off so that's that's those kinds

417
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,460
of sort of classes devices won't go into

418
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,350
them too much we're talk about logic

419
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:58,090
gates laser diodes so diodes are a weird

420
00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:00,659
one there's an argument in the strict

421
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,370
definition they are active components

422
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,130
but most electronics engineers just

423
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,649
treat them as passives so diodes allow

424
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,210
the flow of current in one direction if

425
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,810
you try and pass current in the wrong

426
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:17,500
direction they don't pass current with

427
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,980
some slight exceptions so they're quite

428
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,820
useful things like protecting against

429
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:27,100
reverse polarity

430
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,419
by attaching a power source so you if

431
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,939
you've ever seen a device way you know

432
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,800
you can connect an AA battery and if you

433
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
vent the battery backwards it just

434
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,440
doesn't do anything

435
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,870
chances are there's a diode in there

436
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,460
protecting it from protecting the

437
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,479
circuit from inverse polarity because if

438
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,280
you don't have one you might blow a

439
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,450
bunch of stuff up I think these are also

440
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,590
dives light emitting diodes but yeah

441
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,240
it's one of these ones where they're

442
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,949
sort of hot they sit on that kind of

443
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,390
border of being active and passive a

444
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,310
little bit so circuit boards I'm

445
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,450
guessing a lot of Hugh if you look at a

446
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,460
circuit board you can see something like

447
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,300
this oh no oh my god what that hell does

448
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,600
any of that do it probably looks like a

449
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,129
giant mess there are some indications so

450
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,520
for example you can google something

451
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,400
part numbers I'm guessing by the fact

452
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,950
that that says Samsung and it's got some

453
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
number in there but that's probably RAM

454
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,250
or flash or something like that but it

455
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,020
can be quite difficult to sort of dig

456
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,180
around and work out what this all all

457
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,490
does so let's just take them all writ

458
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,560
more they kill this example anybody know

459
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,010
what this is take a good guess

460
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,129
oh it is a graphics card this is an

461
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,029
Nvidia

462
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,080
1080 with the hissings income taken off

463
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,539
it

464
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,039
anybody who's built a PC before can

465
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,940
probably guess what some of this stuff

466
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,559
does but so power on the right these

467
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,259
power connectors got these six pin

468
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:58,549
innate and power connectors do use use a

469
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,600
lot out too much to run through this

470
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,940
little piece y'all you pay for the

471
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,019
bottom so they have these big power

472
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,340
connectors these are what's called after

473
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,960
like an exorcism sub you can connect

474
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,330
multiple graphics cards together and

475
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,299
improve your performance from stop then

476
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,600
you've got obviously your outputs here C

477
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:21,408
but your hdmi and displayport or

478
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,320
whatever now a lot a lot of working out

479
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:26,419
what parts of a circuit board does what

480
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,100
is actually just sort of the geometry of

481
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,740
the thing the topology the way it's all

482
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,809
laid out so we know that this power

483
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,460
coming in here we can probably guess

484
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,460
that this is the GD yourself the

485
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,679
processor so we can see some power stuff

486
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,480
coming in here we can see a bunch of

487
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,289
electrolytic capacitors these big cam

488
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,120
asses are a bunch of stuff over here

489
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,950
that looks like a bunch of capacitors

490
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,649
and some other thing here these are

491
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,210
actually inductors but it looks like

492
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:55,250
some power related stuff over here and

493
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:01,279
some chips here that might be related to

494
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,990
power maybe then you've got the GPU we

495
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,330
know that the GPU has a bunch of VRAM on

496
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,789
it well these are RAM chips this is

497
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,970
around it and then you've got I want you

498
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:13,700
to stop here that's possibly related to

499
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,350
maybe output may be some other auxilary

500
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,769
functions you've got this imp up here so

501
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:21,158
there's maybe some stuff going on around

502
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:26,299
this connector is related that content

503
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:29,210
so if I wanted to know for example so

504
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:32,950
GPUs have fun what if I want to guess

505
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,779
where that fun way was stalled store

506
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,730
we've got power here this is a horse of

507
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:41,059
a collector power so probably all this

508
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,100
stuff over here is a power none of this

509
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:45,019
looks like it stores firmware what it

510
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,120
looks like is interests or grammar chip

511
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:50,080
which means that it's probably going to

512
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,199
be somewhere in this bit here now

513
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,990
somewhere

514
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,220
usually stored on little flash chips I

515
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,880
happen to know that this graphics card

516
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:02,630
has a dual BIOS functionality like one

517
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,340
stock pile someone overclocked files so

518
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,260
they're probably two chips for that and

519
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,939
I can see one little a kinship here and

520
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,299
one that late internship here which

521
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:15,169
means that that probably the blasters so

522
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,700
just based on taking a look at the board

523
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,169
and how its laid out and where things go

524
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,080
in where things go out my power comes

525
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:23,169
from where the connectors are you if the

526
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,809
board is well designed you can sort of

527
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:31,429
infer a lot from them that's not the

528
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:34,789
only thing that you can use so when

529
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,380
people are designing circuits let's say

530
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:38,870
you've got you know three engineers

531
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,789
working on a circuit or you know even 50

532
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,260
engineers working on a particular design

533
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:44,059
they need to be able to talk to each

534
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,470
other about you know particular sections

535
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,450
of the design or this thing around here

536
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,309
well rather than just saying that

537
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,289
transistor over there all that diode

538
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:55,850
over there what they do is they give

539
00:22:51,289 --> 00:23:00,200
each part a an identifier unique

540
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,059
identifier for the the design so this

541
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,710
usually start with a letter or a

542
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,360
sequence of letters describing what the

543
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,950
part is so there's a resistor it start

544
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,299
with r if it's a faster it starts with C

545
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,149
and then you've got the number after it

546
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,299
which indicates which one it is so C 1 C

547
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:15,789
2 C 3 is equal for some reason well

548
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,720
actually you might be wondering why

549
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,820
transistors of Q if you can actually

550
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,450
read that it's a bit of a weird one

551
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:27,110
well T was already taken transformer and

552
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm told the reason that it's a queue is

553
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,928
that old transistors used to be in like

554
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,190
a round case and I had a little melt app

555
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:36,470
coming off it and if you look at it from

556
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,309
the bottom around round circle with a

557
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,889
little tab comin off look like a kid

558
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,049
bitter silly knowledge so on that

559
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:48,110
particular board first go back a couple

560
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:53,179
of slides so this is zoomed in section

561
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:55,399
but this area here and you can see that

562
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,980
we've got some reference designators on

563
00:23:55,399 --> 00:24:01,250
here so you've got the c-141 seven so

564
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,930
all of this is capacitors glasses these

565
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,820
are l32 five

566
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,650
l believes inductor so we have these are

567
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,139
inductors inductors picking up -

568
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,310
especially about how stuff q that's

569
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,920
transistors so go back we can guess that

570
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,020
these are all capacitors here these will

571
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,000
doctors and these are all transistors

572
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,030
these are all power what's called power

573
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,940
faces for that particular design so we

574
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,530
know that that's all related to power

575
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,790
but of course you don't just you know

576
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,610
when you're designing a board you don't

577
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,070
just start on the PCB you want a circuit

578
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,020
diagram to serve describe the circuit

579
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,260
initially and then once you got that now

580
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,300
you can turn that into a PCB design so

581
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,060
I'm guessing sometimes you look at you

582
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,770
thought we might find a circuit back up

583
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:49,440
online I think what the hell is any of

584
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:52,190
this do this is from xkcd of course

585
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,410
there are always always a relevant xkcd

586
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm guessing sometimes you take a look

587
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,360
at it and you go oh my god what does any

588
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,830
of that do so here is another thing that

589
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,840
it's not particularly simple I mean this

590
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,689
is quite quite a simple circuit but it's

591
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,870
not completely trivial just to give you

592
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:14,340
an idea of what circuit diagrams look

593
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:15,360
like and how to interpret them so you

594
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,070
can see here that they use the

595
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,229
american-style resistor symbol so far

596
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,530
well you know it's a resistor d1 that's

597
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,850
diode secret and that's passed down you

598
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,920
can see that with this plus sign here

599
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,719
but it's an electrolytic type because

600
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:37,310
it's public here note the sign lines

601
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,820
nonpolar is likely a ceramic capacitor

602
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:44,850
usually on designs you'll see dots where

603
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,330
these lines joins and say that these are

604
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,120
connected

605
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,699
say for example here no dot not

606
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,300
connected just to be confusing no dot

607
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,870
still connected people with people about

608
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,970
it making circuit diagrams so this is

609
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,729
actually a voltage doubler circuit in

610
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,360
one corner so this is just saying go to

611
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,800
power let's just say go to ground this

612
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,540
is a slightly older circuit diagram

613
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,330
different circuit thank you

614
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:17,790
pop of light timer again difference in

615
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,699
the electrolytic capacitor but it's some

616
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:25,250
other spot positive similar showing that

617
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,240
it's electricity type itv1 push money

618
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,520
put this little drawing up a push button

619
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,900
here and these resistors you can see

620
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,060
that this is got a reference that

621
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,460
there's a negative r3 and the value of

622
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,580
470 ohms which is sometimes written is

623
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,140
not this is a really old style design

624
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,090
you can tell because they use this

625
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,440
symbol for ground which is a really old

626
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:50,459
symbol for ground you see that you know

627
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,420
it's it's really messy yeah like old TVs

628
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,290
in business

629
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,690
yeah and then without actually even

630
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,700
having any symbol showing where the

631
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,870
house coming from you just got this

632
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,850
thing that has just said what this

633
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,649
entire rail at the top runs out so what

634
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,409
you can X to quite 5 to 15 volts

635
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:11,310
positive and one thing I will point out

636
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:13,620
from the previous point is sometimes

637
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,450
it's another value you'll see a part

638
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,739
number so you've got diet one which is a

639
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,140
1n4007

640
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,910
though so that's that's the kind of

641
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:27,950
thing you like to see on all circuit

642
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:31,290
diagrams talk about that logic so logic

643
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:35,790
if you saw fits as Todd mentioned some

644
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:39,899
stuff around that briefly so logic here

645
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:41,670
or binary has ones and zeros in circuits

646
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:47,300
is represented with high and low

647
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:50,340
voltages so a voltage of zero volts or

648
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:53,490
local teachers is zero and about is the

649
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:58,320
positive voltage usually that means one

650
00:27:53,490 --> 00:28:03,860
usually so generally yeah zeros zero

651
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:06,330
volts ones positive bulbs logic levels

652
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,699
so when we talk about positive voltage

653
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,770
how much positive voltage this is 100

654
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,410
volts 5 volts one of them usually you'll

655
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:17,780
see these 5 volts 3.3 volts with my

656
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:21,780
eyeballs yeah it depends on the device

657
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:25,050
an important thing to note is if you try

658
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,270
to connect a 5-volt logic device and the

659
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,840
3.3 volt logic device together and bad

660
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,580
things and have

661
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,949
pride so this isn't as an oscilloscope

662
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,629
trace trace by device without putting a

663
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:44,010
zero than a 1 and a 0 a 1 and a 0 and

664
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:48,090
you see that it's about about 5 volts so

665
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:54,440
you've got a 0 not about 5 volts 0 vol 5

666
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:58,649
months that's 0 1 0 1 yeah

667
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,990
same thing again but we 3.3 volts so

668
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:04,530
again the one is about 3.3 volts in the

669
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:07,140
zero is about general's so don't blow up

670
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,060
your hardware you might be familiar with

671
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,520
a few of these devices they have

672
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:16,560
different voltage logic logic levels so

673
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,980
some number than 5 volts some 3.3 volts

674
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,050
some of them like the teensy they run at

675
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,550
3.3 volts but the inputs will take 5

676
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,760
volts they're tolerant what's called

677
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,820
tolerant but if you put 5 all things to

678
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,740
say about 3pi

679
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:37,679
gqo and input pin you can blow not only

680
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:41,280
that I'm guessing you're all roughly

681
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,670
familiar with sort of the digital logic

682
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,500
stuff in terms of you've heard what an

683
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,550
XOR and an end is you know the same sort

684
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,160
of thing in programming all of this

685
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,270
comes from hard way so all of these pit

686
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,390
wise operations just come straight

687
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,600
hardware so you've got to the two inputs

688
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,360
a and B in these particular devices or

689
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,750
one important in case of Knapke

690
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,300
and they perform some sort function and

691
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,020
then they output something we use news q

692
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:12,810
as the output

693
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:14,520
I cannot remember why reasons possibly

694
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,870
related to the fact that he was used as

695
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,030
a transistor and these are made out of

696
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:21,929
transistors Vaughn I don't touch any

697
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:24,470
other yeah no idea so say for example

698
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,420
you put a low voltage to zero volts here

699
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,970
and a high voltage say 5 volts here you

700
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,970
go zero here because it's Manship it was

701
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,330
huddled here I don't share high voltage

702
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:39,590
here I mean you can stick a lot of these

703
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,899
gates together and other types of

704
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:45,300
devices to make various types of logic

705
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:49,110
circuits and build processors and blah

706
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:51,710
blah now one thing to mention is our

707
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,959
clocks so I'm guessing you've all heard

708
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:58,200
but you all know about processor clock

709
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,070
frequencies things like that so you know

710
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,400
you get an Intel Core i7 @ 3.5 gigahertz

711
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:09,480
or whatever well what that really means

712
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:11,670
is devices that have digital devices

713
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,310
that have a kind of state so whether

714
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,770
that be memory or whether you know

715
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,419
there'd be some sort of control device

716
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,420
in there there's doing some sort of

717
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:25,320
digital processing it could be a

718
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,600
microcontroller or microprocessor what

719
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,360
happens is that these devices are only

720
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,560
perform operations when the clock ticks

721
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,149
so usually what we say is it's on the

722
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,560
rising edge

723
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,020
I apologize for their lack of contrast

724
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,159
in this image on but I will just sort of

725
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:47,820
draw a red line so you can't see it very

726
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,230
well so what's happening here is a clock

727
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,360
signal it's just something that goes to

728
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,330
zero one zero one zero one zero one very

729
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,080
very very very quickly or very slowly

730
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:00,199
but usually pretty and what happens is

731
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,120
these devices perform an operation on

732
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,980
the rising usually on the rising but

733
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,169
sometimes on the falling but usually on

734
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,020
the rising edge in this clock so as the

735
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:13,410
transition varies from 0 to 1 we call

736
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,379
them tick and then there are two why the

737
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,810
tick so devices do do it on the falling

738
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,740
edge from a time bomb really here so

739
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,100
you're on the falling edge it would be

740
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,290
from 1 to 0 but most things on the

741
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,080
bottom edge and the time difference

742
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:32,250
between each tip is called the clock

743
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:36,560
period and if you take one over the

744
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,560
clock period so say that pop period is a

745
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:42,330
microseconds let's just say so the time

746
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,790
between here and here is one millisecond

747
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,919
u1 divide that you get thousands that's

748
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,810
1,000 that's all

749
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,270
kilohertz so that's that's what you get

750
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:56,139
pregnancies and things like that from so

751
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,139
we're gonna talk about processes

752
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,730
processes are sort of split into three

753
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,630
main types

754
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,600
you've got microprocessors

755
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,460
microcontrollers and programmable logic

756
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,850
now program will not be necessarily a

757
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,020
processor but I've put it onto this

758
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,889
category because it's easier to talk

759
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,720
about here so micro processors are they

760
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:21,010
fetch instructions they decode those

761
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,450
instructions and then they execute them

762
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,940
so if you've ever done anything to do

763
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:29,330
with processor design or processor

764
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,590
internals do anything say in course

765
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,929
module you might have heard about the

766
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,699
fetch execute cycle which is fetching

767
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,230
instruction execute instruction fetch

768
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,690
the next instruction basically nodes

769
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,040
instruction

770
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,620
microprocessors use external memory so

771
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,200
they have no RAM on board not in the

772
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:50,120
chip so they've been we have to put that

773
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,440
separately they have no flash on board

774
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,590
so they don't to store any code on board

775
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,480
this is less true of things like desktop

776
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,590
processors because that they've really

777
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,840
muddied the waters with that sort of

778
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,750
stuff but we're talking you know all

779
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,459
original processors mark processes

780
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,260
everything was kept external

781
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,168
they use external peripherals as well so

782
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,330
for example if you wanted to store some

783
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:13,159
configuration variables across the

784
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,230
reboots you can't be that insider

785
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,850
processor because there's no unless of

786
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,340
like a permanent fashion so that and

787
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,199
examply the side locks at eighty looking

788
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,820
at this room I'm guessing many of you

789
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,889
will have never heard of this thing

790
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,320
it's very processor the powers the ZX

791
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,199
Spectrum I chose this one specifically

792
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,790
because if I've said that Intel Core i7

793
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,020
most of the things I wrote on here about

794
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,400
them using external memory and

795
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,199
peripherals would be wrong because they

796
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,510
just really really do that on a modern

797
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,629
system it is very very bloated and

798
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,340
there's lots of things in there but yes

799
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:47,110
that eighty all it really does is these

800
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,970
first three things fetch decode execute

801
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,040
microcontrollers however they contain a

802
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,449
microprocessor but they also contain

803
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,630
memories they have their own brand

804
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,759
building on the jetty and they have

805
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,820
program flash built in

806
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,360
so the idea of these is you can program

807
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,010
a single chip with some wisdom code and

808
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,320
that chip on its own numbers like a

809
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,410
standalone device will execute that code

810
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,000
it has its own RAM inside it and you

811
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,399
don't need the supporting components

812
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,940
externally it also usually has things

813
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,570
like interval peripherals so for example

814
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:25,450
for a some of them have like a Wi-Fi

815
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,510
interface built into them things like

816
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,290
that there's sort of a general purpose

817
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:34,300
device so an example is the atmel atmega

818
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,860
328p which again you probably never

819
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,050
heard of but I guess you have heard an

820
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:41,350
Arduino that's the chip that's inside

821
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,870
nod it you know you know so that's what

822
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:46,210
comes that now program logic is a bit of

823
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:48,819
a weird one so if you remember the logic

824
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,790
gates I showed earlier think of it it's

825
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,160
like a giant configurable array of logic

826
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,690
gates you can sort of say okay I want

827
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,000
this logic gate and then I want to

828
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,040
connect it to this logic a and etc etc

829
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,060
and then that's a block and then I want

830
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:08,190
this block this block it's kind of like

831
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:10,990
logic Lego inside of inside of the chair

832
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,730
so yes an interconnected logic it

833
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,149
doesn't execute instructions not on its

834
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,580
own volition

835
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,490
it's an executed instructions it has

836
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,970
sort of measured logic stuff good

837
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,310
together

838
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,779
they use it for more specialist

839
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,330
specialist applications in some cases

840
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,850
they use for just like okay we want this

841
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,069
whole bunch of like our interconnecting

842
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,190
logic to talk to it to handle some

843
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,770
specific some specific thing but we

844
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,120
don't want to have say 70 chips to

845
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,500
implement this one thing so they were

846
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:44,109
just getting a towel or a PLA which is a

847
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,540
programmable logic array just a good

848
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,650
don't do that kind of thing you can make

849
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,300
them implement what processors and

850
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,970
microcontrollers because at the end of

851
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,250
the day processors are just a big array

852
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:01,490
of gates memory is just

853
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:04,990
what's got a flip-flop the Popeye sees

854
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:07,009
each flip-flop can solve one bit of data

855
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,270
and it used to cut big array of them

856
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,520
together well now you've got eight bits

857
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,960
of data that's a bite if you stick a

858
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,170
whole load of em together you can make

859
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,570
kilowatts on etc etc so you can

860
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,420
implement mic processors or

861
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,210
microcontrollers on these types of

862
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:27,830
devices particularly at PGA's an example

863
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:29,660
of FPGA is the lattice I sporty FPGA the

864
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:33,200
reason I mentioned this one is because

865
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:36,440
it's fairly obvious accessible the chips

866
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,480
are very cheap you can buy a little USB

867
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,050
dev board called the tiny FPGA it's

868
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,890
pretty pretty fantastic thing and it's

869
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:50,660
AI think it's like 60 $60 or something

870
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:52,400
is it is it even less well what $55 yeah

871
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,598
so if you won't play around with FPGA

872
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,760
team you do that there and an example

873
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,680
application is I don't know how many of

874
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,140
you have heard of risk 5 but risk 5 is

875
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,779
code like an open-source processing

876
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,060
architecture so you know you've got like

877
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,530
x86 you've got arm well risk 5 is a

878
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,359
different architecture and it's designed

879
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,930
to be open so it's an open specification

880
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:13,670
and there are a bunch of implementations

881
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,680
risk 5 implementations for FPGAs so if

882
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,920
you wanted to build a device that's open

883
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,250
source all the way down to the sort of

884
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,520
processor logic level you can use that

885
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:30,140
to build let use EJ's to be that kind of

886
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,359
thing interfaces well these devices on

887
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,799
their own not very useful unless they

888
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:38,029
can talk to talk to other things so just

889
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,420
like with a laptop you might have an

890
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,830
Ethernet cable you might have USB

891
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,619
microprocessors and microcontrollers

892
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,509
need interfaces to talk to other

893
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,390
peripheral devices say for example flash

894
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:55,820
chips temperature sensors external

895
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:57,020
memory i/o are gyroscopes that kind of

896
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,820
thing

897
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:04,430
even just LEDs so the most simple is

898
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:08,950
GPIO if you're in fences for earlier you

899
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:11,560
mentioned you guys judo so GPIO is

900
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,299
simple output but I face it we just pins

901
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,680
that come off of the processor and that

902
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,810
you can reconfigure them to do different

903
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,669
things so the most simple thing you can

904
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,920
reconfigure them to do is be an output

905
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:24,579
or an input so an output so this is a

906
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,650
what we know code yeah an output you can

907
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,470
configure entity an output you can write

908
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,440
a hi to it which sets the voltage high

909
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,779
and you can set right loads they accept

910
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,609
quality but in fact this example makes

911
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,260
an LED on on and off with one second gap

912
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:42,700
in this obviously can do to set of

913
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:47,560
inputs and just read whether it's not

914
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:51,540
although voltage so you aren't so you

915
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,589
artists often miss described as cereal

916
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,950
cereal just generally means that

917
00:39:53,589 --> 00:40:00,750
something that happens in one big line

918
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:03,730
that's not parallel but a lot of cereal

919
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:07,960
effectively all it is is a way of

920
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:10,329
sending bits down wire in a sequence so

921
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,329
you get this solve it and then it will

922
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:18,010
turn this bits 1 2 3 4 5 7 8

923
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:21,369
so 0 7 so that's what bytes and you have

924
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,800
to stop it so you can send in two bites

925
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,670
down why it's what this code does is it

926
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,319
says okay I want to send 9600 bites down

927
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:33,790
the wire every second it's coordinated

928
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,890
system board that the older ones of you

929
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,970
will know what board is more than the

930
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,950
younger ones because we've been playing

931
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:44,200
with the optical modems so all this

932
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:47,770
isn't really doing is saying okay send

933
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,490
the ASCII value H down the wire and E

934
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:53,950
and Allah etc etc season hello well some

935
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:57,819
users send text read bytes and they can

936
00:40:53,950 --> 00:41:02,049
also receive as well Suzy UART are used

937
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:04,349
for like debug outputs on brutal boards

938
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,890
and things like that all the time

939
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:11,560
now rs-232 is also disguised as serial

940
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:14,049
they are not the same thing rs-232 is

941
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,400
quite an older protocol if anybody

942
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,079
remembers serial

943
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,960
on the back of all pcs the lot the old

944
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:25,839
ninepenny serial connectors and DV nines

945
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,760
so the way that works is you've got a

946
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,759
voltage all the way with as high as 15

947
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,890
volts only that was negative 15 volts

948
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,140
and what happens is in order to

949
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:38,799
represent ones and zeros anything

950
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,980
between plus 3 plus 15 it it's actually

951
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:45,089
a zero and anything between minus 3 and

952
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,380
minus 50 is ideal one just to be weird

953
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:49,480
so here you've got the say it's the same

954
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,220
sort of scheme as you are so you can see

955
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,260
here you've got this stop it and stop it

956
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,700
bits transferred in between this is

957
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,039
literally the same same thing you will

958
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,490
this stop it you've got one one zero

959
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,990
cause you got these represented one

960
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,868
represents a zero all the way through

961
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,859
and any but you stop it it's important

962
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,569
to know the difference between these two

963
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:10,420
things because if you try to plug an

964
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:12,069
rs-232 outputs into a you up receiver

965
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,680
you will probably blow up your you up

966
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,970
receiver because plus and minus 15 volts

967
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,200
is not minutes going through your

968
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:23,109
receiver you aren't operates at the the

969
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,149
logic level of board so as we're

970
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:28,509
discussing before 5 volts take my 3

971
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,520
volts 1.8 volts sometimes lower but you

972
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:34,089
usually going to see 5 point 5 5 5 volts

973
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:37,089
input my free so yeah don't put that in

974
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:38,828
into the wrong thing but you get rs-232

975
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:43,380
receivers I guess the obvious duty to

976
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:46,839
zip instead cheaply online again by like

977
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,700
15 the money life and nothing which is

978
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,788
good because about 10 percent you broke

979
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:54,490
them on their one that's purely so as me

980
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,799
eyes a little bit more more complicated

981
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:59,339
than the previous two actually I stands

982
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:02,589
for serial peripheral interface again

983
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:03,849
flash tips if you remember the BIOS

984
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:07,029
chips that I was mentioning and

985
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:11,579
mentioning on that and video card they

986
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:13,710
get to spoken to by spines going

987
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:16,210
generally you have this concept of a

988
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,069
SQLite master and spi slave

989
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,410
slightly problematic terminology but

990
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:23,279
this autumn's from like the 1970s or

991
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,808
something so it uses slightly different

992
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:26,970
these days you might also see primary in

993
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:29,280
a second

994
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:32,700
the idea is if you make remember I

995
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,250
mentioned the clock before so master

996
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:40,859
device provides this clock to say when

997
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:43,820
data should be read off the or sense so

998
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,780
this is mozzie master out slave in

999
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:50,010
mustard out slave and the Sun is coming

1000
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:53,190
out of the master in slave and then a

1001
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,480
master in laid out say about the idea is

1002
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:59,970
this is a spent essentially like

1003
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:02,340
transmit and receive then modern you

1004
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,640
want this thing on SS this can also be

1005
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:08,490
called DX or CS so excess means slave

1006
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,589
select DX means device select CS means

1007
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,529
chip select they all mean the same thing

1008
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:18,240
and what that basically means is when

1009
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:22,200
the SPI master SS said to the asserts

1010
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,750
the SS signal the slave says those slave

1011
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,480
starts listening and the idea is that to

1012
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,420
save pins because adding more pins to

1013
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,460
devices is expensive to save pins you

1014
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,270
can have say let's say you've got five

1015
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:41,370
slave devices and what master device you

1016
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:43,740
can have the clock and i/o lines shared

1017
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:46,500
across all of those and then one select

1018
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,399
line per device so the idea is that then

1019
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
if you want to talk to one specific

1020
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,590
device you just say you just assert that

1021
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,590
one pen for that for that chips select

1022
00:44:52,590 --> 00:45:00,000
and then send stuff over the sense of

1023
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:01,830
the rest of the wires again use the this

1024
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,240
gets used all over the place but small

1025
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:09,480
devices like temperature sensors and

1026
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,290
temperature sensors and flakka memory

1027
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,740
and things like that

1028
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:17,009
I squared C is another thing that's very

1029
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:20,959
similar to SPI is you pretty much

1030
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:26,250
exactly the same types of application

1031
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:29,250
again it's a against red and shaped bus

1032
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,770
sort of design except in this particular

1033
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,670
case I suppose you only have one data

1034
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:37,280
line it's quite directional so the

1035
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,580
devices transmit and receive

1036
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,800
the same lot of snap online and the SCL

1037
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,740
bottom is the clock n which is provided

1038
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,450
by the my son casino IDs don't worry too

1039
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,890
much about this all this means is that

1040
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,049
there's a couple of pull-up resistors on

1041
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:54,620
here the idea is that when these devices

1042
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:56,690
stop talking it causes the voltage on

1043
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,700
these lines to sort of float weakly up

1044
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,340
towards the vault the vulture Pro and

1045
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,109
that's just to do with how the protocol

1046
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:07,990
works in terms of the little hardware

1047
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:10,160
but the way that these devices can tell

1048
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,979
which one master wants to talk to at

1049
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,069
once is they each have an address

1050
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,310
the address is usually I think is so

1051
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,670
busy

1052
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:21,049
it's an 8-bit value since seven so of

1053
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,590
course it's a seventh bit value just to

1054
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,870
be confusing seven bit value usually you

1055
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:30,200
get the option so in the part state

1056
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,759
machine you'll see how you can figure

1057
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,319
that usually there's like a couple of

1058
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,870
pins that you pull high or low to

1059
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,260
configure what app addresses you usually

1060
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:41,359
have fairly restrictive configurability

1061
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,490
like you can't configure the full seven

1062
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,440
bit address you'll be able to configure

1063
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,819
two three bits of that address so the

1064
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,460
idea being if you've got three and the

1065
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,500
same device you have the same device you

1066
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:56,000
can just configure those to be slightly

1067
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,600
different from each other I haven't got

1068
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,920
time to go into SM possible SF buses I

1069
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,259
can't have more modern version of this

1070
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:07,330
that runs on top of I squared C and it's

1071
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:09,580
used in PC motherboard a lot through tag

1072
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:12,170
so again if you were in fittest or Kelly

1073
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:17,090
attack will have been mentioned so JTAG

1074
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:19,130
joint test action group which is a weird

1075
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:22,190
thing to call in his face really it

1076
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:25,790
stops now there's kind of a way to test

1077
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:28,070
the boards have been properly the world

1078
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,540
working properly that from a particular

1079
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,370
connector you can see that all of the

1080
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,310
parts that were on there are all talking

1081
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:36,770
but we're all available and working and

1082
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,480
even Talton then they started adding in

1083
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,160
debug functionality so judo tanks are

1084
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,540
really cool because you can if you get

1085
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,250
it configured right which is a massive

1086
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,810
hand and you ask most of the time you

1087
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,340
can stop debugging check so you can

1088
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:48,310
cause the tip to reset you can stop

1089
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,450
going through them like GEB and

1090
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,220
and through the code that's running on

1091
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,700
that processor and even dump memory and

1092
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:58,209
things like that and then isp and ice

1093
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:01,180
ice SP ISP is in system programmer and

1094
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,650
ICS P is in circuit serial programmer

1095
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,299
they're effectively the same I think

1096
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,860
there's a I'd like slight differences in

1097
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,900
the actual protocol and how they work

1098
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,480
but they're effectively they do the same

1099
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,730
thing so what used to happen way way way

1100
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,170
before this existed was if you had a

1101
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,390
device that had to have some fun web

1102
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,470
program on programmed onto it and the

1103
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,299
board will go for the production line

1104
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,700
you have to pre flash those chips

1105
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,890
separately before they got sold it onto

1106
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,810
the board that's a real pain in terms of

1107
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,680
like mass manufacturing so what they did

1108
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,380
is they came up with this thing called

1109
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,750
ISPs or ICS P and the idea is you've got

1110
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,000
like a header that's on there that you

1111
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,730
can then while that chip is in the

1112
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,290
circuit use it to program that chip

1113
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:44,190
program phone where once there it also

1114
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,140
means that you can use it to reflash

1115
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,310
existing boards once you've got them so

1116
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,589
there are cases where you can flash like

1117
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:54,850
third-party servers something with is

1118
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:58,960
PHP so some tools I recommend you get a

1119
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:01,120
multimeter don't get like the absolute

1120
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,710
cheapest Chinese knockoff one because

1121
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,870
chances are I can't say it is safe for

1122
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,030
you know 230 volts or something and just

1123
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:08,380
take it and then it will explode just

1124
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,700
getting any old friend of one get a

1125
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,000
cheap one doesn't really matter you

1126
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,319
don't need massive precision out of it

1127
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,410
it's just you talk about telling you

1128
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,900
know where where power rail is for

1129
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:21,220
example so just this pin out five volts

1130
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,460
going to it yes this opponent does have

1131
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,330
five volts going to it so much meter bit

1132
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,920
simple

1133
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,170
the dead easy to use you can Google if

1134
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,910
you confused about how to use one but

1135
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,860
you can find out online usually much in

1136
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,379
current as well things like that

1137
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:37,000
oscilloscopes oscilloscopes are really

1138
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,200
useful because you can use them to debug

1139
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,020
circuits but you can also use them to

1140
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:48,730
reverse engineer things the ds2 one two

1141
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:51,040
is kind of cheap I think it's things

1142
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:53,830
like sixty pounds or something

1143
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,590
fifty sixty pounds looks like a smart

1144
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:00,500
phone and it's got a couple of channels

1145
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:02,030
and you can hook that up to things and

1146
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,650
see the signals that are flying up

1147
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:08,780
across a particular pen in real time

1148
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,100
deadly use for dead team I recommend

1149
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,860
getting one if you're just looking for

1150
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,640
looking for a looking cheap option

1151
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:17,120
you've got this other thing called this

1152
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,129
openwork mental logic sniffer well this

1153
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,710
is it support is a bit like a bus pirate

1154
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,140
but with lots and lots of pins on the

1155
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,400
end and it can only receive and the

1156
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,560
other is think the each of those pins

1157
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,520
can only receive a logical one or a

1158
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:34,910
logical zero they can't report any more

1159
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,310
granularity than that so it's a it's a

1160
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,810
logic analyzer but there's some software

1161
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,320
that comes along with that that allows

1162
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:44,540
you to define what each pin means for a

1163
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,980
particular protocol and then decode the

1164
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,650
results of that so if you've got a say

1165
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,850
for example SPI bus and you want to go

1166
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,480
to sniff the data that's coming up back

1167
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,670
you go

1168
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,020
okay well that was and it'll tell you

1169
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,400
all the data that was going across and

1170
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,710
show you where the transactions sort and

1171
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,080
stop Pecos there's a more expensive

1172
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,180
option is a USB oscilloscope this is

1173
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,490
more of a professional tool I have one

1174
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,839
of these it's really great the software

1175
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:10,220
that comes with it I think runs on

1176
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:14,030
Windows Linux and Mac it's pretty decent

1177
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,740
they are quite expensive I think the the

1178
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:20,950
cheaper models start at around 600

1179
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:22,939
pounds I recommend is going on eBay and

1180
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:25,189
looking to see if you can find

1181
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,190
secondhand ones and B stock models

1182
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,260
because when new board revisions come

1183
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:33,530
out picot tech dump all of they're

1184
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:38,650
always stock models on eBay for like I

1185
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,650
think it's like 50% of the retail price

1186
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:44,570
yeah great that's ket alternatively if

1187
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,190
you want a proper oscilloscope and you

1188
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,960
don't want to pay too much but you don't

1189
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,650
care if it's massive bulky heavy and

1190
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,110
power-hungry

1191
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,870
get yourself an old CRT scope I have one

1192
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:55,730
of these it's older than me and it still

1193
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,210
works it's pretty fantastic

1194
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:02,270
so yeah that's good another good option

1195
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:03,340
terms of interfaces are FTE t32 h boards

1196
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,790
are absolutely

1197
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:14,410
you can get them very very cheaply again

1198
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:17,350
about 77 quid - Fitz's 7-7 hacks four

1199
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:21,160
seven seven pounds with it up the name

1200
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,390
sorry yeah you can do quite a lot of

1201
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,490
things with just this board it speaks

1202
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:27,940
spy it speaks I swear to you speak to

1203
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:29,379
you up it's very useful there's the bus

1204
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,880
pirate I don't like it that much

1205
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,770
I like the Hydra bus the Hydra bus is

1206
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,130
like the most pirate the faster better

1207
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:39,220
and has a bunch of extra support Glasgow

1208
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,480
Glasgow is not finished really it's it's

1209
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:45,250
an ongoing project it's being built by

1210
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,630
two people onto the white clock and mark

1211
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,870
and 42

1212
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,700
it's an FPGA based tool the idea is that

1213
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,990
instead of having one chip that tries to

1214
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,720
deal with lots of things you have a

1215
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:57,160
reprogrammable chip that you say okay I

1216
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,720
would like the specialist application

1217
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,819
and then you flash that particular

1218
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,560
application on it for doing one specific

1219
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,500
thing so say for example you want to

1220
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,640
talk HDMI for example like other tools

1221
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,660
that that would be very difficult to do

1222
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:13,450
with Glasgow you just flash the HDMI

1223
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:15,399
core that and then run it the idea I

1224
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,799
think is that it going to cost about 70

1225
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,410
pounds 70 80 pounds when they come out

1226
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,960
there is only about ten revision see

1227
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,790
boards in existence but if you ask

1228
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,060
nicely there are some people on tour so

1229
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:29,880
it won't make you one so keep an eye out

1230
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,250
for that because it's a pretty cool tool

1231
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,200
for development stuff for building your

1232
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,460
own things I recommend odd we know it's

1233
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,299
a fantastic platform to get stuff done

1234
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,390
it's really easy

1235
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,500
the documentation is written with people

1236
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,009
who have never done the electronic stuff

1237
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,450
in mind kids use it you can work your

1238
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,470
head around it very easily it's quite

1239
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:50,080
nice

1240
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,240
no times you know the MCU boards are

1241
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,500
like Arduino boards except they run

1242
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,540
Wi-Fi they were on what's called an

1243
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:01,090
esp8266 and use them for doing like

1244
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,650
Wi-Fi IOT stuff I have an absolute ton

1245
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,560
of them the LED sticks that I mentioned

1246
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,820
there were enough known MCU boards so

1247
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,590
that you can control remember the Wi-Fi

1248
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,040
you don't see is practically pies and

1249
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,090
FCC's single what computers I don't

1250
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,730
really like them that much for doing

1251
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:19,340
hardware stuff but something would

1252
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:21,860
paradox prop just gets a mention here

1253
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,780
and it's a little bit like an Arduino

1254
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,280
it's not quite so well supported but

1255
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,830
it's pretty cool because it's got like

1256
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,790
multiple cores so the idea is that you

1257
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:35,090
get like eight or 16 cores in one chip

1258
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,259
they're a little bit more expensive but

1259
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:38,630
if you want to do stuff that's got like

1260
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,900
multi-core support so you want to do

1261
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:45,710
something that's very very parallel

1262
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:47,240
heavy you can plan that for radio stuff

1263
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,580
I'm just gonna make it go this you can

1264
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,939
get an auntie LFTR for about 10 pounds

1265
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,940
it's a TV tuner device that you can

1266
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,870
repurpose as a software-defined radio

1267
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,270
then you've got the sort of mid-price

1268
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:01,490
commercial commercial options reached

1269
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:04,790
hack RF and played RF and then if you

1270
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:06,740
want to go too pricey USRP the price

1271
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:11,150
here wants to transmit as well as

1272
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:14,140
receive so in conclusion I think more

1273
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,280
people should play with hardware I think

1274
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,170
it's one of these things where you don't

1275
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,640
need to necessarily have a huge amount

1276
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,430
of like domain background knowledge and

1277
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,980
electronics to start paying kids like

1278
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:29,419
Audrey no make it super easy and you can

1279
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,480
take the things that you learn from

1280
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:36,350
building things and use it to apply into

1281
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,810
your work for breaking things so yeah I

1282
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:40,960
remember them and that is the end of the

1283
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,960
talk

1284
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:50,359
and as promised here is my tied list of

1285
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:55,100
things that you should go take a look at

1286
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,100
feel free to write only so you do
