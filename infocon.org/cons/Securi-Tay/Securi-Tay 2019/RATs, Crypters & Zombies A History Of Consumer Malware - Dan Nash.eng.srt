1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,970
thank you so much everyone for coming

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000
along

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,700
I should get this this talks about the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,639
the rat industry or the remote access

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,470
trojan industry and the kind of Manoa in

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,180
the markets which has been developed to

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,859
support it but before we actually talk

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,810
about something interesting just to get

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,609
rid of the way so many know me some of

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,619
you probably uh hopefully don't I'm done

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,380
I work as a security engineer while

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,490
studying at Edinburgh Napier the

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,500
software engineering and as of up until

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,770
November I was part of the any second

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,080
Eddy so not this one

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,670
but either just full disclosure I don't

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,550
do malware as a job my job is in threat

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,250
intelligence so take that with you well

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,290
it is a hobby for me for now my max

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,930
resolves in infrastructure so very much

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,510
detached from all this but um as we call

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,700
and as we can try go back to site on

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,110
this topic which is very very vast and I

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,120
can't get into everything as much as I'd

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,190
like well we're gonna start with a quick

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,018
introduction on the essentially ancient

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,729
history what I find to be the first

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,490
things which could be considered rats or

29
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,340
you know remote admin tools as the as

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,919
the developers told them and we'll talk

31
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,560
a quick introduction on what malware is

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,979
on more specifically what a Trojan is

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,499
and this will all be important later

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,640
trust me and then hopefully well if the

35
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,158
talk makes it that long we'll move into

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,229
what I consider modern-day rotting

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,049
samples and again the the markets which

38
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,719
is sprung up to support them which is

39
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,819
quite important there will be time for

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,158
questions at the end hopefully so if

41
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,600
again the topic is quite vast well my

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,439
answers I don't know please don't be mad

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,559
at me so first of all do we all know

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,538
what malware is I guess we do but if

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,450
you're not sure malware is a portmanteau

46
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,920
of malicious software software which has

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,079
been specifically designed to disrupt

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,649
damage or gain unauthorized access but

49
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,630
something I noticed in researching this

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,329
is that people seem to take specifically

51
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,908
designed like to quite an extreme and

52
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,079
only think like a healer like if I make

53
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,280
a bit of malware but then instead of

54
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,530
software agreement in there that says

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,260
please don't use this as malware it

56
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,400
protects you we'll find out just how

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,069
true that is by the game

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,540
malware includes lots of different types

59
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,319
of programs like viruses which are

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,739
self-replicating

61
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,409
and worms which can spread by themselves

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,450
intrusions which we'll be talking about

63
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,798
but essentially the very simple versions

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,470
are religious programs which rely on

65
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,409
deception to be spread so like whether

66
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,150
it's a three fortnight VBox tool or

67
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,390
whether it's pictures from the runescape

68
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,129
girlfriend exe or whether it's whatever

69
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,540
someone's sending you the premise is

70
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,109
that you don't know that thinking it's

71
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,900
something else

72
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,000
so I thought in mind that what the hell

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,910
is the difference between a trojan and a

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,739
rat right so there's two so rather than

75
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,849
acronym and depending on who you ask

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,859
it either stands for remote access

77
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,450
trojan and this is what you know AV

78
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,549
companies column and/or it stands for

79
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,839
remote administration tools which is

80
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,280
what you know the producers of these

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,870
tools call them because obviously you

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,190
don't really put yourself in anyone's

83
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,599
good books by saying that you produce a

84
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,680
Georgian you know so whenever I first

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,970
started researching this I thought

86
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,220
remote access trojan was a bit of a

87
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,989
misnomer because surely all Trojans

88
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,760
require some form of remote access right

89
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,200
like if it's physical access and

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,370
certainly a Trojan you're just at the

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,839
computer so I like it it helps to think

92
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,849
about it that like a remote access

93
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,530
Trojan is a Trojan which specifically

94
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,349
goes after as much remote access as

95
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,549
possible so we're talking about almost

96
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:37,798
administrative level of control remotely

97
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,209
over a system so knowing all the

98
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,410
definitions that start with some very

99
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:47,280
very old tools a long time ago any

100
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,459
galaxy far far away Sweden started with

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,650
NAT buffs in 1998 which carl fredrik

102
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,250
nick der I hope no one's Swedish because

103
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,079
but butchered that essentially said in

104
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,150
an interview in 2002 that he created it

105
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,480
so you have fun with his or her friends

106
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,760
and for the Creator to have fun with his

107
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,198
or her friends and it's also for network

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,750
administrators that would like to remove

109
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,699
the administrator and that's quite like

110
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,079
we'll call back on this it's important

111
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:20,639
to remember that's why he says he

112
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:23,430
created it and also he claims that it is

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,870
the first tool of its type which if

114
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,789
that's correct and I couldn't find any

115
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,160
reliable examples earlier this would

116
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,229
make it the first

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,670
remote administration tool which is I

118
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,350
mean it's a good achievement I guess but

119
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,940
moving on the feature list essentially

120
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,120
it they take it uses a client-server

121
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,400
architecture so you'd install a copy of

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,320
the server binary onto a handi computer

123
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,900
and when installed it would run

124
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,290
automatically and stay and we are in the

125
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,940
memory and it would support for Windows

126
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,320
an idea it would support key keystroke

127
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,390
logging and would allow you to inject

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,550
your own keystrokes which every happen

129
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,840
does I don't know about you guys and it

130
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,180
would allow full display capture and

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,390
we're an entire file system access so

132
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,990
that's rewrite any file anyplace

133
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,700
modify anything and you know just cuz is

134
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,560
a great administrator you can open

135
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,050
includes a CD driver will which is a

136
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,460
very useful thing and it also has its

137
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,220
own tunneling protocol which enables you

138
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,780
to use any any server of this which you

139
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,350
have access to you as a proxy to connect

140
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,500
to other computers to which again

141
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,850
totally isn't malicious or anything um

142
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,700
so this is a sensor what it looks like

143
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,840
you can see on the very left ok can you

144
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,229
go to the backseat because this will be

145
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,969
useful for the rest okay cool so on the

146
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,830
left you can see a like open cd-rom you

147
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,420
essentially just pointed as a single

148
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,250
hostname or IP and click connect a

149
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,560
couple of things we can gain from this

150
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,110
is that there's no option and at least

151
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,220
not bus 1.2 to configure the exact port

152
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,380
that connects on so you know quite

153
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,110
primitive very much have fun to whether

154
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,430
it's meant for I'm an access I really

155
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,120
don't know you can also play a saw and

156
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:03,080
change the volume on the computer so

157
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,419
that kinda sums it up and it kind of

158
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,700
stockholder this one because only a year

159
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,700
later in 1989 he released nap bus Pro

160
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,669
that bus pro version 2.0 which was

161
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,960
essentially just in that bus but only if

162
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,419
you're trying to sell it to a business

163
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,849
under like things like the ability to

164
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,799
cache and store multiple servers and a

165
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,330
greater file system access and like

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,310
scripts so you can like run retains on

167
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,289
look whatever machines haven't installed

168
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,180
but of course it got quickly hacked and

169
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,410
although it was intended to be more

170
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,060
visible and it was intended to leave

171
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,430
like like like something in the taskbar

172
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,780
stuff it's very easy to remove those

173
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,120
features and then just have a better

174
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,460
version of the first remote access

175
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,290
Trojan if that makes sense

176
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,780
oh yeah and this one had webcam image

177
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,930
culture because that's what enterprises

178
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,190
are looking for I guess but although

179
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,139
we're talking a lot with the fun

180
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,969
features and high like it's such an epic

181
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,760
prank and that's sort of stuff

182
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,520
not the case like these are really

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,590
really kind of offensive tools which can

184
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,150
be used for a lot of bad so in the same

185
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,609
year that necklace 2.0 key might the

186
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,530
original program was used to frame

187
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,870
Magnus Ericsson a la researcher at Lund

188
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,099
University in Sweden for a possession of

189
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,139
three and a half thousand child

190
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,360
pornographic images and he wasn't

191
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,729
cleared until five years later when a

192
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,740
computer expert from the es offered to

193
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,289
investigate the case for him and this is

194
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,500
taken from the the newspaper in 2004 the

195
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,729
expression the district court did

196
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,620
someone to go for a control of his

197
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:37,310
computer so the advanced program that

198
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,440
bus expert expertise I guess is required

199
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,690
to use it and it is conceivable for

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
example that someone else used

201
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,539
Erickson's computer as a storage place

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,370
although it hasn't confirmed whether it

203
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,530
was just used as a proxy server or

204
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,539
whether someone had liked deliberately

205
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,179
planted there and alerted detect the

206
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,010
technicians out University so I guess

207
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,260
we'll never know moving on around the

208
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,599
same time this one's a lot more

209
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,810
well-known than that bus black orifice

210
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,700
was released the DEF CON sex by a member

211
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,800
of the prolific hacking group called to

212
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,289
the dead Cory called sir a stick so I

213
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,510
mean obviously a ministration till right

214
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,460
release the DEF CON I call to the dead

215
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,200
Cory sure but essentially a self

216
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,210
contained self installing utility which

217
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,550
allows the user to control and monitor

218
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,690
computers running running Windows

219
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:26,270
operating system over a network

220
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:31,039
Sony excuse me so essentially the

221
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:34,039
release here is very much sorry like

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,848
they advertised it sarcastically as a as

223
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,199
a remote administration tool and the

224
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,909
their motivations for it so they

225
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,650
released like a full memo detailing like

226
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,569
like what the wall black orifice could

227
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,459
do and why they were

228
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,080
lease it and essentially they had made

229
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,910
complaints to Microsoft about the

230
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,640
security of previous operating systems

231
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,740
like Windows ME and they released

232
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,230
Windows 98 which it was described here

233
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,780
as having a Swiss cheese approach to

234
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,430
security so things didn't really get

235
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,010
better and things kind of haven't really

236
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,500
got much better so I must have been on

237
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:12,000
there something shame about inspiring a

238
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,000
generation of extortion but whatever so

239
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,020
this is what it looks like kind of

240
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,640
standard Windows an idea program you can

241
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,550
see that this one does have a bit more

242
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,020
complexity than that bus whether that

243
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,849
was because it was made by someone but

244
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,380
like you knew more about computers or

245
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,300
look he was more serious by making it

246
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,370
like a proper bit of malware could be

247
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,099
used I'm not sure but essentially like

248
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,350
the same list of features with some

249
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,480
extra ones added on like for instance

250
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,190
you've got an HTTP server which you can

251
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,950
put onto the put onto the server for the

252
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,690
arbitrary uploading download of files

253
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,340
let's go to you can turn the interface

254
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,580
in the promiscuous mode and sniff all

255
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,040
the packets going through it I guess and

256
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,270
most importantly this is one to remember

257
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,800
is this does show up a lot quite

258
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,390
recently and this is the first program I

259
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,959
can find which doesn't this is a plug-in

260
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,030
interface so if let's say I use a back

261
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,460
office at home for administration and

262
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,270
I'd like to upload a custom script which

263
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,590
runs in a biophysicist hidden process I

264
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,170
can I could do so and I can dissolute it

265
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,660
too to my to my client and just run it

266
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,069
on any computer so this does instead of

267
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,300
waiting for suggest stick to add the

268
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,140
feature for me I can just make it myself

269
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,640
so that's cool and it's also it

270
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,080
advertises itself is fully invisible not

271
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,750
appearing in any tasks less or any file

272
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,690
list or any process list at all which I

273
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,000
couldn't imagine three very hard and the

274
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,890
year later just like an app bus came up

275
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,750
with a better version back office 2000

276
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,170
Kim I the next year at Def Con but the

277
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:40,090
story is essentially the same so like

278
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,630
it's like overly ganar similar

279
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:46,240
interesting the next year after that sub

280
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,860
7 was developed by mod man who's still

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,450
on he's still active in the community is

282
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,670
art Greg components whether if you'd

283
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,470
like

284
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,490
to find out more about subs Abin or more

285
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,350
about like the people and their

286
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,820
motivations for why they made this stuff

287
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,400
a lot of it today we're like software

288
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,060
freedom unlike digital advocacy which

289
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,650
doesn't make sense to me but this is

290
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,270
notable because it came with a whole

291
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,280
bunch of features this really came over

292
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,880
loaded with features compared to other

293
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,730
malware at the time and it's strived to

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,900
be the most usable remote access trojan

295
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,040
that that was on the market essentially

296
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,480
but one thing I'd like to note here is

297
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
that it was one of the most there was

298
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,930
one of the first widely used rats with

299
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,079
um command and control functionality

300
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,880
which happened three IRC and this is

301
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,320
significant because throughout the 2000s

302
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,150
this is what was used by botnets and I

303
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,860
can't find I can find one like an

304
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,900
example of a worm which is an IRC to

305
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,060
report in but in terms of like actively

306
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,170
like dishing out commands like through

307
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,339
an IRC chatroom because it's ideal for

308
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,780
it's ideal for malware authors right

309
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,490
because like IRC I mean like the

310
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,959
server's already there it's a nice

311
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,460
Vecchio's traffic and you've immediately

312
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,590
got the option to message a whole chat

313
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,210
room full of people or just a specific

314
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,490
box so that's like very easy targeting

315
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,720
for like if you want your botnets

316
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,940
additional things and this is the first

317
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,940
kind of example with it but um to

318
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,620
properly understand would like what we

319
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,450
mean about bots and like botnets and

320
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,150
rats are they also and together we need

321
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,400
to understand what a what a zombie means

322
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,199
so when we talk about botnets we

323
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,199
generally refer to Victor compromised

324
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,390
computers which make up the botnet as

325
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,120
zombies which I accept remote commands

326
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,100
all those authorization from the vault

327
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,780
herder as well or whoever's controlling

328
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,210
the botnet or rat but essentially this

329
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,870
term has kind of been forgotten install

330
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,850
victim and slave or yeast as well but of

331
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,320
course like it's just means compromised

332
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,330
computer really which brings me to my

333
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,730
next point there is although a group of

334
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,190
rock controlled zombies is a botnet

335
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,190
technically there is like technical

336
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:52,940
differences in these two terms for

337
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,380
instance as botnets scale and they're

338
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,270
designed to scale and they benefit from

339
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,860
scale for instance are used in DDoS

340
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,210
attacks and they're used for spam and

341
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,160
they're generally used for thing where

342
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,540
it's valuable to

343
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,230
a lot of different hosts doing the

344
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,889
connecting it's with the more features

345
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,720
as doesn't mention the sub 713 features

346
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,389
as a version 3.1 which is the one with

347
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,009
the IRC stuff that's not terribly useful

348
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,449
for about that because of a connective

349
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,279
return diem in fact lots and lots of

350
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,628
machines we don't want to make it we

351
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,220
want to make it as hard to detect and

352
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,329
it's hard to stop as possible and if

353
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,860
you've crammed it for the features

354
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:26,170
that's a lot of indicators compromised

355
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,509
like there's a lot of ways for that to

356
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,500
trip up where there's a lot of ways for

357
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:32,199
antiviruses to pick it up or identify

358
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,550
processes which connects to which like

359
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,339
in G your screen and that sort of thing

360
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,430
so there is a difference in the way that

361
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,500
rats and trojans the witching are

362
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:45,430
involved in botnets are used but that's

363
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,800
just semantics essentially moving on to

364
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,040
the modern day I decided to start this

365
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,839
section with like laughing you want but

366
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,849
essentially the the finding of hoc forms

367
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,019
is essentially when I would start the

368
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,850
modern day of the-- remote

369
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:04,269
administration tool market because like

370
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,589
available with like any kind of like any

371
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,910
kind of special connection or available

372
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:09,339
just to the clear now for anyone to sign

373
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,930
up to open the new members it really did

374
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,250
help develop a public interest and rats

375
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,620
in cemented there's one of the most

376
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,689
popular ways to kind of induct new black

377
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,069
lab members right because the set up or

378
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,930
more like sisters you don't really need

379
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:22,899
any like skills the tools are already

380
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,430
there I mean we'll get to some

381
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,380
technicalities with actually running a

382
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,029
campaign which which causes some

383
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,380
difficulty but essentially high

384
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,240
performance did really help to make this

385
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,009
reality because like if you give all

386
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,079
skaters the same kind of way to identify

387
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,939
themselves this creates kind of a

388
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,349
rapport between different industries so

389
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,660
for instance if I'm selling for like

390
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,310
crack to extend like selling a

391
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,290
legitimate for whatever reason hosting

392
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,550
and you're a malware developer and we

393
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,500
both are active in the same forum

394
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,849
there's an implied legitimacy there and

395
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,829
when you're trading on what is

396
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,269
essentially the Wild West and the

397
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,559
internet like anyone can scan me people

398
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:54,870
can promise stuff you can pay them and

399
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,069
another slave with money right because

400
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,040
like these these are essentially scam

401
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,449
artists we're talking about like it

402
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,490
really does help to have like one kind

403
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,079
of identity and then it obviously I'm

404
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,660
released like different like paid

405
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,758
membership tiers which indeed help to

406
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,040
drive business to the likes likes really

407
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,800
like you buy

408
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,120
level of membership and then the other

409
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,139
kind of like an implicit trust because

410
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
you've been vetted and you've paid for

411
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,480
membership so you you're not sitting to

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,250
take the money and run right but I think

413
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,800
the most important thing about this was

414
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,209
hi it made zombie monetization like a

415
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,859
reality and it made it instead of

416
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,149
something being abstract like oh I'll

417
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,740
come up with an awful way to make money

418
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,389
out of these like you can go in the

419
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,620
forum and watch people do it you can go

420
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,690
in the forum and see what people are

421
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,970
selling and you know these selling them

422
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,339
out where and you know what they what

423
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,350
they're selling from the like from the

424
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,759
zombies right so essentially when we

425
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,680
talk about matters of monetization that

426
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,660
can be summed up is they summed up in

427
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,569
what the hell would anyone do with my PC

428
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,259
if I get a virus why why do they want

429
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:57,420
the virus there except for you know fun

430
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,819
fun with your friends as a karl-frederik

431
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,240
put it why on earth would anyone want

432
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:06,240
the the malware to be there and excuse

433
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,250
me in 2009 Brian Krebs asked the same

434
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,160
question and rode around the article

435
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,360
called the scrap value of a hiked PC

436
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,490
addressing the question of like oh well

437
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,829
I only use my PC for solitaire like why

438
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,300
would you hack me and if we want users

439
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,620
to start taking security seriously and

440
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,670
if you want them to be aware of the

441
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,130
threats right there this is a really

442
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,040
important question to answer like fully

443
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,110
so forgetting targeted attacks like me

444
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,910
in fact in a specific person here's

445
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,760
here's some things which would make like

446
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,310
a a computer controlled by rap pretty

447
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,319
valuable so sort of a web hosting so the

448
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,899
value here is the anonymity it delivers

449
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,189
to the attacker so for instance I can

450
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,300
sell you a posting and you can host

451
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,220
whatever you want on it and it doesn't

452
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,359
matter if it goes doreen because there's

453
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,750
no way to tie you back to the original

454
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,519
hosting right except for me and this is

455
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,949
the CDs for lots of stuff so like

456
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,529
fashion campaigns will use this malware

457
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:57,359
hosting so if you're um if part of your

458
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,370
fetching campaign is to download malware

459
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,870
from a site the site can be hosted here

460
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,519
in that way you know you're not getting

461
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,750
blacklisted from hosting domains or

462
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,939
getting arrested because she signed up

463
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,459
with it in a real name which does happen

464
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,299
um you can host wares on it and again

465
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,280
illegal pornography

466
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,510
people will pay a lot of money to like

467
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,470
host this kind of stuff if you can do

468
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:19,109
reliably so like why not focus in on the

469
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,189
right campaign essentially next up is

470
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,109
something guys some of us might be

471
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,449
familiar with virtual goods

472
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,829
so online games now I have like trading

473
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,899
features and lighting in order to get

474
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,668
people to play nice and in order to and

475
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:31,199
devise people playing the game you'll

476
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,119
get items which are sometimes worth

477
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,919
real-life money and this didn't rinse

478
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,928
from like developer sanctioned

479
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,409
activities like like the state market

480
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,460
and condor strike in team fortress t2

481
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,919
economies which aren't supposed to be a

482
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,399
really like have real life value but do

483
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,809
anyway

484
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,789
like for instance you've got a rinse

485
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:50,639
cape and so on and so forth um and a

486
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,408
nice benefit of this is that they're

487
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:53,850
owned predominantly by children like

488
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:56,159
these are people who don't really have

489
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,719
not much or young adults are best sorry

490
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,399
they like this they don't really have

491
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,049
that much knowledge about computers like

492
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,129
generally do have that much money so

493
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,158
they're the type of person to search in

494
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:06,389
the youtube free free cabo credits or so

495
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,029
on and so forth and you'll see a lot of

496
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:12,299
a lot of hosting or a lot of spreading

497
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:13,919
of the bar word on there and essentially

498
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,529
those are then taken from the accounts

499
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,179
which have per authentication and like

500
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,379
like if like if you think about it your

501
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,720
statement kind is less protected than

502
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:23,219
your bank accounts and i can sell my i

503
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,629
can sell the same items to anyone right

504
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,190
so instead of there being like an actual

505
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:29,189
paper trail of me funding money out of

506
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,810
your account like valve has a good luck

507
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,159
support

508
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,730
[Music]

509
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,440
next up reputation hijacking so way back

510
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,749
in the day this was essentially when

511
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,399
spammers find a way to amass sign up for

512
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:43,830
yahoo accounts or hotmail accounts and

513
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:46,619
then use the inherent validity of a

514
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,899
hotmail account because like different

515
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:52,080
like web mail hosts would trust these

516
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:56,129
addresses more given that they caesar

517
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,539
given they had like like security behind

518
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,100
signing up and they had spam detection

519
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,690
that sort of thing so if you find a way

520
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,639
to actually sign up to these addresses

521
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,139
that was really good for getting your

522
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:06,559
spam seen by as many people as possible

523
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:08,668
but nowadays with social media

524
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,710
reputation hijacking essentially means

525
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:12,539
when you take over someones a current

526
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,889
which usually identifies them like for

527
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,509
instance if you go on any social media

528
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:17,609
or any forum site and you see a post

529
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:19,499
from someone who's not in current

530
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,119
there's a lot inherent value of what

531
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:22,830
they post based on who they are so if

532
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,119
like if i had to try the generation

533
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,439
current and i posted someone like people

534
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,488
are going to trust that length more than

535
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,129
if i push it on my own

536
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:32,249
twitter because like there's like she's

537
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,658
got much more to lose than i so um rats

538
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:34,930
have been spread in order to get access

539
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,720
to high value socially

540
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,510
- which can be used in further malware

541
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,160
spreading or indeed advertising services

542
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,080
other advertising services is much less

543
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
profitable than horse or sorry selling

544
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,620
advertising services on still many kinds

545
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
as much less profitable just spreading

546
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,969
more malware so it's become much more

547
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,689
common excuse me

548
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,950
and up next probably the biggest thing

549
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,740
with widespread one would be credential

550
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,020
stealing so essentially get around

551
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,430
you're on your computer take all the

552
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,110
passwords on them and anything which can

553
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,000
be used to process money or deliver

554
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,040
value to the person running the botnet

555
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,900
they'll just tick so this isn't limited

556
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,280
although they obviously would prefer for

557
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,320
them to like fund sale of access to your

558
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,850
to your savings that love access to your

559
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,649
mind the kind they love all that it's

560
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,820
not just limited to coins actually store

561
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,290
money occurrence which you use the

562
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,659
process money in general do you have an

563
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,550
inherent value because of the capacity

564
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,990
for money laundering and because the the

565
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,120
value of an account used for legitimate

566
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,620
reasons is so much more is so much

567
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,239
higher than just and I find it's just

568
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,790
been made right because if I make an

569
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,140
offender then immediately use it to sell

570
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,340
something worth a thousand times off

571
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,990
someone else he just made an account

572
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,580
like but there's like there are fraud

573
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,350
prevention and then these types of

574
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,540
programs so this does help to evade

575
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,040
those and that's like an think for

576
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,379
examples those to be eBay and Skrill

577
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,710
much both for problems so that kind of

578
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,270
behavior and leaving the worst for last

579
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,500
we've got extortion so I'm sure

580
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,300
everyone's familiar will run somewhere

581
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,160
ransomware is much more common than

582
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,560
relaxed estrogens because like there's

583
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,660
no management involved you just kind of

584
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,070
sell of a key experience ended I someone

585
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,600
downloads and all of a sudden they have

586
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,970
to pay you or it's you know they're not

587
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,379
getting their stuff back but we like

588
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,060
with our devices and we trust them with

589
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,700
a lot of very sensitive stuff so it

590
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,950
doesn't have to just be like we'll get

591
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,720
access to your system like you can use I

592
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,040
can I get into ten extent blackmail you

593
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,290
can find something that they do not want

594
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,970
all right and use the secrecy of this to

595
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,290
their demand money of them so I don't

596
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,520
know if anyone remembers but early

597
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,250
examples around somewhere I would say

598
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,480
that oh the FBI is detected child

599
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,190
pornography on your computer and then

600
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,540
actually give me five hundred dollars of

601
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,000
iTunes vouchers you're going to go to

602
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,920
jail like that sort of stuff and like

603
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,870
the data is very much coming from these

604
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,280
practices like other ransomware has

605
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,629
existed for a while something unpopular

606
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,980
recently and this practice definitely

607
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,570
predates it to a large extent

608
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,860
and so if if you can't hold the system

609
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,510
ransom the my name LeConte like again

610
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,428
going back to social media some social

611
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,870
medias are the basis of people's

612
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,880
businesses some like social media

613
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,520
accounts or clients on external services

614
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,690
like the person needs otherwise they

615
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,000
will not be able to make their living

616
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,140
and so there's there's value to that so

617
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,970
if they can lock you out of your email

618
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,620
and lock you out of your Twitter then

619
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,030
like it's gonna be hard to get your

620
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,909
account pack and rather than wait 30

621
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,559
days for Twitter support pay $200 get a

622
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,990
box I guess

623
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,549
and finally webcam extortion which is

624
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,770
quite a big one because obviously like

625
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,389
anyone can set up one of these campaigns

626
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,190
it's not because you can just download

627
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,350
it for free on the internet there's not

628
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,000
really not everyone tried to make money

629
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,178
there like there are an awful lot of

630
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,010
just very very sick people for instance

631
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,350
like webcam extortion so I'm attempting

632
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,730
to I get lewd photos off someone's

633
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,168
webcam without them knowing it's on and

634
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,090
then using those images to extort and

635
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:43,280
further it's very very common and indeed

636
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,760
you can see that mirrored and in the

637
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,320
forms of today so if if you can't read

638
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,169
that it essentially it's advertising

639
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,928
ebooks and services for getting teenage

640
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,000
girls and young women to install your

641
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:58,610
remote access trojan because these

642
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,679
instances of the sprouting are worth

643
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,490
more and can be sold to more people and

644
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,910
if you're not going to use them yourself

645
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,470
someone else certainly will so rather

646
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:11,240
that obviously sucks but that's

647
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:12,500
a should inspire but that's a I like

648
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,390
this part and parcel of this kind of

649
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,280
what this kind of access attracts that

650
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,780
people aren't just here to make money or

651
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,639
just throw people are here to make money

652
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,899
in any way they can and generally if

653
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,130
they're willing to take access to your

654
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,600
entire computer without you knowing

655
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,330
they're not really that bothered about

656
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,580
extortion either so let's say we've got

657
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:31,100
Indiana coin we've made all this money

658
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,210
were like okay what's the point like it

659
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,350
doesn't really scale like yeah I just

660
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,110
keep making this I went to money forever

661
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,090
well as Homer right you put said money

662
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,040
can be exchanged for goods and services

663
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,340
and we can actually make our malware

664
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,780
better not only by like like buying a

665
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,939
premium version but we can also employ

666
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,760
services by like tangentially related

667
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,520
but different industry or different

668
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,379
markets of blackhat to make our malware

669
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,779
more successful to make it spread faster

670
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,429
so

671
00:23:55,779 --> 00:24:02,200
Yashin actually been earlier but if if

672
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,429
you've ever even following there might

673
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,230
be a couple of things too from your head

674
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,429
like oh well if they're just using all

675
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,779
these free tools well then the anti

676
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:13,230
viruses can block the free tools and

677
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:16,029
I'll be safe right well yes but also new

678
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,039
so the idea here is that while the

679
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,990
viruses can block them and then it takes

680
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,139
longer to make it to make a remote

681
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,970
access Trojan than it does to like block

682
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:28,570
one so eventually will keep up with the

683
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,179
tide not quite so crypting is

684
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,668
essentially the encryption i've also

685
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,230
referred to as packing but for um for

686
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,519
doing it for malicious purposes it's

687
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,700
generally referred to in the market as

688
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,169
crypting it's essentially the process of

689
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,539
obscuring an executable in order to

690
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,610
prevent detection of the malicious code

691
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:49,658
in so corrupters of various functions

692
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:52,870
but like the core of it is popping under

693
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,960
film familiar popping is shorthand for

694
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,678
executable compression which is on

695
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,299
compressing the file and then

696
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,809
decompressing it in memory once it's a

697
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:03,549
once it's wrong so generally in Windows

698
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,340
the encrypted code exists as a PE

699
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,168
resource within within the binary which

700
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,519
is then so the the sort of the program

701
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,000
is essentially the instructions on how

702
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,519
to unpack the the program and then the

703
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,649
rest is just on the run the rest is this

704
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,509
nonsense until it's uncompressed right

705
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:22,239
so while parking has legitimate uses

706
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:24,009
like blackman memory wasn't really that

707
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,419
it was much more scarce than it was

708
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:26,769
everything will be packed because you're

709
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:28,570
trying to cram as much on your floppy

710
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,190
disk as you're on right like if you've

711
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,509
only got like 64 K of memory you don't

712
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,429
want something taking up space just

713
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:35,590
because it's more legitimate right like

714
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:37,990
even Sophos distributed its own

715
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,000
antivirus fully packed so we've said on

716
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,090
a floppy disk because things used to run

717
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,059
faster on floppy disks have been told

718
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:47,259
but essentially why it works is the the

719
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,668
the program will start at a launch and

720
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:55,570
unpacking routine which will be pointed

721
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:57,549
at a pace of a malicious code and then

722
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,129
it'll just hand over control to that

723
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:03,490
malicious code wants to compact and no

724
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:07,689
one will be any other wiser so

725
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:09,490
sorry excuse me of course it doesn't

726
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,890
it's not just a simple there are various

727
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,149
levels of sophistication and because we

728
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,010
have various levels of sophisticated

729
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,899
actors a lot of them are commonly used

730
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,610
so we'll start with the very very basic

731
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:20,049
ones which are easy for antiviruses to

732
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,969
catch on to and then we'll go up to

733
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,440
relate ridiculous lots and lots of

734
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,750
effort I want to stay undetected for the

735
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,760
rest of my life edge stuff so you can

736
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,870
use open source placards but and on the

737
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,250
plus side they're available for free

738
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,110
right so you're not paying any one more

739
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,789
that profit to yourself good job

740
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,639
on the downside they're available for

741
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:38,080
free so like everyone else can download

742
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,429
them as well and when you're in an arms

743
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,870
race with an antivirus company you

744
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,510
probably shouldn't give your secret key

745
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,100
to not being detected to them so anti

746
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,750
viruses of had access to the source code

747
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,770
for ages which makes detecting them

748
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,159
pretty trivial it's just you know

749
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:54,309
finding out other pipes and then like

750
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,779
applying that to to the files you're

751
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,668
scanning excuse me

752
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,200
next up the wrong you can pay for a

753
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:00,909
crippling service so on a public forum

754
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,960
someone elaborate eyes hi guys have been

755
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,610
equipped there and if you want to

756
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,320
encrypt your files you can either pay

757
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,729
for access per month or you can pay for

758
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,439
access as you go so you can pay per

759
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,470
crept usually a couple of couple of

760
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,760
pennies like 50 P or 20 P or whatever so

761
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,679
the source code will be generally

762
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,120
attempt to be made unavailable so you

763
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,669
won't have access to a list of access to

764
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,049
the cryptid files so the AV has to

765
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:21,760
reverse-engineer samples and that takes

766
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,879
time that more time than it would to

767
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,440
find out exactly how to block or buy

768
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,549
over rats which are entirely unpacked so

769
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,500
it'll also contain on the analysis

770
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,179
features that'll obfuscate the stub and

771
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,529
by stub I mean that bit of code at the

772
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,840
start which is uncompressed which is

773
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:40,179
essentially instructions on how to

774
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,649
decompress the rest and it'll behave

775
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,809
differently if it notices it's in a

776
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:46,120
sandbox or VM so that's not about

777
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,710
specific that's very common so semi

778
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,389
aware and encrypted obviously can be

779
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:53,320
Kryptos obviously can be used anywhere

780
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,850
not just with relaxed estrogens so next

781
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,610
a lot either private corrupting services

782
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,260
so instead of um instead of selling like

783
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,510
individual licenses or individual crypts

784
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,429
you sell spots on a program so there's a

785
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,080
there's limited access and this is

786
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,549
entirely intentional because the idea is

787
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,320
if not many people are using it there's

788
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:09,879
not gonna be that many samples so if

789
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,428
I've got a really important thing I want

790
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,720
to put a virus on or a piece of malware

791
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:16,029
I'm sorry then I can

792
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,590
that won't be detected right but the

793
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:19,330
downside is you actually think this has

794
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,730
actually cost money price goes

795
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,049
significantly up to to the suitor how

796
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,629
the business works was limited in winter

797
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,470
spots but the idea here is it'll be

798
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:29,230
updated regularly

799
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,700
so hopefully evade detection for longer

800
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,919
and it'll how you generally have more

801
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,389
advanced the analysis features like

802
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,370
it'll obfuscate the control flow when

803
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:39,279
that's being reversed in the API and so

804
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,320
on and so forth and right at the top the

805
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,870
ground of the crime not universally

806
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,789
available and used for the general

807
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,518
applications as well as a virtualized

808
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:50,019
exe obfuscator which essentially instead

809
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,000
of decrypting the code it just runs it

810
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:54,549
in a virtual machine which has an

811
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,929
architecture which is not like any of

812
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:57,070
the architectures we use so if you're

813
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:59,259
reversing it you need to learn an

814
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,509
entirely new control set or command set

815
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,740
and so on and so forth so like if you're

816
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,179
trying to reverse this for answers that

817
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,220
can be quite a pain it can take much

818
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:07,899
much much longer so this is kind of what

819
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,730
you're aiming for but obviously it costs

820
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:10,928
significantly more than the other

821
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,059
options and generally if you're just

822
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:14,049
you're just doing it to scam a few

823
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,730
prints kippur coins

824
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,850
you wouldn't year like you wouldn't need

825
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:21,250
users so let's pretend they've done all

826
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,799
that ok so I've got my rat I've got my

827
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,090
I've got it encrypted ID I even know if

828
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,408
it works right because I'd like I don't

829
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,059
want to just burn all my crepes by

830
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:29,980
testing if my rat works you know like I

831
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,240
don't want to see I like I do want to

832
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,519
drop it on the alive system it gets

833
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,230
detected and then suddenly I'm not like

834
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,779
I've I've lost that spreading mechanism

835
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,700
or something so if you're thinking a

836
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,080
service like virus toodle we are half

837
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,970
right it would be great if we had

838
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,610
services where we could just show them

839
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,100
our out and it would give us the the

840
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,809
detection rate back and virus to do that

841
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,360
however it also provides callbacks to

842
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,100
the antivirus companies so not ideal if

843
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,299
I'm a malware author and I'm testing new

844
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,279
types of corrupting and I'm just sending

845
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:58,870
my sample but cryptid in various

846
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,669
different ways directly to the antivirus

847
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,199
company that's generally what we want to

848
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,240
avoid so what if we made our room

849
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,830
service what and it did the same thing

850
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,309
as virustotal but only it didn't send

851
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,178
them back

852
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:12,158
well we're 12 years late as the clangor

853
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,840
antivirus services which essentially are

854
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,850
kills which can be best described as

855
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,279
mimicking the services virus to the

856
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,870
provides but only running the device

857
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,519
tools in the sandbox when they are

858
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,049
little more into it which stops it

859
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,120
calling back to the original service are

860
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:31,389
used to determine how good

861
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,399
my crypt is and essentially this has

862
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,720
happened quite a few times the most one

863
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,830
of the most recently most notable cases

864
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,570
was referred about me started in 2011

865
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,070
ended in 2015 because it's still illegal

866
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,990
even if you're not the person holding

867
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,649
the malware itself if you enable and

868
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,170
make money off hackers you're at best an

869
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,760
accomplice and worst a bit of a scumbag

870
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,160
so two charges of the computer misuse

871
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,590
Act and interestingly enough one charge

872
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,550
of money laundering because I guess like

873
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,899
that's what they care about right like

874
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,810
don't care if you're making money so uh

875
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,120
the NCA reported 1.2 million scans using

876
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,280
the service in the time it was a made

877
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,669
available so I mean with a better room

878
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,220
for error

879
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,290
it's like 1.2 million scans or with our

880
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,450
1.2 million bits of malware which had

881
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,790
been analyzed or different definitely

882
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,250
corrupted malware which is quite a scale

883
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,659
and interestingly enough was noticed by

884
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:24,280
train right group because the service

885
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:26,440
also offered a URL sorry domain and IP

886
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,090
reputation checking so of course in the

887
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,040
same service because you paid for one

888
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,560
you also get reputation checking thrown

889
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,570
in and of course they noticed that there

890
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,870
was reputation checks coming from this

891
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,540
IP I'm not I'm not like the actual virus

892
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,879
callbacks since who logins the fact that

893
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:46,420
their products were being used

894
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,580
maliciously so so let's say I've cryptid

895
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,770
my software I've I know it works

896
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,240
I know it's undetected so how do I know

897
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,370
if anyone will fall for right because

898
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,200
like the way I've spread like how we

899
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,580
spread malware changes as fast as human

900
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,560
interests change right like people might

901
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,090
want to download free fortnight V Buck

902
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,080
generator today but they might not want

903
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,399
the done with it tomorrow and I don't

904
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,199
want to spend all my time searching on

905
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,730
what the kids are doing these days so of

906
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,550
course I can this go on high form the

907
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,620
game and find no that's tiny and they do

908
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,889
apologize but essentially it's various

909
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:17,050
different guides and services for for

910
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,680
how to spread your malware promising

911
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:23,139
arranged from hundreds plus to thirty to

912
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,760
fifty five downloads per day so I mean

913
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,140
they like it instead of you figuring

914
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,430
right okay how do I spread this and how

915
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,230
do I make the pantsing you just pay

916
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,940
someone to do that for you stick your

917
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,360
execute upon it and send it off away you

918
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,470
go so like upload upload sites good are

919
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,479
in contents like its content

920
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,370
sites get moderated and of course like

921
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,620
the metrics for actual monetization

922
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,299
change so for instance with the steam

923
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,120
trading it used to be very much that I'm

924
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:49,250
if I scan the knife of someone on hunger

925
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,039
strike I'd be able to sell it no problem

926
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,510
on multiple sites but now to trade

927
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,190
statement forces two-factor

928
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,309
authentication and its moves like these

929
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,380
which really stop remote access Trojan

930
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,000
authors and like people who are trying

931
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,220
to make money to this it's essentially

932
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,140
as our security gets better the like

933
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,030
opportunity gets lower in the word for

934
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,909
opportunistic scams like this so that's

935
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,700
kind of the that's a lesson to take away

936
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:15,590
from this certainly and finally

937
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,740
something that people struggle with

938
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,230
because you've got like OPSEC is like

939
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,480
essentially a universal problem for for

940
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,220
all black hats it's and he like no

941
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,539
matter what you do it's not worth very

942
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,620
much so you get caught right like you're

943
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,000
like you're not a millionaire in prison

944
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:35,090
well depending on where you live but

945
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,679
whether it's running Skype Skype support

946
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,750
accounts for their malware signed up to

947
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,480
their own email address or running a new

948
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:45,710
IP service off their home reader they're

949
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,080
not very good at it so how do we

950
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:51,770
actually know how do we how do they get

951
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,270
better other I'm the I I hope they feel

952
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,520
forever that I don't know how to get

953
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,370
better other I don't I don't want them

954
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,168
to know really as the people who make

955
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,610
these not like just to be clear the

956
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:03,520
people who make these malware and the

957
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,439
people who support them three businesses

958
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,330
which enable like which enable catch

959
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,339
exfiltration or businesses which enable

960
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,909
log less hosting or businesses which

961
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:15,320
enable essentially like free like free

962
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,629
EULA software which totally is in the

963
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,500
malware like I mean they're all they're

964
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:20,509
all cut from the same cloth

965
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,909
they're all just enabling vulnerable

966
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,089
people on online getting scammed and

967
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,470
like a mess we do something about it

968
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:30,918
nothing's really going to win is this

969
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:32,118
being recorded it is right well I mean

970
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,129
if you're if you're a block caught

971
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:40,570
watching get a job seriously so moving

972
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:44,600
roughly on.com it was developed in 2008

973
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:48,350
until 2012 by dark cooler SC

974
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,440
active still not arrested I I guess and

975
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,489
had seventy thousand users added to peak

976
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,810
but essentially he's quoted as saying

977
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,100
that the whole development process of

978
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,279
dark comment was just a challenge for

979
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,630
myself and he had no issues developing

980
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,890
and providing support for skids and what

981
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,090
we going to go too much into the tech of

982
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,990
the technical details which are common

983
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,850
because we're really seen it was sub

984
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,450
seven essentially programs are do get

985
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,069
very Sammy

986
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,169
so instead of going through each one

987
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,780
individually although I'll provide run

988
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,600
at the end so for four years do thousand

989
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:17,120
Ania to actually you know for six years

990
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,890
he be he provided support for this well

991
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,540
for no problem the fact that it was

992
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,859
being abused I guess I mean in writing

993
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,650
had a problem but he also earn two

994
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,230
thousand euros providing support for for

995
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,370
for combat through the years so not

996
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,590
enough of a problem did not take money

997
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:35,870
off my desk and then suddenly and then

998
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:37,670
2014 this happened so it is with deep

999
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,920
regret that I'm here to announce the end

1000
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,840
of project dark comic rat after over

1001
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,020
four years in development hard work day

1002
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,310
and night to offer you free at will with

1003
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,440
the well to make communities

1004
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:53,330
expectations of a program of type remote

1005
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,940
administration till I have devoted years

1006
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,590
with a nonprofit philosophy for you to

1007
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,400
enjoy without asking anything in return

1008
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,510
other than respect of the rules

1009
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,070
unfortunately some of you couldn't

1010
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,650
respect the terms so because of you

1011
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:10,460
generally speaking mid dar common route

1012
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,360
and so sad story involved just trying to

1013
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,890
help people whether this remote

1014
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,110
administration tool and a lot bunch of

1015
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,940
bad people use the features built into

1016
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,130
the program to in fact people's

1017
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,010
computers let them knowing happens to

1018
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,270
the best of us I guess so something

1019
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,380
that's right at the end there and I've

1020
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,880
highlighted at the talks and gets

1021
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,920
important without mentioning what

1022
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,420
happened in Syria and I guess that must

1023
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,040
be French for oops a hostile dictator

1024
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,090
government used my tool to target

1025
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,560
journalists within the country and

1026
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,360
disabled their computers and stop them

1027
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,570
from telling people about what was

1028
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,980
happening so I mean I thought I don't

1029
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,740
know why closed either if anyone if

1030
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,410
anyone knows do something I'm a rough at

1031
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,459
the same time created in 2010 was black

1032
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,359
shirts and black sheets it's quite

1033
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:56,120
famous here's how did that if anyone

1034
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,400
okay cool and bloodless new info so

1035
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,380
available for forty

1036
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,110
I sighed I signed out forms and pay

1037
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:06,160
someone $40 and I get a month of support

1038
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:07,870
and this that's rap for and any future

1039
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,549
updates it gets so essentially what

1040
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,770
we're saying with advertising support

1041
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,240
they are kind of going after the lowest

1042
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,530
common denominator here they are selling

1043
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,180
it there active these targets people

1044
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,370
they don't know how to set up a remote

1045
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,040
administration tool so I mean short of

1046
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,569
them being you know the Red Hat of the

1047
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,130
rap industry like this is it's very

1048
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,050
clear who they want to use this program

1049
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:30,570
and I'll give you a hint it's not

1050
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,570
seasoned you know network administrators

1051
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,820
but essentially came in three versions

1052
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,010
blotches net which is made in VB and

1053
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,740
lots and lots of features loathsome just

1054
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,120
as only a sub seven if not more and

1055
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,950
hardware ID locked so once you bought it

1056
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,630
is like you couldn't use not licensed

1057
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:49,299
anywhere else in an attempt to make more

1058
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:51,160
money arson and black she'd stealth

1059
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,960
which is made in Java a much smaller bug

1060
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,029
featured and way way way less features

1061
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,040
but essentially like basic remote access

1062
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,990
features and all the communication was

1063
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,850
encrypted so I guess if that was more

1064
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,259
suited to your needs then go for that it

1065
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,299
was also slightly cheaper I think but

1066
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,050
let's have a look black kids and that

1067
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,880
seemed save architecture the same

1068
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,960
architecture as an app bus I mean and

1069
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,580
this is like 12 years later so cold I

1070
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,260
guess it was a you could either use a

1071
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,290
web or application based or come on the

1072
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,580
control framework for yourself and one

1073
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,960
thing is interesting about I'd like to

1074
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,120
note was a lot of routes at this time

1075
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,630
calm included offered a customizable

1076
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,509
payload creation so excuse me when

1077
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:33,720
you're when you're making a server to

1078
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,800
tip it on to one of your machines I hope

1079
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,689
it gives you a whole bunch of options

1080
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,910
like you could specify the IP connection

1081
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,580
port the transport profiles you could

1082
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,700
name the server you could tell you can

1083
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,560
tell what found in and mutex so if

1084
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,350
you're this important so if you're

1085
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,180
sending a version of your route to your

1086
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,370
big list of machines you're ready I'm

1087
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,100
accessory you can put a new taxing and

1088
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:59,830
then if a binary if the same mutex is

1089
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,319
already running then it won't run twice

1090
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,569
and give you two versions of access to

1091
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,040
the same machine so like that it's it's

1092
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,290
clear that this was intended at some

1093
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,759
stage for like bats usage like for the

1094
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,910
control lots and lots of machines not

1095
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,570
just like a few

1096
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:16,700
on your estate so know the language

1097
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,300
language used at the bottom there in

1098
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:22,490
fact that's one GSB helps with spreading

1099
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,580
as we know as we know what spreading is

1100
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:27,259
that's kind of word like what we the

1101
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,460
term we use and we describe like trying

1102
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,740
to get your malware under someone else's

1103
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,910
computers or a method so I'll strike two

1104
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:39,470
and makes your server appear to be a

1105
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:41,779
normal file strike three malware so one

1106
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,549
- I like what Satori mentioned at the

1107
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,470
end there they are clone file tool which

1108
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,470
makes sure to look like a similar file

1109
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,759
so here we have on the Left people the

1110
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,480
back you have to take my word for it but

1111
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,760
on the Left we have we have essentially

1112
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,010
a normal notepad.exe and on the right we

1113
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,600
have the fake no pot Exe and you can

1114
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,240
replace the icon separately so it would

1115
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,589
look exactly like the normal notepad but

1116
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,450
only it would just be 300 kilobytes

1117
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,680
larger so like I don't know about you

1118
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,950
but I wouldn't say that if it somewhere

1119
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,790
managed to go on my computer you know so

1120
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,319
I'm just like every other piece of

1121
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,140
malware uses the registry it's

1122
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,490
extensively to identify the payload to

1123
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,259
ensure like persistence through reboot

1124
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,700
to open up for open a new firewall rule

1125
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,120
so it wouldn't pop up with something's

1126
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,939
trying to connect but sort of stuff very

1127
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:33,049
silent worked very well at the time or

1128
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,250
so Akamai says so once let's say I in

1129
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,720
fact someone successfully it makes the

1130
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,220
firewall really connects right this is

1131
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,259
what I'd see essentially what we're

1132
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,439
looking at there's a big potential list

1133
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,090
box full from full of server details and

1134
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,730
we've got the options to ping quick

1135
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,530
search map view resolve host name and

1136
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,900
then the categories of surveillance

1137
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:53,720
network system on miscellaneous so on

1138
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,520
server as well and you can also there's

1139
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,049
also chatroom I'm not sure if I allows

1140
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,480
you to chat with the person on the other

1141
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:03,110
side but that would be pretty creepy to

1142
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,400
me it enables persistence or it enables

1143
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,490
you to access all of the events which

1144
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,820
happen all of the click and keyboard

1145
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,020
events which are using system-wide hooks

1146
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,430
so anything that's typed on any

1147
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,960
application you immediately get access

1148
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,600
to and I assume I can botch it off and

1149
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,750
send it to wherever you wanted and

1150
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,540
looking a bit know I once identify yeah

1151
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,600
so looking a bit and

1152
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,340
the features so system essentially like

1153
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,250
if we think back to necklaces features

1154
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,020
exactly the same features so like I

1155
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,120
think we're correct in saying the

1156
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,650
necklace was the first but a full access

1157
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,069
to the files for access the project

1158
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,750
processes registry everything basically

1159
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,700
and then these are these features at the

1160
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,860
bottom were used to if you ever would

1161
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,710
like let's say if I infected someone in

1162
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,240
January and then by March the krypter I

1163
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,620
used to close darling and I wasn't sure

1164
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,600
if it was going to be valid for very

1165
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,850
longer I could just crept a new file and

1166
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,170
then send them to all of my existing

1167
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,779
people had infected and then all of a

1168
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,610
sudden my with limited downtime I mean

1169
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,710
obviously the effectiveness of the stuff

1170
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:05,560
varies but um what a limited time time

1171
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,260
I'm essentially got a new got any

1172
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,930
connection so that's cool and then

1173
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,640
finally like every other legitimate

1174
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:15,640
access tool we've got Steve Micawber a

1175
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,420
fund manager spreading file hijacker

1176
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:22,120
cookie manager and odd clicker so again

1177
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:26,200
the more methods of more methods of

1178
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,549
monetization therefore before obviously

1179
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,319
people looking to make money out of

1180
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,450
these machines is infected so everything

1181
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,830
kind of pointing that being nada oh yeah

1182
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:39,100
in his back so not really not really

1183
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:41,549
gentleman at all and what could happen

1184
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,770
such a great feel very very future risk

1185
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:46,270
very feature-rich very unlike it were

1186
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,690
very well people pay for that great

1187
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,300
support

1188
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:57,910
what could possibly possibly go wrong

1189
00:42:49,300 --> 00:43:00,760
next only the biggest malware take turn

1190
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,160
off the time so far with I think there

1191
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,960
was 50 raids in the u.s. 90 in Europe or

1192
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,790
Europol kid an idea I'm not sure what

1193
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,400
their jurisdiction is but essentially

1194
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:11,550
everyone who was anyone involved in the

1195
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,600
core Blackshades industry got taken down

1196
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:18,100
and why then that's my question why not

1197
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,630
all of them are all the routes before

1198
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,850
them well how to think about it and

1199
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,980
write its life so starting in 2010

1200
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,960
remember it was again used in Syria and

1201
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,180
a great source to check out about the

1202
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,430
use of like commercial malware tools and

1203
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,529
then places like Syria citizen lab he

1204
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,390
did great great work in that area by

1205
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,690
keeping keeping us up-to-date with what

1206
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,520
preference we're using so

1207
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:42,250
like their tactics and seizures in Seoul

1208
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:45,470
so forth and then in I think it was 20

1209
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:47,480
only 12 may miss teen USA candidate was

1210
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,549
um was infected with one of these rats

1211
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,440
and it was actually a victim of

1212
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,760
sextortion so essentially they took

1213
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,380
compromising photos of her using the

1214
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,300
webcam and demanded more otherwise

1215
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,890
they'd release the photos she said no

1216
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,770
one went to the media about it and the

1217
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,060
he got arrested so he choked her but I

1218
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,829
think the main thing that made back to

1219
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,210
it's different was that it was run not

1220
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,130
only in conjunction with other black cup

1221
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:10,819
businesses and that should be businesses

1222
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,230
not business but you know that was also

1223
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:15,740
a business and its own right like

1224
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:17,000
between 2010 and April 2014 according to

1225
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,379
justice sakarov they made over three

1226
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,089
hundred and fifty thousand dollars with

1227
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,579
the seals and like I know it's not much

1228
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:23,839
over four years like I mean especially

1229
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,420
when you know you go to jail at Leon fit

1230
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,650
and fun it's like it's it's certainly a

1231
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,349
significant amount and if we're talking

1232
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:33,020
about like a industry which is

1233
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:34,760
essentially kept afloat by children like

1234
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,329
that's a significant amount of money

1235
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,460
stolen you know so the list goes on

1236
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:44,329
there's far too many more examples to

1237
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:47,329
talk about so NJ rot is another another

1238
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:49,369
notable example made in 2012 in Asia

1239
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:52,670
loves it it's it's all over the place in

1240
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:54,560
China and India and this neutral partly

1241
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,450
because Microsoft took down four million

1242
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,400
IP addresses related to the service in

1243
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,560
new IP much essentially if I want to run

1244
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,079
malware from my home computer because I

1245
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,170
don't think much what I can do is I can

1246
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,390
get I can use a service like no IP which

1247
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,970
will then attach my rigor to your demand

1248
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,470
and then I can just access my my IP

1249
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,839
through that domain rather than like

1250
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,140
having to change the IP I'm using every

1251
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:19,160
15 minutes so of course Microsoft once

1252
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,470
there was there was a big spike in usage

1253
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,089
and Microsoft reacted by taking four

1254
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,759
million accounts or four million

1255
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:28,759
addresses offline which is I mean all of

1256
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,109
the software advocates immediately got

1257
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,730
very up in arms about it and said well

1258
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,619
it's it's awful the one company can do

1259
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,349
that

1260
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:38,589
I can use my malware anymore so that was

1261
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:40,239
sad and then luminosity like made a lot

1262
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:43,180
of money as well Colton grubs

1263
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:45,519
his name was so he launched his malware

1264
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,399
and then offered support by the name

1265
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,288
under the name of KFC watermelon on hack

1266
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,150
forms so you can tell it literal I think

1267
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:57,670
it was literally 17 and he signed up for

1268
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,489
his official platform Skype account at

1269
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:04,390
Colton grubs gmail.com and got caught

1270
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:06,099
Wow so that's essentially we're all

1271
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,410
caught up so what do we learn from this

1272
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,819
like a what now I know how a broad

1273
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,249
industry propagated and how it started

1274
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:14,199
and he supports it know why they did how

1275
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:15,669
do we fight this right like hide away as

1276
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,539
in preset professionals and students and

1277
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,150
people who want to be part of the

1278
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:21,339
industry how do we make the world safer

1279
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,309
right so I mean what can go after the

1280
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:25,180
profit motive but the journalist I don't

1281
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:26,709
think that tells much because people

1282
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,390
have things of value that's kind of

1283
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:30,038
inherent otherwise we wouldn't have it

1284
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,558
let's go I don't think that's

1285
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,299
incentivizing I'd like I don't think

1286
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,799
it's like no way this is a technical

1287
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:37,900
problem first and foremost I feel like

1288
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:40,179
any norms risks of Bagdad companies

1289
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,559
versus tiny crypto authors I don't think

1290
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:43,299
we're gonna win so I feel like if we

1291
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,339
could try and disincentivizes it once as

1292
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:46,749
possible so collaboration with law

1293
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,949
enforcement from the likes of Trend

1294
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:50,078
Micro and companies to bring these

1295
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:52,660
people to justice and for making making

1296
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,009
it very clear that if you're going to

1297
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,509
have any success at all you will be

1298
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:57,729
caught because I think the p.m. point

1299
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:59,859
here is transferring that wealth from

1300
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:02,109
prospective wealth online from control

1301
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:04,660
of accounts into like real-world money

1302
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:05,920
and you know food my god if we can make

1303
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,538
that as difficult as possible I feel

1304
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,140
like we can really strike at the heart

1305
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:13,299
of this and stopping the hustle and NCAA

1306
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,650
has started to prevent program recently

1307
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:16,479
which is essentially in line with what

1308
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,089
with the last point there we need to

1309
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,979
stop people's first like because like

1310
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,119
kids are broke like like you know the

1311
00:47:20,979 --> 00:47:24,428
valta computer they've got an internet

1312
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,019
access can I have some money no final

1313
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:28,839
ghost comes in for tonight's games you

1314
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:30,519
know like it's I mean it's it's entirely

1315
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:31,900
human nature because it's the path of

1316
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,129
least resistance to making money and

1317
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,009
feeling powerful a lot through the stuff

1318
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:37,539
so we need to stop kids from having

1319
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:39,160
their first exposure and information

1320
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:41,819
security some very very talented kids

1321
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,410
mind gee some of them a few of them and

1322
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:46,140
like we need to stop them stop their

1323
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,960
first

1324
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,609
like interaction with solar first

1325
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,349
interaction with this with this industry

1326
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:58,869
being you know involving the law so yeah

1327
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:00,970
so as this desk talked to a lot of

1328
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:04,960
effort and the few I need to fight for

1329
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,529
it Lloyd is here Rosie wave who cares

1330
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,880
about the bike

1331
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,020
Lloyd help me with a lot of the

1332
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,849
technical details of it because as I

1333
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,770
said I'm not more aware author I'm not a

1334
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:13,599
malware user I don't know anything about

1335
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,940
well I didn't know anything written any

1336
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,680
of this and if you're like him some good

1337
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,900
feeds to follow their malware hunter

1338
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,180
team no I thought that got some help

1339
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,990
from them as well they know a lot about

1340
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,879
they've been here for a while they

1341
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,859
didn't all about historical stuff and of

1342
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,410
course the gold mine that is Brian Krebs

1343
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:32,259
on crabs on security calm he covers a

1344
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,788
lot of the sane and the people here

1345
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:38,200
involved in it so I'll leave you with a

1346
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:39,880
question why do we encourage more kids

1347
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,410
with an interest in this kind of stuff

1348
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,089
into InfoSec rather than blackhat stuff

1349
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,490
which you know ruins our career prospect

1350
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,740
and times their life and our losses all

1351
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,430
so tweeted me and thank you very much

1352

1354
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:12,099

1355
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,650
in Syria no not particularly

1357
