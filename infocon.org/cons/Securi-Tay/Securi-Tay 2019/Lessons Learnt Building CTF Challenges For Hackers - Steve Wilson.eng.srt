6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,730
people coming this right as usual I've

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,919
given myself a stupid task

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,300
I've got 104 slides to get through so

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,820
you will excuse me if I don't breathe

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,260
much and talk very quick

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,699
I always do this it's terrible I'm Steve

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,870
the last slide I delivered somebody

13
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,099
complained that I use horrible fonts you

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,030
can't read so if you want to follow me

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,879
on Twitter it's it's a then pub I'm

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,530
happy to be here I love them I love the

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,419
University I don't love security it's

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,149
brilliant conference I first came to

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,359
here in 2012 I helped review the

20
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,620
syllabus I've spoken at security before

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,929
few years back me encountered someone

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,489
some embedded testing stuff the only

23
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:06,759
time my face has ever appeared in a

24
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:09,039
newspaper was here again I forget which

25
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,670
year that was me posing with somebody

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,380
else's kit no one I'm not here to talk

27
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,549
about confidence as such we do a lot of

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,810
conferences we've you know we teach

29
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:18,610
people lock-picking and all sorts of

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,439
stuff we rock up and bring kit and teach

31
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,179
stuff that's not sort of stuff I'm here

32
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,029
to talk about I'm not here to talk about

33
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:29,170
work I work for large telecoms company

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,189
in Britain we we get involved with a

35
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,750
challenge thing that's around

36
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,329
cybersecurity but again I'm not you know

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,530
we do sort of little games for that I'm

38
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:39,219
here to talk about something on a

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,689
slightly grander scale I'm not really

40
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:42,158
here to talk about hack food but I'm

41
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,258
gonna have to do to kind of explain what

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,950
this is all about who is member of your

43
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:50,740
event it's amazing it's a CTF thing that

44
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,289
runs over a number of days that they're

45
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,939
always awesome yeah I'm lucky enough

46
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,439
that I have friends of a company so so

47
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,359
my friend Mike you it was always crazy

48
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,770
about puzzle has taught me hooked in and

49
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,928
it's great fun I mean there are there

50
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,630
are some amazing people building amazing

51
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:05,649
challenges and the event itself is

52
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,590
stunning I mean again if you go and

53
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,810
Google you know there is stuff out there

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,610
on it I would suggest you make friends

55
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,650
and try and get invited though it's it's

56
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,390
difficult to get into but the way you

57
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,420
get in is you've built

58
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,470
just for them and then you get an invite

59
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,819
so what we hit talk about is there's a

60
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,430
couple of the challenges I made for them

61
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,958
over a couple of years now again I'm not

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,080
you know I have no background in

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,819
building games I you know I've played a

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,560
few and I decided to have a go and

65
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,489
because I like doing physical bits and

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,170
everybody else seems to do more

67
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,390
computery stuff it's that well I said

68
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,649
there's a slot there I can fill but yeah

69
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,760
yeah I'm you know I'm not an expert in

70
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,530
this sort of stuff this is just the

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,720
first couple of attempts I had what I

72
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,370
did how it went and I'm sort of you know

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,010
problems and things occurred along the

74
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:51,180
way so the first one first one was back

75
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,579
in 2015 now at the time I was teaching

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,230
myself how to repin locks refitting

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,670
locks is a useful skill because like you

78
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,510
know say you wanna buy padlocks if you

79
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,980
want to practice on 50 different

80
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,380
padlocks you have to buy you fifty

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,670
padlocks if you let the repin locks you

82
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,870
can buy one lock and and it's an

83
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,708
infinite number of locks you just take

84
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,630
it pop and we do it

85
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,980
so it's a trite I can it's useful skill

86
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,769
not lot of people are doing it I can

87
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,869
build something around that and you know

88
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm somewhat optimistic so it's not

89
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,160
really difficult so how what can it be

90
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,180
you know manual dexterity but but you

91
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,340
know things should be fairly

92
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,989
self-explanatory that this is where it

93
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,220
starts doing wrong like assuming oh I

94
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,480
know how people approach this side I

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,160
know what will happen I know how all

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,268
good and I'll build something that's

97
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,109
that's doable in the time they've got

98
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,489
and then they don't but yeah so the

99
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,140
process I start following sites you know

100
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,250
I start off right there's an event in X

101
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,708
months I need to come up with something

102
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,870
get a notepad out stop scribbling ideas

103
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:44,280
down and that very quickly turns into

104
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,600
lots more random planning and I know the

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,370
idea to come up come up with some sort

106
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,350
of you know it's like like physical

107
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,230
things I can get them doing and some

108
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,400
sort of puzzles around that and then

109
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,470
there's an amount of you know get create

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,079
build kit stab yourself in hands a lot

111
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,430
taking lots of parts which is a meanness

112
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,130
one of the problems with doing this sort

113
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,380
of stuff but some idea for this was

114
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,760
right I know there's gonna be five teams

115
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,049
if I can get like five blocks per team

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,090
that's 25lakhs I have another one in

117
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,709
that's 26 I've got an alphabet I can now

118
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,420
start doing word puzzles around keys and

119
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,220
walks and you know making stuff

120
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,289
interesting the other thing was oh yes

121
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,970
some boxes so it's so I got my friend to

122
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,649
knock me up some quick boxes so they

123
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,630
stack the idea being you know you pick

124
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,580
the lock on box one you can then get

125
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,260
that off to get the box to the box three

126
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,060
plots for box five so again I've got

127
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,300
some progression start with these alts

128
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,069
get

129
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,289
more difficult and there will be things

130
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,680
in the boxes for them to do as they go

131
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:36,719
through I mean let's say the fact I knew

132
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,490
five teams are five multiple people that

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,680
gives me enough to work with I then

134
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,650
stopped writing documentation around it

135
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,750
which is the least fun bit trying to

136
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,060
come up with some sort of plot to

137
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,750
shoehorn in to make some excuse of why

138
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,370
they're doing this

139
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,110
now I'm deliberately not going to show

140
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,490
you much vac because it was dire and the

141
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,129
first time I did it second time they've

142
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,490
got better so you build all this stuff

143
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:02,520
and you go to the event so that fights

144
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,050
me in prison that is I see a former

145
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,750
prison that's never used for the things

146
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,639
that they hired get the kit there and

147
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,469
then I realized that like I've made all

148
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,849
these locks far too difficult so the

149
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:14,370
first night when everybody else is our

150
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,330
part in I'm citing a prison cell taking

151
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,219
lots of heart put them back together

152
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,139
they turned all the lights out in the

153
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:20,810
building so I had a power lead to that

154
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,729
lamp so I'm literally sat in the dark

155
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,289
doing this stuff again it so I never

156
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:29,039
plants the property it always goes wrong

157
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:31,680
don't do that so when they come in the

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,669
room of this first one you know a little

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,159
bit kick you know they've got a desk

160
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,380
lamp and the voice and some of the bits

161
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:41,250
and pieces a sealed envelope and there's

162
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,539
some locked boxes yeah oh yeah and a bit

163
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,460
of paper explaining how this works

164
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,520
because I've got a robbery dollar safe

165
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,719
that they can only do open know each of

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,000
the bits that's underlined all I'll talk

167
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,919
about in more detail so the the sealed

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,479
envelope and again this is this is going

169
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,279
to be the only bit of the friendís plot

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,000
you're gonna see you know it's got some

171
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,279
lock picks

172
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,449
and there's some lock boxes so it's kind

173
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,379
of obvious you need to open the lock

174
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:06,599
boxes where you will find other things

175
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,120
so the first box is a lot more you know

176
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,740
not picking gear and and some

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,300
documentation and again the first time I

178
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,819
did it I printed everything out on paper

179
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,430
so I ended up with with reams and reams

180
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:20,789
and roots so I mean for example this is

181
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,750
my notes from the second one yeah yeah

182
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,310
now you end up with a huge amount

183
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,080
documentation and you need a set for

184
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,629
each team and so you end up killing

185
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,279
those the trees but but they need those

186
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,560
documents to make any sense of what's

187
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,349
going on the second box when they get

188
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,180
into it so I thought what I call yield

189
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,500
repin and challenge so

190
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,840
when I first started taking rocks apart

191
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,789
so the picture on the left is the first

192
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,039
lock I've ever dismantled and I didn't

193
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,080
have the proper tools to do it but I did

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,000
have some matches so I worked out this

195
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,008
really horrendous complicated way of

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,600
using matches to replace the tools I

197
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,490
didn't have and it's it's a stupid idea

198
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,630
it's a stupid way of doing things but it

199
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,820
doesn't work and it's doable

200
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,180
all right I'll mix that chalasis learn

201
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,000
from my mistakes so yes so they complete

202
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,280
that they get a password for later on

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,060
which and again on reflection I should

204
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,619
have done one password

205
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,090
everybody got instead of doing different

206
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,280
ones per team because I just made myself

207
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,469
more work but it's all did my cheat and

208
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,659
collusion which I don't thinks it would

209
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,699
have done but yeah so they start again

210
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,930
it's it's not you know it's just fiddly

211
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,910
doing it on your own as a pin if you've

212
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,169
got a couple of people it's not so bad

213
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,490
[Applause]

214
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:25,719
carrying on the third box actually

215
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,340
starts to have some of the proper kit

216
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,020
for taking lots apart so so Club

217
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,008
followers and whatnot again more

218
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,020
documentation more documentation and say

219
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,430
that the key for the first box which

220
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,080
becomes important because then they

221
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,800
going to need to start measuring keys

222
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,500
and dismantling locks and measuring pins

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,120
now I give them again so it's so trying

224
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,070
to get them thinking along the right

225
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,780
lines without explicitly saying go and

226
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,669
measure these things and do this so it's

227
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,869
alright you've got a lot of them some

228
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,400
documentation rooms you know you've had

229
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,440
this stuff delivered but the paperwork

230
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,239
was damaged these are the serial numbers

231
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,349
but they're broken and again my idea so

232
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,110
that each of the numbers is basically

233
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,860
the depending on the keys so what I want

234
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,849
them to do if I can skip a clicker if

235
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,650
you know they should come up with

236
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,780
something like this and they will need

237
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,330
this later on but again it's trying to

238
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,090
you know without saying dou X dou Y dou

239
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,620
Zed it's like trying to mixing is sort

240
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,359
of obvious okay this is one of the

241
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,099
problems is people never think the same

242
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,759
way I do so you come up with all these

243
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:28,840
silly ideas and they don't work oh they

244
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,639
were you know sometimes carrying on so

245
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,559
obviously we need a measuring stuff so

246
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,940
in the fourth box lesson Bernays they

247
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,250
can actually you know stop doing the

248
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,200
measuring that's also agree to that I

249
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,089
made again to try and get you know the

250
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,680
idea of the minute motion up and then

251
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,200
the final box there's there's a bunch

252
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,760
more bits pieces so the black grid I

253
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,930
give them on the left and again the idea

254
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,310
is they'll come up with something like

255
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,680
the right now they don't actually need

256
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,029
the precise measurements it's just

257
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,180
understanding that you know there are

258
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,140
different sub graduations the keys and

259
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,069
they're getting lead up to the ordering

260
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,390
later on there's a safe and again this

261
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,370
is so this is funny modify used to work

262
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,810
the mo D like lots of buildings we

263
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,310
worked in with with the secure save

264
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,930
things like you don't memorize the

265
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,890
combination to say if you learn the

266
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,390
password and then there's a great

267
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,490
printed and you look up the word and

268
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,660
that PT the combination which I thought

269
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,350
well that's a nice simple puzzle I can

270
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,420
do so so they get this thing amongst the

271
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,920
the paperwork they get saying oh yeah

272
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,819
you need to print out this grid you know

273
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,229
there's some stuff about it's been

274
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,200
running for twelve months I've got lists

275
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,570
words so I give them a list of words all

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,670
these thousand of them of which twelve

277
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,500
of a crossed out so again the hope is

278
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,760
that they lock it in see own that's like

279
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,870
a word with a crossed out wouldn't be

280
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,330
crossed out with the see cross that

281
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,970
would so presumably like the next word

282
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,170
of the sequences could begin with an end

283
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,290
so they can they can go back their grid

284
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,420
and you know if probably starts with an

285
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,980
M so it's probably a zero now the other

286
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,349
thing is they know it's an incorrect

287
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,320
word the combination is a series of

288
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,720
three numbers not 99 so the other thing

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,020
we could probably think is well we've

290
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,380
probably got a couple of you know

291
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,449
characters between

292
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,110
the numbers so you can probably guess

293
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,070
them as well so you know you can start

294
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,209
the thing right we've got a list of

295
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,890
forty thousand words it's probably a

296
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:11,640
word that begins with M it's probably

297
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,540
either M s P your MPs so you could start

298
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,220
going through the words of trying to

299
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,870
find stuff or you know you'd find like a

300
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,730
crossword solver online and you know

301
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,860
what words could it be now the other

302
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,860
thing I gave them so they had to 12

303
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,779
previous number grids torn up into

304
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,490
little pieces so they have to put them

305
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,100
back together and then think write

306
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,370
passwords we know which ones fit which

307
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,420
and if you start looking for this

308
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,220
there's a bit of a pattern starts to

309
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,599
emerge that the gag being of course I

310
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,880
can't change the combination on the same

311
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,400
it's fixed all I can do is change the

312
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,260
word so again you go back to original

313
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,079
thing and then while you feed those

314
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,880
numbers in and sure enough you got

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
eventually when the animation works so

316
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,770
the passwords mistyped which is why I

317
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,680
had the subtle clues but nobody picks up

318
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,880
on us and again you know you spend all

319
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,519
these time come up with a clever little

320
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,199
things that nobody ever notices

321
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,399
so they're getting the safe and again

322
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:08,180
there's a bunch more bits and pieces

323
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,620
that they're gonna need when the second

324
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,859
points token I've skipped over one I

325
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,529
gave him the first one so but yeah and

326
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,930
more challenges so the next one is so

327
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,459
they were given a password so that PTT

328
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,989
my different password and they basically

329
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,089
need to dismantle the five locks they've

330
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,160
got from the five boxes and repin them

331
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:27,459
so that the keys that relate to the

332
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,139
words that were given will open them

333
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,939
which again is not you know it doesn't

334
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,500
take you to member time but but again it

335
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,880
was trying to how do I get them to think

336
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,740
and realize that's what they've got to

337
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,290
do and again writing the plot around it

338
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,670
which was a bit troublesome when they

339
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,620
complete that they get given the puzzle

340
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,300
box on the left which I was getting

341
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,829
opened and then they get from that the

342
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,069
puzzle box on the right which gives them

343
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:51,019
a key for the final box it's locked

344
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:52,099
and again this was a bit clunky in that

345
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,329
you know I need to make sure and watch

346
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,290
what's going on because you know a lot

347
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,519
of the challenges there helped a lot

348
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,870
computer-based well it's all automated

349
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,000
you know you just want to do stuff in it

350
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,670
it works whereas this stuff I have to

351
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,630
stand and watch them all do it not only

352
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,979
because I'm concerned they can break

353
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,750
stuff and a lot of this like when you've

354
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,940
got one of the things and if they mess

355
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,870
it up it's gonna ruin it for everyone

356
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,360
but again it's you know it's a lot more

357
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,160
time-consuming sort of monitor than some

358
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,389
of the other challenges they have which

359
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,310
is a problem for me because it means it

360
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,480
verily I miss most of the event because

361
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,630
I'm stood watching people go through my

362
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,769
challenge but yes and I'd say that the

363
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,519
key they get out the puzzle box will

364
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:27,560
open in another fire safe in which there

365
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,899
is the final challenge which talks about

366
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,209
master keys so the idea with master keys

367
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,730
is rather than just having two pins in a

368
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,510
lock you have three or four or five so

369
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,819
if you doing it like if you're in a

370
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,189
shared buildings you know that might be

371
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,689
like a you know like a management key

372
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,769
they'll open all the doors and then you

373
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,240
might have keys will only work for

374
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,639
certain floors or ever so the idea is

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,569
you can you know configure locks so they

376
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,189
can be opened with multiple different

377
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,839
keys and I mean if it's and less secure

378
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:53,149
because you have more points which the

379
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,740
local turn but yeah but yeah there is I

380
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,959
want them to try and come up with like

381
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,389
right given this thing how and we know

382
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,939
the keys can we make a lock that will be

383
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:03,829
opened by multiple keys and how many and

384
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,269
my best solution ought to come up with

385
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,920
three that's a way of doing it sequence

386
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,230
you know you can have one locks that

387
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,279
will be opened by three different Peas

388
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,350
but I said the general thing if they can

389
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:16,280
get this a 2 2 2 is a pass

390
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,290
that'd be good enough but yes and so the

391
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,990
basics of the entire totally the

392
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,939
challenge is you know pick five blocks

393
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,170
together the lot that's in bits measure

394
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,930
a bunch of stuff to work out the coding

395
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,420
that's in use open the safe

396
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,739
by working at the password thing repin

397
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,810
the five blocks so they match the

398
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,870
password you were given open the puzzle

399
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,359
boxes and then redo the final thing so

400
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,380
that simple writers but the trouble is

401
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,030
it isn't you know something to do that

402
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,530
you can been very mind they've got but

403
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,959
like four hours to do this I think it

404
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,300
was four hours per game I mean even if

405
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,410
you know what you're doing it it takes a

406
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,520
while we get through it and the trouble

407
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,829
is of course people don't realize what

408
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,410
they're doing so anyway you know no plan

409
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,170
survives first contact with the enemy

410
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,790
sobs I have an honest people taking part

411
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,370
anyway you know it went reasonably well

412
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,689
oh I also need to mention that the one

413
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,280
person who I haven't secured the

414
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,320
photograph because he said I could talk

415
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,339
about him it's my friend Terry I did

416
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
promise I would only say nice things

417
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,940
which I will

418
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,590
Terry's amazing so it's a most the team

419
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,730
sent you know a number of people sell

420
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,020
Gary's that's lot Chung's it's going on

421
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,730
what's then you've got certain time for

422
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,050
him to do certain ones and everybody

423
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,540
else you know three or four people would

424
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,810
turn up when it was Terry Terry's team's

425
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,910
go Terry turns up on his own which is

426
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,489
fine but there's you know there's lots

427
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,199
of stuff to get on with but he got to a

428
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,690
point whence the the time the hill

429
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,730
locked back together and I was convinced

430
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,740
he'd broken it like it's like you we

431
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,840
 it up plus that's not fixable we

432
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,150
haven't got and he spent about 45

433
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,230
minutes and he fixed it which I will

434
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,150
give him all the credit in the world for

435
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,710
because I was convinced that he'd ruined

436
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,120
it for everyone

437
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,860
he also builds like a lot of challenges

438
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,280
he just like amazing work you'll see him

439
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,110
a lot of you know other events the MWR

440
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,420
up with all sorts of crazy so yeah an

441
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,260
amazing one with all logic kids and I've

442
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,819
been again you know there's a lot of

443
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,950
team effort goes into it but let's see

444
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,630
attack terrorism no I got a lot time to

445
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,490
Terry and he always says nice things

446
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,700
about me so I figure I'm you know I can

447
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,550
return the favor but yeah so that was

448
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,890
four points which isn't a lot the fight

449
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,140
teams took part most of them got two

450
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,640
points the final team who I might have

451
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,400
given a few more hints because I wanted

452
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,319
somebody to finish it I got three but

453
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,240
but nobody did the last bit it was you

454
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,080
know it just wasn't doable in the time

455
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,940
that they had so again it was open

456
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,650
poor design on my pot but you know I'd

457
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,780
never built one of these before now I'm

458
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,920
horribly self-critical so cause I sit

459
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,660
and like it it's just rubbish it's

460
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
terrible it's a disaster so you know

461
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,469
it's too complicated it's there's too

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,730
much going on it's also it's it's too

463
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,800
linear it's like you know you do this

464
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,960
then nothin nothin nothin nothin that's

465
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,040
all there is there wasn't you know I

466
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,030
didn't have like the huge amount of

467
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,990
technologies in there there was other

468
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,910
stuff I could deal with the plot was

469
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,040
awful and there really there are no

470
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,810
points soon all right so I bear that in

471
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,260
mind next time I go to build something

472
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:58,670
so this one was better I think I hope

473
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:02,880
it's a number - 2016

474
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:04,380
now again so they have like things like

475
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,450
advertising before the events where the

476
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,350
bits going on and it seemed that they

477
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,360
were gonna have like a post-apocalyptic

478
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,820
theme which is why in the write-up I

479
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,080
mention the wasteland scene I'm gonna

480
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,610
try and get some technologies a tree and

481
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,990
more more different types of technology

482
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,460
hopefully stuff they've not seen I've

483
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,320
got to try and train them in how that

484
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,060
stuff works and then have them do

485
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,710
something with it so it's more

486
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,439
educational I can get more out of it and

487
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,790
just oh we know how to do this already

488
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,270
now I'm obsessed with video games

489
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,530
I love post-apocalyptic stuff so that

490
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,850
you know I'm stopped thinking in my mind

491
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,880
so we're going through a fallout world

492
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,720
and fall actually not further than that

493
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,360
nobody's gonna get this reference I

494
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,980
would assume so so in the 1980s there

495
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,250
was a game called wasteland which was

496
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,240
amazing so again it's it's raw I need to

497
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,010
come up with stuff so again get the

498
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,270
notebooks out now I go back over the

499
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,680
notes from the game I did before and

500
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,300
find all the things that like I could do

501
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,500
something with playing cards or coins or

502
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,599
all the stuff I didn't have time to

503
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,290
implement so I would feed that in and

504
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,510
new things and again I you know I liked

505
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,310
recycling so I'm going to use the same

506
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,990
stuff again if I can so I've got the

507
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,730
same lockboxes

508
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,319
stack a lot boxes I had before I've

509
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,709
still got the fire safe and I've still

510
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,899
got the fire box but I also go buy some

511
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,880
additional bits so I like good having a

512
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,290
local army surplus store buy some ammo

513
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,490
crates because this is gonna have a

514
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,010
military theme when you only want to get

515
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,839
military stuff in here if I can I'd like

516
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,640
to say the idea is I have the lock boxes

517
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,810
which will teach them stuff and then the

518
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,060
things that they're taught from that

519
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:32,310
they go and use against the other things

520
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:34,080
to actually you know get stuff so this

521
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,450
time in a previously was pin tumblers

522
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,949
and repainting locks this time okay

523
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,220
we've still got pin tumblers repin in

524
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,200
but I'm also talking

525
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,940
with lots to be locks handcuffs padlock

526
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,630
sermons and lever locks decided to get

527
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,490
rid of the paper

528
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,530
having perving paper as a stupid idea I

529
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,309
can't keep printing there hundreds and

530
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,678
hundreds of sheets

531
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:56,020
it just becomes unmanageable so I'm

532
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,950
gonna get USB sticks USB sticks are

533
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,510
awesome because it means I can stop

534
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,730
doing stuff like encrypted documents I

535
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,780
can get from video files to my cats and

536
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,059
you know stuff that I couldn't do with

537
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,928
paper but I did end up generating a

538
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:10,210
rather large amount of stuff the other

539
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,789
thing I got better at is like notes

540
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,530
myself how does this work what's because

541
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:16,330
the other thing is I would like the

542
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,039
capital point where I can not have to

543
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,580
stand watching it all going on or get

544
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,799
some help

545
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,120
so again happy notes like what goes

546
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,500
where how does it work what are the

547
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,209
clues they need what solution bits they

548
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,960
need so again I you know my

549
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,890
documentation is getting better I hope

550
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,059
although again it's funny of you if you

551
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,620
go through the pile of stuff like the

552
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,000
first challenges are really well written

553
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,309
up and then as you get further on

554
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,720
there's less and less and a lot of it's

555
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,428
got bits scribbled in pen where I you

556
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,620
know realized on the event is I'm

557
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,909
setting up that stuff doesn't work but

558
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,590
again I'll walk you through so what goes

559
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:46,480
on so the first thing is tubular locks

560
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,889
and again always thinking so I don't

561
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,030
know whether people will recognize again

562
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,370
if there's haven't fallen fans

563
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,049
Brotherhood of Steel logo they've

564
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,739
crossed go and find old technology and

565
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,570
do stuff with it

566
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,059
so I have scavenger reports where

567
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,470
they've gotten phone stuff so for

568
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,590
example you know let's say some stuff on

569
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,140
Cuban locks I think I have obscured so

570
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,789
the there were GPS coordinates the kind

571
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,750
of point in my house obviously that's

572
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,090
where they would have found this stuff

573
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,549
and so I've taken those notes you can't

574
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,928
find out where I live but yes like I

575
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,610
said so there's that and then I have

576
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,350
research reports based on these

577
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,539
scavenger reports which explain in more

578
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,010
detail but what these things are how

579
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,720
they work and what you're supposed to do

580
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,039
so again I'm trying to I want to teach

581
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,140
people stuff like if you don't seen this

582
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,520
stuff before here is some stuff that I

583
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,090
wouldn't explains the gaming bits also

584
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,559
the technology behind it one one funny

585
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,090
thing so one of the things to do with

586
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,309
the tubing locks was you needed to

587
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,570
measure the cuts on keys so for that

588
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,100
you'd use like a motion thief

589
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,418
well I'm not just gonna give them that

590
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,389
so I tipped it to the bottom one of the

591
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,710
boxes nobody found it oh yeah

592
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,669
and again it's another one of those

593
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,929
things that were yeah I'll be dead

594
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,760
obvious they'll be looking first and

595
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:50,650
nobody did

596
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,879
even though there was what a clue in one

597
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,170
of the things saying the Peden has been

598
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,520
hidden somewhere else I see nobody

599
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,220
actually found on the day no I'm gonna

600
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,830
skip over I was gonna put the videos on

601
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,570
but I don't think I'm gonna have time

602
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,919
cuz I've got a lot to get through the

603
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,030
videos I used in my talk at besides

604
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,200
Manchester last year so if you're

605
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,110
particularly interested your web start

606
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,120
quick limit myself but yeah so basically

607
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,439
they need to get in that box first box

608
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,959
and in that box

609
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,580
I must standing on that chair in that

610
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,640
box there's a bunch of stuff a lot of

611
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,710
stuff again you might recognise if you

612
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,929
see him pick going back there but their

613
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,390
stuff on unlike impression in their

614
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:28,990
stuff on bump keys that there's a UV

615
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,179
torch and a load of uranium glass I had

616
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,710
a box with a lot of really active tape

617
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,549
all over it and glow sticks in so it was

618
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,070
all blue in there is a disc in there if

619
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:41,160
anybody remembers that little technology

620
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,320
on which there is a huge amount of stuff

621
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,880
and again so lots of stuff from and

622
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,549
again in my Manchester besides talk I

623
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,250
talk about Titleist that house style.the

624
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,450
town even allem and then just wires and

625
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,919
again there's you know videos of there's

626
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,150
documents there's there's a huge amount

627
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,470
of stuff on it that there is more stuff

628
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,790
on this this done you could watching the

629
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,429
time but the challenge is going to run

630
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,290
for the other thing is the horribly

631
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,059
broken locked in so if you look at the

632
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,710
title of the disc it's it's temporary

633
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,629
resident which is some online translate

634
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,400
thing when I said what's Latin for time

635
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,650
sync that's what it gave me

636
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,910
so if commit so it's all a red herring

637
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,809
none of this is anything to do with the

638
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,150
challenge you're not going to get any

639
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,700
points from any of this I wanted to be a

640
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,410
bit nasty to be fair like if anybody

641
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,820
spent more about 10 minutes like I said

642
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,280
leave that alone and guns

643
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,120
come and look at the other stuff I mean

644
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,970
the other thing that might give a little

645
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,040
clue so inside the lock box this is a

646
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,030
certain face although I was kind of nice

647
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,250
because if you're showing that you'd be

648
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,360
thing of it it says use the UV torch so

649
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,730
the only thing that boxer was any good

650
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,290
was UV torch again I love I love right

651
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,820
and stopping you being it's brilliant

652
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,230
for this sort of thing because you know

653
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,450
it's invisible until you look although

654
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,340
well so like you know like the ammo

655
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,650
cases and stuff awesome you can't see it

656
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,059
but some of the other plastic things you

657
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,799
write on it's like you can see yeah it's

658
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,250
visible so again it's working out where

659
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,970
does this work where doesn't it right

660
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,740
next one

661
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,990
so we've done Juba locks and then we've

662
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,120
got handcuffs again because everybody

663
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,830
likes clean with handcuffs

664
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,659
you do these things at conferences and

665
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,710
the handcuffs the one everyone liked now

666
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,380
the trouble is and again this is another

667
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,870
example of planning doing wrong I have

668
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,730
known 44 cons wrists USB stick things

669
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,620
and because of what's on the next slide

670
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,330
I wanted to use it which was awesome

671
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,520
until two days before the event when it

672
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,439
stopped working or became intermittent

673
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,180
so it's alright okay put it on another

674
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,620
USB stick and make a note in the

675
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,240
documentation they get seen here sorry

676
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,689
about this this nope doesn't make any

677
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,610
sense

678
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,960
but again it's you know I mean the other

679
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,459
thing like moving forward I'm gonna have

680
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,140
multiple copies of everything when I do

681
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,070
this because again I'd rather mean have

682
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,560
it not mean he dip in the other way

683
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,929
around on the USB stick again on

684
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,030
recycling old material is why not so I

685
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,450
did a I did a stuff first type of 44 con

686
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,620
on on handcuffs and paperclip pickings

687
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,380
so it's alright they can help have the

688
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,959
slides to read through again video on it

689
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll skip over and then the thing they

690
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,800
have to open a couple of ammo cases and

691
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,820
you can just say that we've put some

692
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,649
loops on them in there handcuffed

693
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,720
together so to open the boxes you need

694
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,130
to take the handcuffs off one of them is

695
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,410
single locked one is double locked so

696
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,730
again you have easier one the harder one

697
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,010
and when you look in the boxes well

698
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,890
what's the first one there's a couple of

699
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,660
bags full of bits of stuff which is

700
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,310
pistol magazines disassembled there's a

701
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,650
knife him as a holster and some

702
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,700
raspberry at filters and and a skull and

703
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,540
crossbones flags

704
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,790
why not box number two with the nice

705
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,780
picture of a pistol on it

706
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:27,120
and be very again says well you'll see

707
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,590
when an episode comes up I put a drive

708
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,600
these things up and over the country to

709
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,709
the event so I don't really want people

710
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,770
play the pictures of these on the

711
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,180
internet so yeah so in box number two

712
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,010
there are a couple of pistols in pieces

713
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:44,100
now obviously from a legal point these

714
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,200
are not real guns those to a point for

715
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,429
us however the police don't know that

716
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,590
and if you're in a public place with

717
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,970
them you're probably gonna get shot so

718
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,800
so again just a note for all the

719
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,940
attendees say but please don't don't

720
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,980
mess around with you so I'm going to be

721
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,740
further up like an old military base so

722
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,120
there's you know they're all legitimate

723
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,360
weaponry around but again I'm finally

724
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,080
really responsible and for once which is

725
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
unusual for me

726
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,950
so yeah next one is padlock shims so

727
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,330
again you know we have small Oh

728
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,870
scavenger reports we found these bits

729
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,970
pieces we found these nerds I'd taken a

730
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,260
bin with meters as a prop which I'd

731
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,490
washed out a load of old coke cans

732
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,190
because you know you take your Co

733
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,390
transit connections at them and I put it

734
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,220
under the table with all the other stuff

735
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,200
and flow today people keep throwing

736
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,880
rubbish in it it's not know it's part

737
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,830
the challenges will you stop messing my

738
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,390
bin up which was the innocence you know

739
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,409
say you want the clean cans don't be

740
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,600
cutting up the ones that still follow

741
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,799
coke and again you know more

742
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,750
documentation explaining how these

743
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,520
shrooms work and again videos which I'll

744
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,990
skip over but the thing they have to get

745
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,760
you this time was a slightly larger I'm

746
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,840
okay stand you can see we stuck some

747
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,520
things on the ends there's a couple of

748
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,350
really bad padlocks that you can shove

749
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,129
up and even with shims made up with all

750
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:01,340
the coke cans and they decide that there

751
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,100
is some a couple of magazines for some

752
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,870
sort of assault rifle similar you know

753
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,230
the actual respirator that the filters

754
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,280
were in the box before was mortification

755
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,100
tablets it's not thing that might be

756
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,970
useful in a post-apocalyptic setting

757
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,370
there's also a bunch of clothing so

758
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,260
comforting a balaclava and gloves and a

759
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,209
USB stick with a little more stuff on it

760
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,470
and on the USB stick on more detailed

761
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,210
instructions for the things they've had

762
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,470
in bits in the previous bags so they

763
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,780
don't might actually have some idea on

764
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,100
how to put them together again which

765
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,629
obviously is part of challenges there's

766
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,610
also some some stuff on things they

767
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,340
haven't found yet and with some slightly

768
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,699
larger weaponry and ultimately there is

769
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:40,280
a text file called orders now looking at

770
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,120
that well let the pistols because we've

771
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,770
got instructions to put them back

772
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,659
together and the respirators not exactly

773
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,429
rocket science so they can do that but

774
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,220
I've see the rebuilding the rifles what

775
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,750
rifles and accessing the safe well how

776
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:58,220
do we do that there's nothing to tell us

777
00:25:50,750 --> 00:26:01,010
thus far but yeah you know again I like

778
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,690
you be think so so the next bit level

779
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,280
four that they're going to open a box

780
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,330
and find there's a bunch of encrypted

781
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,918
stuff in there wouldn't they don't know

782
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,020
what the password is but it's written on

783
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,429
the box if you were looking and we get

784
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,870
everybody eventually when they picked up

785
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,780
the UV torch is like everything they

786
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,159
find is going over the UV torch okay I

787
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,300
had all sorts of ideas for like I'm

788
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,510
going to put lots of you know false

789
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,030
leads and but again

790
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,100
I left myself so short on time which is

791
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,570
another thing I do all the time like

792
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,610
writing this slide deck for today which

793
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,120
I finished a few minutes before I

794
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,889
started but yes lockboxes is leave a lot

795
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,510
so again it explains you know here's a

796
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:38,270
bunch of stuff when I have leave a

797
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:40,590
lock-picking works and examples and yeah

798
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,510
the encrypted documents so encrypted

799
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,000
with that password that's on the box one

800
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,679
of them talks about removing tip and oh

801
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,059
sorry I'll skip over the video oh the

802
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,160
other thing which I'll put my hands up

803
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,809
to I never wrote the Skype into report

804
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,610
for this bit which again is another

805
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,530
example of me having these grand ideas

806
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,629
and not really having time to do it

807
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,510
properly which is a thing we do all the

808
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,710
time so I'll put me under but ultimately

809
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,559
the box they've trying to get into is

810
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,150
this even bigger I'm okay I wonder

811
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,790
what's in that and the padlock which is

812
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,760
on there it's wrapped in tip because

813
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,168
it's a cut away and the hints encrypted

814
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,540
says you can take the tip off if you

815
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:17,280
want but it's funny because I only half

816
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,480
the team's did now whether that's

817
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,040
because they'd actually read the thing

818
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,600
we thought or we can it says we can take

819
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,830
the tip off or whether they're just the

820
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,418
sort of people look like but but that

821
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,980
tip will come off we can we don't mean

822
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,450
that there it'll say it was interesting

823
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,549
the way of different people approached

824
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,290
us obviously taking the tape off makes

825
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:33,299
it a lot easier but but I say several

826
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:38,190
teams opened it without and then in that

827
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:40,559
box right here are more guns so the

828
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,929
order said you but assemble them but but

829
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,580
they're already assembled so that

830
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,610
doesn't make a lot of sense unless you

831
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,559
find the UV message on the inside of the

832
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,409
ammo case saying that the code to open

833
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,830
the safe is hidden in the guns alright

834
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,540
so we need to take bits again these are

835
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,790
these are not real firearms these are

836
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,730
dummy training things designed to be

837
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,500
strippable it's an interesting legal

838
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,020
saying that the law has changed since I

839
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,340
bought these you can't buy these anymore

840
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,590
but I was surprised I'm lucky to keep

841
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,470
them just don't run around in public

842
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,570
with them now it's ok they need to get

843
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,490
the safe and we all know we can all

844
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,649
remember what's the password for the

845
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,720
safe well it's mistyped isn't it because

846
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,370
I can't change it and I why would I

847
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,660
bother resetting and nobody remembered

848
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,159
like the Aleut least some of the same

849
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,000
people did the thing from last year and

850
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,530
it all forgotten what the

851
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
you know the password had been to nobody

852
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,080
nobody did any shortcuts all got around

853
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,729
it that takes mental thing which again I

854
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,740
basically just taken that repinning

855
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,940
thing that nobody did the last time and

856
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,680
it's like no no somebody's gonna finish

857
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,450
this I'm just gonna keep running this is

858
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,390
a challenge every year until somebody

859
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,490
gets it so again we have scavenger

860
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,160
reports explaining how that's worked Oh

861
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,540
in the sea if there is another another

862
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,730
challenge which I don't put a second

863
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,440
again this one I've been nice and I've

864
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,610
taken the emails I had before and I've

865
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,510
actually filled them in for them so they

866
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,399
don't have to bother doing all the

867
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,550
measuring and stuff they just have to

868
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,410
think about it there was also a mailbox

869
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,690
and again there's a little image up

870
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,570
there that this is you know this blobs -

871
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:14,350
inmate 2 3 4 93 oh and if you look at

872
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,790
the if you look at the I've not obscure

873
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,830
that one because that doesn't point at

874
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,450
my house that's the place where we had

875
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:22,210
the thing in the previous year so again

876
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,230
like little Easter eggs for so you know

877
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,660
you might be asking who's hidden it

878
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,570
whatever that number is well that would

879
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,930
be me when I was in prison don't I look

880
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,700
happy

881
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,710
given I've just turned up at event and

882
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,290
being locked up in prison oh and I need

883
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,490
to sneakily get snoop Conan's as I knew

884
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,320
ponds our internal conference we'd run

885
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,170
every year so you don't see me wandering

886
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,730
around with snoop on everything but yeah

887
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,490
yeah so I say it's just another nod back

888
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,790
to the previous events now even in that

889
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:51,190
mill box you know some some weird

890
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:53,080
strange Masonic looking the stickers and

891
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,540
the key to answers which again if you

892
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,800
look at the UV thin so there was a

893
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,899
another thing that was encrypted and I

894
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,450
told them how to work out what lucky is

895
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,210
but in case they couldn't be bothered I

896
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,410
tried it later on although again I think

897
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,450
a lot of people didn't realize the

898
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,650
didn't week but that decrypted something

899
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,990
they'd seen previously and hadn't gotten

900
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,320
to I mean again it's you know I'm making

901
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,460
things openly complex but yeah and then

902
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,530
that the final bit that was in the safe

903
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,450
so I have an old locket of a safety

904
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,340
deposit box so it's an 11 leave a lock

905
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,850
and it's beautiful it's it's you know

906
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,290
it's it's built amazingly well and what

907
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,490
happens is you know you take this thing

908
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,899
you show it to people and you take the

909
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,340
cover off now that's pretty and

910
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,200
everybody turns it upside down and all

911
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,250
the bits drop out so I just give her the

912
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,660
bits and like there you go put that back

913
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,350
together because I've had to do it in

914
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,450
hundreds of times feel my pins and again

915
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,570
I'm nice I give them like pictures and

916
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,390
stuff so they can work

917
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,460
going on and again it's not it's not

918
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,380
really complicated stuff fiddly you know

919
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,120
it's not that's not no rocket science

920
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,290
involved now you know you've got a bunch

921
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,699
of things that will only sit in one of

922
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,740
the five or six positions and it's just

923
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,740
stacking them in the right order and

924
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,150
making sure it works and so that was the

925
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,640
final bit of the you know the actual of

926
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,710
what they need to do so again I had a

927
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,690
world phone getting it there bearing in

928
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,820
mind I've got to drive half the country

929
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,410
with a load of things that the police

930
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,550
wouldn't like me having I mean fortune

931
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,790
they're all in boxes all about still

932
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,950
locked on electron transport them safely

933
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,899
but yeah yeah we got there once again i

934
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,850
sat up half the night tweaking things

935
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,350
but because I forgot to take some of the

936
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,209
USB stick so I have to recreate a punch

937
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,370
of the contents from scratch whoops

938
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,840
and again it's I always do this no

939
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,510
you know what one day I will have it all

940
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,149
prepped and ready and ready to go but

941
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,860
just not the two I've done yet and again

942
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,060
so you can get some idea of the you know

943
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,320
the size the setup again it's you know

944
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,000
I've got a little table we've got the

945
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,350
safe on top list of mil box

946
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,660
there's the ammo crates hiding at the

947
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:45,679
back there's a bin with hands in it and

948
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,940
we've got people taking part I quite

949
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,140
like this picture because you can see

950
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,760
there's obviously a lot of different

951
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,410
things going on so where's the other one

952
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,550
was like horribly linear this one at

953
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,140
least people were sort of spinning there

954
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,310
and attacking different you've got one

955
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,990
person just opening the boxes and

956
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,820
handing the clues over then Megan so

957
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,340
again it was sort of more team-oriented

958
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,810
which I thought went quite well and

959
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,120
again you know a bunch of anonymous

960
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:07,010
people picking Rob's point pistols back

961
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,169
together again that the guns went there

962
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,360
really well everybody seemed like hey

963
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,950
guns clear guns

964
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,310
not that I'm sayin unless the Packers

965
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,980
like weaponry or anything but you know

966
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,149
the the theme fit with the wider plot

967
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,380
was going on and I mean again if you're

968
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,440
on Google there is a like a three or

969
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,800
four minute video trailer thing about

970
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,840
the event which which I buy a pair for

971
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,030
embarrass half a second as you see me

972
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,510
diving out of the camera shot him as

973
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:36,560
they pan past my kid I mean again you

974
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,330
know people working as a team

975
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,669
collaborating inside work quite nicely

976
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,929
and this time I know four points for the

977
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,690
first challenge this time I had seven

978
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,980
and all of them some people cuz you've

979
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,740
got quite a nice bell curve in a couple

980
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,760
of them one team got several of the most

981
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,080
of the team's cotton and there's a

982
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,629
couple that like one team

983
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,610
didn't and again I think the trouble

984
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,870
lost the team that didn't really pistols

985
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,719
it's because they were trying to get all

986
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,489
the pin tumblers picked and they didn't

987
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,510
get it done in time

988
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:07,220
no I got some amazing feedback it was

989
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,980
yeah it was I think a lot better

990
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,690
received in the first one again because

991
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,040
I say I've got you know there is stuff

992
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,290
they've not seen so I'm teaching you how

993
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,639
it works and I'm making you actually you

994
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,730
know practically use those skills for

995
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,420
something have I only really done class

996
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:26,030
now because I'm getting the end of this

997
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:29,780
that's that doesn't make sense

998
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:32,120
um so yeah I've got the summary quick

999
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,410
and I thought I pro tip don't leave

1000
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,179
lasting right in your slides the last

1001
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:40,700
minute no you know it is a lot of fun

1002
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,650
doing the sort of stuff but it's

1003
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,000
expensive its time-consuming it's

1004
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,160
frustrating it's annoying it's

1005
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
infuriating but ultimately rewarding you

1006
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,990
know it was it was a huge amount of fun

1007
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,790
watching people I mean yeah the first

1008
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,130
one not so much the second one was a lot

1009
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:59,600
more fun I am currently thinking about

1010
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:01,790
version 3 I have some ideas we've we've

1011
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,419
got some bits for work that I can

1012
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:07,430
probably repurpose I have some sneaky

1013
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,560
ideas for again more more red herrings

1014
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,050
more more you know things to waste their

1015
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,580
time more things to put them off I'm now

1016
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,540
looking I mean I keep saying next time

1017
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,860
I'm just gonna build something that's a

1018
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,029
roughly pie that you just push one

1019
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,810
button and it's ready to go and I don't

1020
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,450
have to sit all night

1021
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:24,070
oh I suspect I won't I suspect I will

1022
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:26,178
end up with all this stuff and more bits

1023
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,380
and yeah let's say I've been playing

1024
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,720
around electronics I'll be building

1025
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,610
rusty pies on doing as that stuff we did

1026
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,319
some stuff at InfoSec last year you know

1027
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,970
simple time isn't like that went down

1028
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,740
quite well so I'm hoping to get some

1029
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,689
writing I'm hoping to try and like

1030
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,259
recruit some help could I say trying to

1031
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,950
run these things on your own is yeah

1032
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,300
it's hard work I say put both in terms

1033
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,600
of you know the amount of time it takes

1034
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,270
to plan and plot and buy and design and

1035
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,630
document I mean again I dread to think

1036
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,580
how much effort I certainly the second

1037
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,520
one you know the second one was it is

1038
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,860
stupid remember work and again you know

1039
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,430
I've had hard random ideas once again

1040
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,839
it's like

1041
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,690
I'll come up with all these ideas and

1042
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,549
then actually implement it is the the

1043
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,859
bit but I struggle with again you know

1044
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:14,960
through my own competences and on a

1045
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:16,339
sudden I've got the pub instead there'll

1046
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,710
be plenty of time later which there ever

1047
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:19,759
is but yes like I said you know do it

1048
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,559
doing it as a team thing would probably

1049
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,789
probably be better but but you know I

1050
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,140
say if you have the opportunity I would

1051
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,029
you know building these things is fun

1052
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,680
you have taken part it's fun but but I

1053
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:31,039
say building them as well is it a

1054
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,229
different salt rewarding I would suggest

1055
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,599
you all do it and get involved in events

1056
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:37,609
like this I mean again you know it's a

1057
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,069
wider point you know the amount I have

1058
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:41,979
learnt by attending those events because

1059
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:44,420
you have such clever people around you

1060
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:46,759
with you know such interesting ideas and

1061
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,369
I'm trying to make you think which again

1062
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:50,890
is can be difficult but like I say I

1063
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,910
would I would definitely get involved

1064
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:57,410
and I've just done a hundred of three

1065
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:58,600
slides in 35 minutes I'm really sorry I

1066
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,729
thought I was going to run at the time

1067
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:09,049
[Music]

1068
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:10,339
does anybody have any questions so sorry

1069
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll repeat the question because I

1070
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:13,400
didn't the last time I did this for the

1071
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,920
for the point in my phone have I ever

1072
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,460
thought about escape rooms so I've done

1073
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,529
one wants in Edinburgh funnily enough

1074
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,019
which again was it was great fun and

1075
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:26,599
this sort of stuff I guess you could

1076
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:27,439
could redeploy it that sort of thing and

1077
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,420
I should look for more

1078
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,219
I'd say it's it's a we had we had a

1079
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,380
brilliant time in Edinburgh even even

1080
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:36,289
though we yeah they have to give us some

1081
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,640
significant help the other thing is cost

1082
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,019
they don't like it when you turn up and

1083
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,479
they've got something involving locks no

1084
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:46,339
just open picks up oh no but yeah yeah I

1085
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:48,759
mean this is like this is like a 3d

1086
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:51,440
escape room effectively these events not

1087
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:53,329
as if I said it's brilliant fun

1088
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,769
I definitely yeah I need to find I

1089
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:57,140
should set up a local escape room there

1090
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:59,348
must be it must be trying upon and

1091
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,578
listen where I live where I live

1092
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,039
are you can Google become not hard to

1093
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:09,519
find in fact Twitter says where I live

1094
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,519
there you go any anyone else come

1095
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:18,499
[Music]

1096
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,949
no this is one of the problems I wish I

1097
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:21,799
did

1098
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:22,999
that's the store one I'm awesome at

1099
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:25,729
coming up with ideas and I'm terrible

1100
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,660
implementation because again it's oh no

1101
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:28,038
they'll be talking about will be time

1102
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,479
for I'll make up and then invariably at

1103
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,699
all I mean I say it's like writing it

1104
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:32,890
off for day I should have written this

1105
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:35,869
months ago when it was accepted I

1106
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,118
shouldn't have left it till you know the

1107
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:40,039
last minute but I always do it is and

1108
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,319
I'm trying not to but again you know my

1109
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,449
planning my admin is getting better so

1110
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:45,739
hopefully I can I can carry forward I

1111
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:47,420
mean the other thing is like I say I you

1112
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,920
know it's like keeping ideas I like oh

1113
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,269
we all could do something's cards and

1114
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,329
alphabets because you've got minute 52

1115
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:54,589
cards yourself about twice I should

1116
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,880
start having like a bank of like right

1117
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:58,430
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna use that

1118
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,319
and use that and the plot based a bit I

1119
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,279
really struggle with is the Ignite I can

1120
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,799
come up with like you need to do that

1121
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:07,219
why it's the right and the stuff that

1122
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:09,650
explains explains that this problem but

1123
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:11,569
again for the next time I'm yes I should

1124
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,289
try a bit simpler but then but then

1125
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:15,680
where's the fun in that

1126
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:17,209
no I want more things more things I'd

1127
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,219
say having hope would be the big thing

1128
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:20,660
is somebody to read me back a bit or

1129
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:22,910
somebody who's slightly better at

1130
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,239
management to like that's the stupid

1131
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:28,729
idea there isn't gonna be time but yeah

1132
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,859
once it's it's I can find hopefully

1133
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:33,319
improving next time this next time will

1134
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:36,739
be better and the time after that if I

1135
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:47,359
can get an invite back again anymore for

1136
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:48,859
anymore or sorry up I mean the

1137
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,180
brainstorming is a quick bit that's not

1138
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,328
you know I mean I'm thinking all the

1139
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,160
time so and again any not ideas for x1

1140
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:59,029
note the implementation is a problem I

1141
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,640
mean I I have no idea how long it took

1142
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:06,650
me to build that months and I'm gonna

1143
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,779
get not like a full-time job ya know

1144
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,009
it's it's a huge time sink which again

1145
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,299
is worried like getting more people to

1146
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:16,699
help would be good because then I could

1147
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:17,959
upload something work on them like again

1148
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:20,119
why should I should learn to control a

1149
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,370
bit more I should give myself a less to

1150
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,960
do

1151
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,069
but again I always think there's more

1152
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,510
that's more like a knife that's more

1153
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,730
with more bits as more bits as more bits

1154
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,080
and again I need somebody to ring me

1155
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:34,050
back in and say stop doing that make the

1156
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,049
first bit worth yes

1157
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,270
what's that what I did I'm not doing

1158
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,319
this talk like my career in general

1159
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:51,210
being friends with you

1160
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:51,210
I honestly done I don't know

1161
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,379
transporting like guns across the

1162
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,800
country proper wasn't the smallest news

1163
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,350
although I got away with it Hey mmm VW i

1164
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,570
rvw it sorry I just bought my new car

1165
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,440
but when I did that I fell asleep at the

1166
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,640
wheel on the way back because I'd

1167
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,610
basically be not for like to not days

1168
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,799
doing stuff like my VW has lovely

1169
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,450
adaptive cruise control so so

1170
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,590
front-facing radar basically so it

1171
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,569
stopped me playing at the back of the

1172
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:18,780
BMW about 90 when I dozed off of the

1173
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,280
wheel that was a stupid idea

1174
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,140
yeah problems again I got these events

1175
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,840
and I I don't sleep

1176
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,140
and I do far too much and you end up

1177
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,320
worn out but again it's worth it I need

1178
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,960
a driver for the next time oh yeah more

1179
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,179
or less

1180
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,179
[Music]

1181
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,020
well I mean because it's not like

1182
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,160
full-time work it's the source stuff you

1183
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,790
can pick up and do for a bit and leave

1184
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,259
and pick up and do for a bit and leave I

1185
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,850
mean like see at the event itself I'm

1186
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,650
physically burnt out but but this is

1187
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,540
it's worthwhile I don't mind that but no

1188
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,970
no in the planning building phase again

1189
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,860
I couldn't if I get I've had enough I'll

1190
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,419
leave it for a bit I say I mean the

1191
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,360
obvious happens is I've got too many

1192
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:08,890
ideas I need to do all this stuff nicely

1193
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:11,170
it's not been a problem yet yes stress

1194
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,270
to the yet but again I mean if it wasn't

1195
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,140
fun I wouldn't I wouldn't do it you know

1196
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,770
if it got the point of like oh I hear

1197
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,359
this why - yeah no the point is it is a

1198
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,340
lot of fun and you know it's very

1199
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,710
creative you know I don't do a lot

1200
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,080
that's particularly creative and my job

1201
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:28,630
is mostly disruptive my wife's ruin

1202
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,460
other people's stuff since I'd say it's

1203
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,080
nice to have something something that's

1204
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,430
a bit more on the creative side so it's

1205
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,430
not it's not being a problem boss fall

1206
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,989
[Music]

1207
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,690
yeah I mean I I think I think I said

1208
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,450
something you know when I did my

1209
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,710
chocolate beats them hey Manchester I've

1210
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,240
liked the trouble is like say you you

1211
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,490
think that you know how people are going

1212
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,959
to approach stuff and then invariably

1213
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,270
they don't so again it's trying to

1214
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,500
second-guess and it's trying to not make

1215
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,860
it so obvious that they're just

1216
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:09,730
following the set of instructions yeah I

1217
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,720
mean it is tricky and that's it and the

1218
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,950
plot in the background certainly for the

1219
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,689
first one it was like an afterthought

1220
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,950
it's oh my god I need to write some sort

1221
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,110
of Laurence so I just made a load of

1222
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,669
rubbish up whereas the second one I was

1223
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,980
again thinking more about it before I

1224
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,090
started so it just kind of flowed and

1225
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,320
the fact it was something about which

1226
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,940
I'm already I mean let's say

1227
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,290
post-apocalyptic role-playing games I've

1228
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,610
been a huge fan on forever so it's

1229
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,380
alright now I can I know stuff for this

1230
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:32,020
this is so that flowed a lot more easily

1231
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,180
than the one before

1232
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,740
again I think it's like next time I will

1233
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,870
come up with a plot first and then fit

1234
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,370
the challenges to the plot Ron the first

1235
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:42,060
time when I built the challenges and

1236
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:44,109
then tried to retrofit a plot to them

1237
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,210
but again you know my back room is not

1238
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,300
it's not like right and plots and things

1239
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,830
it's you know I'm a computer guy so

1240
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,370
again it's yeah it's different mummies

1241
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:56,200
do but it's it's yeah let's say that the

1242
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,950
second one was better the next one

1243
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,450
hopefully wasn't be better again

1244
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,460
but let's say it's gonna come up with a

1245
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,049
plot first and work stuff back and then

1246
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,610
again I suppose you know after the first

1247
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,920
one I was a lot more prepared for that

1248
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,570
so again it's like right stop writing

1249
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,460
documentation right at the beginning and

1250
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,700
then I said that the rest of its all

1251
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,700
flowed

1252
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,350
anymore or can we go to the pub now well

1253
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,110
you logged and got the pub now I need to

1254
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:25,779
go back to my lock-picking room now look

1255
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:28,770
at this thank you very much I can't

1256
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,770
believe I'm done in record time
