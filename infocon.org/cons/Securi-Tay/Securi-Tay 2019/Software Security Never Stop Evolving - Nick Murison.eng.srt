1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:15,260
one again one so well they're just left

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,240
I was gonna start by just saying that we

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,880
make thank you to the organising

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,310
committee and all the volunteers for for

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,680
setting this up I'll be looking at the

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,570
schedule and I'm blown away I don't know

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,390
what tractor sitting I'm gonna probably

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,000
be running between them much like I

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,850
imagine quite a few of you as well so

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,969
yeah I think thanks that and I think

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,510
maybe we can speak so this is the first

12
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:43,909
time I'm doing this particular talk so

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,178
it completely interesting to see laughs

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,960
so how many people have actually heard a

15
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:51,800
synopsis

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,010
oh that's impressive Oh excellent

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,828
so about three years ago we were at

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,870
thinking it was InfoSec in London and

19
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,489
people literally have no idea why

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,030
synopsis there who are you what are you

21
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,100
doing here thank you and actually

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,960
historically synopsis we're a hardware

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,890
company so what does that mean well if

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,389
you have my phone and iPad or any other

25
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,820
kind of electronic device and it has

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:22,219
like Bluetooth or USB or anything like

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:24,258
that chances are that the that the

28
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:26,538
vendor the creator of this device has

29
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,729
either used snotter's tooling or

30
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,350
software to create the designs and

31
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:33,259
schematics no thing or they've even used

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,600
some IP we have a bunch of patterns in

33
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,429
hardware design and implementation and

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,229
so that's where most of synopsis

35
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:41,420
actually says there's about 10,000

36
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,600
people of them on the company and we've

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,670
got the fourth has a lot of people in

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,350
the software and technical group now

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,749
synopsis other down this software take a

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,469
group a few years back essentially

41
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:56,869
through about acquiring companies so

42
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:59,809
it's not off with the medical Coverity

43
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,790
many people have clarity people make

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,750
sense of staff analysis tool when you

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,570
C++ and then we wonder for your

46
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,880
company's code nomicon fantastic bunch

47
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,890
of guys finish setting up an older in

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,230
northern Finland which pretty sure is

49
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,850
about minus 20 degrees at the moment

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,350
[Music]

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,510
they came up with a while they label

52
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,680
tool which is now called the fence X

53
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,200
today was called something else at the

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,880
time that they were once 2008 in TMS

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,420
Stan n three years ago they're quite a

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:36,500
complicated tool which is where I'm from

57
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:39,560
as well as a few people come see us

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,940
office we basically a suitable that

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,950
benign for our twenty five years doing

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,270
purely software security consulting so

61
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,299
we are consultants we do lots of

62
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,030
software's Qt stuff we don't have any

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,530
products present but all the other bits

64
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,530
they've got acquired what products as

65
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,270
well and then my book which some of you

66
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,280
might have heard of it's basically a

67
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,709
tool that you points that source code

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,920
where you pointed at a binary and it can

69
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,280
tell you what open-source components are

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,450
in there

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,459
and so you know are you in trouble

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,079
licensing wise or rather there are using

73
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:14,000
our to make versions than that and stuff

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,250
so from a consulting point of view we do

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,100
more security activities we don't just

76
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,830
be contestant and a bit about that in a

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,989
second we are down in the Gold Sponsor

78
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,350
area do come check us out speak to us

79
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:30,500
all very nice people all most of us want

80
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:33,290
to be there coffee this mean victory

81
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,330
marketing slight worry elimination

82
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,829
flowers specifically because you asked

83
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,100
me to mention flowers because it is your

84
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,050
favorite part about product platform so

85
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,840
yet we have women do products as I said

86
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,430
Coverity blacktop defense and so on I'm

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
actually that were building a platform

88
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,320
at them so we're putting more together

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,790
as one unified thing on that we have a

90
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,200
lot of services so you'll see we've got

91
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,570
a bunch of sort of testing security

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,750
testing services that we do which is

93
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,010
what in my team do behind

94
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,900
we have to do something what kind of

95
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,810
strategic proactive software security

96
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,570
things if you haven't heard of Beeson go

97
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,820
to be simcom it's a it's a science

98
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,400
experiment that would have been crazy we

99
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,410
we lost over 200 companies what they

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,090
actually do as per the software skills

101
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,459
program and we've built a kind of

102
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:23,409
statistical model out of what we heard

103
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:26,610
so anyway enough of the marketing oh my

104
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,800
that's a really big version of my face

105
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,450
so so I'm the head of the software

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,820
security consulting the organization for

107
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,310
the Nordics and Benelux in other words I

108
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,130
focus on Scandinavia Belgium Netherlands

109
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,780
Luxembourg that Canaria why do I have

110
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,740
that region well I grew up in Norway in

111
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,580
Bergen

112
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,820
so I can speak Norwegian in theory at

113
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,050
least that's that's you know that's one

114
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,040
of those things you never currently when

115
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,200
you see me that you're not willing to

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,970
back up well yeah when we got a quiet

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,370
way synopsis that they have a sales team

118
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,900
already in the Nordics who were doing

119
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,640
really well they got lots of customers

120
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,020
and they got me the assessment services

121
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,219
you know we would win an entirely

122
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,990
different kind of thing to the portfolio

123
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,990
so they were like Nick you speak the

124
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,000
leeches yes okay you have to go with us

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,830
to these meetings okay cool so I flew

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,570
over to Norway and certainly much of

127
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,400
customer meetings and the first customer

128
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,650
meeting that I was in where they decided

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,450
we have to do this in the region itself

130
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,909
kind of early enteral spiel and then

131
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,669
said Nick is gonna talk about Sean was

132
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,110
guilty net of you and that's the point I

133
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,359
remembered that I hadn't spoken in the

134
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,660
region on a day-to-day basis for 19

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,660
years

136
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:38,229
and also how do you say static analysis

137
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,188
security testing in The Witcher so that

138
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,080
was fun meeting

139
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,659
I've lived in Seattle in the US for a

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,889
while I got a high my company almost

141
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,629
straight out of university actually a

142
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,900
chemical found stone which got acquired

143
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,930
by McAfee which got acquired by Intel

144
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,068
and I did a bunch of assessing for them

145
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,669
it's over five years when I met my

146
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:58,990
lovely wife and I went monden so yeah

147
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,180
I've been a consultant for about 14

148
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,090
years I started off in penetration

149
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,930
testing all of it has so much fun broken

150
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,239
country stuff learnt a lot and then

151
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,969
having done that for a few years moved

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,349
back to London still is about McAfee to

153
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,659
help them build that consulting business

154
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:19,300
in New York and I sort of got dragged

155
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:22,090
into incident respond so much so he had

156
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,099
a lot of customers in McAfee customers

157
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,448
who kept getting hacked that's not a

158
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,569
comment on the product it's just you

159
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,400
know people get act and so we would sort

160
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,750
of parachuted in and I was just meant to

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,340
be a project manager and all of a sudden

162
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,050
that was on a plane you know ten hours

163
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,330
notice two women from countries in the

164
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,520
Middle East saying hi honey

165
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,080
yeah I'm off to a country in the Middle

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,628
East yeah don't actually know how I'm

167
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,279
coming back

168
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:49,629
four weeks later it was my record so

169
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,949
wasn't my favorite activity but it was

170
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,020
really exciting really interesting

171
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,419
another plot how much training and then

172
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,279
when I got on bisexual about five years

173
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,979
ago I got really into software security

174
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,750
and that's where sort of love being here

175
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,159
since go a bachelor's in computer

176
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,569
science from Exeter University

177
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,089
I've got master's in information

178
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:09,729
security from Huawei anyone heard of

179
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:13,900
that program and one big to that program

180
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:17,919
oh okay one thing one thing they don't

181
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,359
have is this which is fantastic you know

182
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,258
if they could organize a conference than

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,360
the body they couldn't do this off so

184
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,469
kudos to us yeah there's my email

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,430
address if you wanna follow me on

186
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:31,310
Twitter and I usually just remount about

187
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,670
cycling so but sometimes I post about

188
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,050
security

189
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,970
okay so let's first talking about

190
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,880
history so I'm going to sort of talking

191
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:45,980
about software development and security

192
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,170
and how for a very long time now they've

193
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,240
sort of not been very good friends they

194
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,060
haven't played well together and so I'm

195
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,740
gonna talk a bit about what's happened

196
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,630
what's happening and what compare what

197
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,950
I'm sort of seeing what we're seeing

198
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,130
kind of happening with a lot of

199
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,780
customers and sort of I've got some I

200
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,610
call them career suggestions but in

201
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,880
other word they were like humble

202
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,180
requests to come join us in in helping

203
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,560
companies develop our software so in the

204
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,180
beginning this is kind of how software

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,310
that what happens it's a really boring

206
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,200
slide it's meant to be you know

207
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,120
whichever kind of development process

208
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,870
you you follow this usually these kind

209
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,340
of find five steps may be complex or

210
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,140
depending so you've got unit

211
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,640
requirements analysis you build a big

212
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,400
list of everything you want the software

213
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,799
to do and then once you've got that you

214
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,840
go into design mode we design the

215
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,370
software to figure out okay plaid to to

216
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,460
make it do all those things needed to

217
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,280
look like this then you write the code

218
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,810
and then you test the code and then you

219
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,480
know in theory everything works we ship

220
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,099
it now what I've just described is

221
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,520
essentially the old classic waterfall

222
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,380
it's very linear you do all your

223
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,430
requirements analysis you draw a line

224
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,050
under it

225
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,239
there you go quite an hour working in

226
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,630
design and you can't change the

227
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,610
requirements in theory but you have to

228
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,260
and then you fight their families a

229
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,670
design you draw a line under it and then

230
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,470
you start implementing and you can't

231
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,810
change the design in theory but you have

232
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,420
to because you're about halfway through

233
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,520
writing the software and you realize oh

234
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,370
we forgot about the requirement about

235
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,600
usually security or something so now

236
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,920
we're going to go back to a cornice

237
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,270
analysis well how do we do that in a

238
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,240
linear process it's really expensive

239
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,270
it's really hard and so what of all

240
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,640
wasn't the best kind of model for this

241
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,380
at least one skill point of view so

242
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,990
there are more modern ways of

243
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,700
approaching this

244
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,230
that pretty much nobody uses pure

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,810
waterfall these days when they do

246
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,800
software buttons usually some agile and

247
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,959
scrum some CI city some demos and

248
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,199
wonderful things so they basically all

249
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,329
have the same components but they happen

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,550
in a different way so you let the scrum

251
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,260
also a sprint is usually a two-week

252
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,359
sprinter or something like that and so

253
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,760
you can't do all this you can't build an

254
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,529
entire per 2 weeks way to fly but when

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,240
you do is you pick a few the clients of

256
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,610
you user stories you try to limit that

257
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,680
as you're weeks and then the next two

258
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,839
weeks you repeat twice knowledge because

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,089
there's different ways of doing it each

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,500
rating these things but fundamentally

261
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:17,339
you're dealing with the same kind of

262
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:22,440
activities so yeah fixing problems

263
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,950
coming expensive still is so something

264
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,860
happened with the line that sees

265
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,570
everyone you know smashing a stack for

266
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,950
fun and profit

267
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,890
yeah excellent okay if you had already

268
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,690
got rid of it it is from 96

269
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,490
I think remember it's just been outdated

270
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,800
but the concepts are really well

271
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:45,180
explained really straightforward they're

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,709
talking by this guy called a loved one

273
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,420
or a Eli Levy and basically he's

274
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,760
describing you know in a seed program

275
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,620
you've got memory space and the

276
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,149
development is expected to only put

277
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,600
stuff into the memory space it's kind of

278
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,279
fitting well what if I put more in what

279
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,500
if I try pill more into that memory

280
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,339
space then the developer expected to

281
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,350
well things happen fun things happen so

282
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,959
the developers have had this inherent

283
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,290
assumption that people and systems etc

284
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,170
will use my software on my system the

285
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:22,649
way I intended to be used it turns out

286
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,860
you had hackers crackers fakers the RAND

287
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,350
Corporation military they all thought a

288
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,060
little bit differently they thought no

289
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,950
what can I make the software do on the

290
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,560
system do that it wasn't intended to do

291
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,870
how can I break it well how can I make

292
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,930
it

293
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,270
other things than what the girl expected

294
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,189
now this didn't come up in the nineties

295
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,140
like hacking penetration testing actual

296
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,839
penetration testing started its life in

297
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,300
the like the 1960s but something else

298
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:55,240
changed in the nineties so you know

299
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:01,459
stuff like frack got published and also

300
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,750
the internet happened so 395 issue not

301
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,339
all people on the internet you know

302
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:09,560
polish on the dial up modem this is a

303
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,800
see some way here in the audience you

304
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,790
you had the dial-up modems so a few

305
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,000
things happen you know the incident

306
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,010
became a really democratizing force not

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,290
just for your consumers but also clear

308
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,970
hackers and people who want to kind of

309
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,219
mess with systems so you have more

310
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,620
people messing with more systems so you

311
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,910
have more attackers even more tax

312
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,770
happening and you had a bigger attack

313
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,010
surface a lot of systems that were never

314
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,110
designed to speak to the outside world

315
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,860
speaking to the outside world by the

316
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,260
internet and yes but there was a lot of

317
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,690
kind of new new challenges for

318
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,810
developers the problems from developers

319
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,810
was they ten people you have less money

320
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,099
they were more shorter timelines and two

321
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,119
certainly something like in key skills

322
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,850
as well especially the security so

323
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,010
you've got the you've got this dichotomy

324
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,410
of lots more people looking at your

325
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,470
systems and you've got less time to

326
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,810
secure so you got this race between the

327
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,940
makers and the workers the developers

328
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,479
they're trying to cope with a scary new

329
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:17,570
world and you go ahead from that hackers

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,339
penetration testers etc you know

331
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,430
developing new capabilities new tools

332
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:26,000
new attack methodologies or methods new

333
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,670
pen testing methodologies we even have

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,740
delicious now we have that people have

335
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,699
to take it seriously and ID security

336
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,069
traditionally many network by the

337
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,959
infrastructure oriented

338
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:42,560
their response was very much along the

339
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,250
lines of it's okay we've got fire it's

340
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,899
fine

341
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,690
nothing bad will happen so a good

342
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:52,910
example of that was yeah well back when

343
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,389
I was doing instant response I got

344
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:59,149
dragged into one case where a company

345
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:01,790
clearly bleeding they've got but people

346
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,930
on the inside of the network and so the

347
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,029
first thing we did was we stopped the

348
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,269
bleeding we figured out okay have plug

349
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,850
the holes okay what happened let's look

350
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,829
at your a firewall Odyssey intrusion

351
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,269
detection logs and so on oh yeah

352
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,008
actually intrusion detection labs

353
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,509
they've got this alert this thing keeps

354
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,709
yelling at us about this thing but it

355
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,439
must be a false positive it can't

356
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:25,699
possibly be so why kind of be real well

357
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,959
because in with the the signatures in

358
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,878
the intrusion detection system you know

359
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,529
that the rules they were written at some

360
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,149
point in the rule will be time stamped

361
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,579
when it was written and this particular

362
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:37,759
rule that was in their system was within

363
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,589
ten years ago so can't possibly reveal

364
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,389
because they are me up today all the

365
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:43,220
windows patches so you know really old

366
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,759
rule triggering it must be a false

367
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:52,009
positive as I look at which rule is this

368
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:54,110
it's called a sequel injection right

369
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,850
okay so someone's been hammering your

370
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,949
front and website with sequel injection

371
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,380
that your intrusion detection system is

372
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,099
being young at you but you thought it

373
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,810
was a false positive

374
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,880
yeah okay turns out it wasn't a false

375
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,069
positive and what the family clean up

376
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,269
now these guys were really good at their

377
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:12,829
jobs they would have an Operations

378
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,569
Center people they were very good at

379
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,790
maintaining a secure Network and

380
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,380
patching systems but they didn't really

381
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,029
know much about application security so

382
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,089
they didn't know what sequel injection

383
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,880
was so you know it's fine we have a

384
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,160
firewall they it's not fine

385
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,250
meanwhile they've barely to thousands a

386
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,149
few things happened around what kind of

387
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:38,269
software security the kind of thing so

388
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,280
Bill Gates and Microsoft puts out a memo

389
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,800
I think every year

390
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,140
used to put out in that way every year

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,449
in one year that means met the tidal

392
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,180
wave I think was called then one year in

393
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,930
2002 it was trustworthy computing not

394
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,449
totally they hear very much these days

395
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,069
at the time who's the new thing from

396
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,590
exomes and they'll spit out this thing

397
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,570
called the secure about the lifecycle

398
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,180
they published a book and it's basically

399
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,480
how Microsoft wanted to do software

400
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,890
development with security baked in and

401
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,550
to some extent they did that for some

402
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,020
things and lots of other companies about

403
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,160
the book thought all this is brilliant

404
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,590
there are so many good ideas in here

405
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,850
let's use it at the same time or some

406
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,380
some clever guys there's a company

407
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:31,030
called suit all published a book called

408
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:34,810
software security and then there we

409
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,370
about the authors Gary Micco sending

410
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,319
Biggers and John Stevens and a few

411
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,850
others how did you yeah Pat go pack up

412
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,440
with some content in this as well if he

413
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,560
if you hadn't met Paco Paco used to be

414
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,250
as digital have a chat with him at some

415
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,829
point he left us the traitor he's now at

416
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:58,000
AWS but he's doing fantastic work there

417
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,470
well anyway so we put into the console

418
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,660
movies touch points you know in Salford

419
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,460
well that you have these activities well

420
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,829
for each of these kind of stages no

421
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,900
qualms analysis design etc there's

422
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,030
things you've the security things we can

423
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,530
do for each of them so that's that's

424
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,770
come up these touch points where we talk

425
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,349
about reaching these stages well to do

426
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:20,260
almost kind of thing around about them

427
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,480
as well and has now attended to it won't

428
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,829
be nearby fantastic organization with a

429
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,770
lot company a lot some really good

430
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:29,020
material you know if you're into you

431
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,210
know they're not just web start now and

432
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,790
they've got they've got mobile stuff etc

433
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,170
and I content for both you know if you

434
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,540
doing security testing how to do it

435
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,910
really good if you're a developer also

436
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,170
what's the problem with it sequel

437
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,880
injection cross-site scripting and so on

438
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:48,190
they got some really good video in there

439
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,520
as well okay so

440
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,610
so we had some few different ideas about

441
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,590
how to introduce security into software

442
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,699
development what did that look like well

443
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,689
everyone started with penetration

444
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,220
testing because everyone knew what it

445
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,800
was it was a it was a pretty cool effect

446
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,290
so we've got a bunch of applications

447
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,200
there how to live in the in the great

448
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,450
big world what can we do to them well we

449
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,300
can do a penetration test okay let's go

450
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,420
can test our systems or applications wow

451
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,790
that is a lot of bugs well I guess we

452
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,490
add those to the backlog so we had a

453
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,629
pile of security issues that we ended up

454
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,950
with but the problem is that these

455
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,760
applications were already like they're

456
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:33,550
already in production that's a bad date

457
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,490
we know that the holes and so how do we

458
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,320
fix them so okay how can we make sure

459
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,000
that we find these bugs before it goes

460
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
into production well let's let's do

461
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,990
let's do penetration testing before it

462
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,910
goes into production in a lot of

463
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,360
organizations what ended up happening

464
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:57,010
was you did penetration testing about

465
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,659
two weeks before you meant to go into

466
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,020
production thing is the penetration test

467
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,570
takes a week or two weeks all depending

468
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,830
you find some problems and then the

469
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,570
developer fixes them magically overnight

470
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:11,710
by just before at least that's yeah that

471
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,210
didn't really happen so what you ended

472
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,110
up with was we ended up with more a

473
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,660
bigger bug pile you need to have had but

474
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,040
it was still another production because

475
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,330
you have to mr. sesame oh well we can't

476
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:28,300
stop the release so big a pile still

477
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,129
doing pen testing okay well how can we

478
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,659
do things earlier let's do code than you

479
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,970
so let's look at the actual source code

480
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,130
and see if we can identify as security

481
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:41,610
bugs cool this is really boring to do

482
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,960
manually so the people invented tools

483
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:47,649
one of the first tools there for

484
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,360
security was called 80s for which was

485
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,600
development

486
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:55,229
one guy's assistants a while back it's

487
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,760
kind of a concept and if I know my

488
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,559
history correctly basically it's kind of

489
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,879
the case so well we're not going to do

490
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,110
much with it but it's a really cool

491
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,460
concept let's give it some venture

492
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,139
capitalists and they'll turn it into

493
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,210
something and they turn it into this

494
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,750
thing called fortify which became quite

495
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,460
big and I'm sure someone in our company

496
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,990
was kicking themselves a bit for you

497
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,380
know letting someone else one with it

498
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,529
because we probably could have you know

499
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,789
made it kind of a success as well but

500
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,779
yeah lots of tools out there looking for

501
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:27,570
bugs in your source code so we're adding

502
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,490
into the bug bottle we're still not

503
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,049
addressing okay well when are we gonna

504
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:36,120
fix it and how it must stop increasing

505
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:38,309
the book part so this is kind of what

506
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,739
maybe some organizations would consider

507
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:42,320
so they a secure software lifecycle

508
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,360
you're doing a bunch of different things

509
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,860
throughout the lifecycle so when you're

510
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
doing the climate analysis you make sure

511
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,709
that you come up with your securing

512
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,539
comments you come up with abuse cases or

513
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,429
tax stories or whatever you want to call

514
00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:00,658
them and you do some sort of risk

515
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,799
analysis we know okay well these you

516
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,120
know in this application I'm going to

517
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,289
talk to the internet and it's gonna be

518
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,590
handling credit card data

519
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:09,990
okay well that in bolsillo risks so

520
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,549
let's let's address those early so let's

521
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,399
come up with some Aquinas to try and

522
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,840
mitigate those risks then when we're

523
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:20,149
doing architecture design we if ever

524
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,480
blame any people different mine okay

525
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,610
fantastic

526
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,039
so you'd essentially you look at the

527
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:30,168
design the application and you say great

528
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,970
now as an attacker I want to get to the

529
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,110
crown jewels within the system how can I

530
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,990
get to them

531
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,399
perspective are there other security

532
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,900
controls are missing or are there

533
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,679
security controls that aren't up to

534
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,390
scratch can I get around them somehow

535
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:49,110
and then we do risk analysis on what we

536
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:52,049
find as we make sure we prioritize what

537
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,639
we need to implement early and talk

538
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,170
about code review again we would

539
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,340
penetration testing that's kind of just

540
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:00,210
a given and then once again production

541
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,610
will have some sort of security

542
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,130
operations center making sure that the

543
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,010
application states you know what his

544
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:12,900
knees on their tablets and then the bug

545
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:14,990
bounties fit in somewhere here that's

546
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,740
that's an entirely different talk

547
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,419
although I do feel like I should mention

548
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,370
one thing so we organized a conference

549
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,250
over here for all the companies applying

550
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,260
Beeson leveling security in maturity

551
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,590
model that I mentioned earlier and we

552
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,530
had met some come and give a talk one

553
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,730
year about bug bounties and it was

554
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,530
really interested in seeing basically

555
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,470
half the room for bug bounties were the

556
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,240
coolest thing ever and the other part of

557
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,059
the room thought is the dumbest idea

558
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,480
ever and the truth is problem solving

559
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,480
riddles

560
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:53,700
okay so hacking is fun penetration

561
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,299
testing is really good fun breaking

562
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,230
stuff is fun I I certainly enjoy doing

563
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,290
it

564
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,620
there were one of my earliest pen

565
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,149
testers I actually I just covered the

566
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,389
banner cookie and there seemed to be

567
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:11,130
something encrypted data in the cookie

568
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,870
and I ended up like because I was fairly

569
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,419
fresh out of my master's course I was

570
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,469
like I'm gonna crypto harm Isis so it's

571
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,330
something you know statistical else

572
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,190
aside some differential analysis on it

573
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,668
and I figured out aha

574
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:27,840
it's that's super crypto algorithm cold

575
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:29,429
Caesar shift with some bells and

576
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,600
whistles going on to it and so amazing a

577
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,790
sample of the pen paper

578
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,010
cracked this encryption code

579
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,260
flower I loved it it was so much fun

580
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,060
especially like explaining it to the

581
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,210
developers you know this is why they

582
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:52,230
don't like that they just blown away by

583
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:55,740
how could you do that it's rewarding as

584
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:59,940
well I mean anyone who do internal

585
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,760
network pen testing yeah first time I've

586
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,430
got two main happen that was such an

587
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,260
adrenaline rush it was so fun it was my

588
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,540
first ever internal pen test it was

589
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,220
really embarrassing because in found

590
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,020
stone we basically had to come an

591
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,720
unofficial leader board with regards to

592
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:19,170
how quickly from plugging in to getting

593
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,850
to main admin can you guess and I think

594
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,650
the record at the time was my boss

595
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:26,990
character Lee I think eaten in something

596
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:29,700
like 18 minutes like plug in when Ivan

597
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:33,150
and then what do you do the rest of the

598
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,910
week so you know who's first internal

599
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,110
men's s only plugged in mark I need to

600
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,900
get to make that I need to get to main

601
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:43,409
happen and it took me slightly

602
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:46,080
embarrassing a long time to do it had my

603
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,320
boss or like Skype messaging me like

604
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,800
over 20 misspoke dude I'm gonna go to

605
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,629
Manhattan yet so I finally got it felt

606
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,930
so good but we need so they were

607
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:00,030
personally rewarded about their fort at

608
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,950
making stuff is useful as well I mean it

609
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,250
with was shining a light on on the

610
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,200
issues where the developers had never

611
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,750
expected us to try and do this to their

612
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,260
system and you know how else were they

613
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,260
going to find it

614
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,659
slight problem breaking stuff does not

615
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:26,700
magically fix the stuff we still

616
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,770
something we have to do so and this this

617
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,110
can cause some animosity so if you're

618
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,980
the if you're the security guy and we're

619
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:39,060
talking to the developers and you're

620
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,179
breaking their stuff sometimes this will

621
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,109
come across as you walk into and

622
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,999
developers your baby is ugly and then

623
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,559
walk away

624
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:50,149
so something its independently

625
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,070
organization this isn't gonna go well

626
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:57,168
sometimes in fact one company I was at a

627
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,668
first day on site doing a weather pen

628
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,409
test I had to go outside to do it

629
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:02,539
security guy takes me down the hallway

630
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,759
walks me into this room full of

631
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:07,519
developers in fact the developers for

632
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:13,279
the system and they say and he says hey

633
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:14,899
guys this is me he's a ranger stuff how

634
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:22,789
much help did I get for those developers

635
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:25,218
that week so yeah actual quotes we we

636
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,509
can talk a bit amount as most of you

637
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,969
talk about penetration testing kind of

638
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:33,710
being a badass auditor in a sense it

639
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:38,320
easily useful but let's say you have a

640
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:40,279
pen tester go in and spend five days and

641
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,178
he comes back and gives you a report

642
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,919
saying I found these four problems what

643
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:50,779
do we know about the application base

644
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:55,099
tested but yeah I was gonna say more

645
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:57,200
politely but yes we know there are at

646
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:58,968
least four issues what if the pen tester

647
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,219
comes back and says I didn't find

648
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:04,969
anything

649
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:07,029
he's in a secure system look we don't

650
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:09,979
know essentially so yes you know we

651
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:13,969
don't know and we know we have some

652
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:16,519
problems so extra back in the sixties

653
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:19,669
you said this about testing software

654
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,969
testing we we can use testing to show

655
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:29,960
the presence of bugs but we can't prove

656
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:31,969
the absence of them I thought I'd talk a

657
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,539
bit about DevOps because it's the new

658
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:38,779
sexy thing what actually is last year's

659
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:40,399
thing is now at this point also big

660
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:44,149
shout out to the marketing department a

661
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,758
synopsis I gave them a really like bland

662
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:47,679
set of slides and they just like they

663
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,130
went

664
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,850
Shutterstock there's a really cool stuff

665
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,010
in it

666
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:58,689
I sound like tone it down slightly it's

667
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:00,310
yeah so okay so tell us what is it well

668
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,380
let's talk a bit about terminology now

669
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:05,560
people have different definitions of

670
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,140
other stuff so these are our kind of

671
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,659
definitions your mileage may vary but

672
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,450
essentially agile it's all about

673
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,890
processes so agile processes are common

674
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,770
in relatively four different kind of

675
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:21,520
development processes typically you're

676
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:23,800
focusing on on changing while making

677
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,040
changes to the functionality of the

678
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,360
application and so on and here we're

679
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,550
trying to optimize delivery so you're

680
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,610
trying to figure out how can we in an

681
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:36,760
agile manner make a change for software

682
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,399
quickly and then we have this thing

683
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,810
called continuous integration or

684
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,790
continues to live we call continuous

685
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:48,159
deployment CICE now that's more what

686
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,340
kind of tool focused it's basically how

687
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,080
can we define software drama life cycles

688
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,959
using software so we have a soft a

689
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,439
defined lifecycle essentially things

690
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,410
like bamboo so CI jenkins these kind of

691
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,930
tools fit in the other the ideas if

692
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,900
there's a task let's say compiling the

693
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:10,390
app that we can do with that having to

694
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,010
manually type something out let's find a

695
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,720
way of doing it automatically and that's

696
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,900
what build pipelines are etcetera

697
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,550
if we can test the app in some automated

698
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,830
fashion let's do that as part of our

699
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,700
Jenkins pipeline as well

700
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,740
and so yeah the focuses on automation

701
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,630
and then this DevOps been so DevOps

702
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:33,940
development and operations historically

703
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,750
development to over there operations

704
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,490
were over there

705
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:42,100
and security was done with the back

706
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:45,040
yelling just inane things and none of

707
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,270
them are talked together so if I was a

708
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,270
developer I was not allowed to touch

709
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,010
anything in operational interaction if I

710
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,930
wanted to make a change deduction I to

711
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,480
go to an Operations team and probably

712
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,700
open a ticket

713
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,650
and beg them pretty please coming here

714
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,420
can you make this change of me as the

715
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,000
vaults were very split off the idea

716
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,030
point DevOps is your one team where

717
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,780
development operations everything is in

718
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:11,220
one and so you're just redefining the

719
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,500
balls you need to find in the culture in

720
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,180
the organization and making more

721
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,910
responses so you've got one team those

722
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:21,060
responsible for the software all the

723
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,070
ways food development and in corruption

724
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,690
so you know the code I push out in

725
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,340
production is these microvilli

726
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,490
responsible for what happens when it

727
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,090
goes into production I have to respond

728
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,200
what we as if you have to respond so

729
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,939
this is what software levels are doing

730
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,840
you know they kind of gone than the

731
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,940
devil's food some of them some of them

732
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,510
very come to me in the cutting edge of

733
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,460
space

734
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,830
some of them March find their well some

735
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,050
of them have gone full DevOps a lot of

736
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,500
people like summer in the middle and

737
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:56,190
security kind of sitting on that going

738
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,960
once taps especially more security more

739
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,010
traditional security teams so you know

740
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,050
if you think back to like the more

741
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,850
formal approach that the linear approach

742
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,250
was really comfortable for security

743
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,719
because you know requirements analysis

744
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,560
and then security can come and go you're

745
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,650
gonna have a couple of security

746
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,270
requirements and cool we've signed up on

747
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,970
the crime so then the same thing happens

748
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,139
to design so you know the developers and

749
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,430
the architects they draw a nice design

750
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,330
and say this is what does not look like

751
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:27,510
you guys come in and go yeah okay we we

752
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:30,020
anoint this we accept it and so on and

753
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,070
all these activities were taking weeks

754
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,150
so a code review will take a couple of

755
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,040
weeks a pen test would take a couple

756
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,570
weeks it's up and so on spec model we

757
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,450
take a couple weeks

758
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:41,820
can't we do that in an environment where

759
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,640
your sprint is two weeks in that two

760
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,070
weeks we need to figure out which

761
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,710
features didn't how to change month and

762
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,980
for some point actually the

763
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,480
the do testing of it Spanish it we don't

764
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,010
have time to spend two weeks on

765
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,010
requirements analysis two weeks on that

766
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,720
only two weeks and code reviews etc so

767
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,700
security teams have to kind of refocus

768
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,820
and think about okay what do we trying

769
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,070
to accomplish not how can we speed up

770
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,760
the same old activities because you know

771
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,760
the wheels won't come off

772
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:18,600
yeah so developers use things like

773
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,780
Jenkins we could use things like Jenkins

774
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,879
in fact we have stuffing using things

775
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,899
like Jenkins this is just an example

776
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,780
that pipeline I'd built it myself thank

777
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,220
you the trick is to make all your

778
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,440
Jenkins stages empty

779
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,120
so nothing happens and that way you get

780
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,210
a green check mark for things it

781
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,479
succeeded so this is running on my home

782
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:45,780
Jenkins server doing nothing just it's

783
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,850
just they're making a speech oh so this

784
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,710
is an example kind of or what we might

785
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:52,649
do for some of our company for most of

786
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,420
our customers will go in and go what

787
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,640
security tools do you have what are you

788
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,320
trying to achieve what does your build

789
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,030
pipeline look like okay well I see if we

790
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,760
can insert some security stuff in there

791
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,560
so in this case we put in some static

792
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,550
analysis for security we put in some

793
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:11,220
dynamic testing and so on

794
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:14,340
so from us if it's feeling point of view

795
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,160
it's great that we're breaking stuff but

796
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,419
the developers aren't gonna love us for

797
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,910
making their stuff they're gonna love us

798
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,290
for telling them and helping them fix

799
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,950
the stuff and prevent it from happening

800
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,730
in the future

801
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,840
so they from that perspective if we're

802
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,970
not if we're not speaking the language

803
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,428
of development if you're not using the

804
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:36,749
same tools the same processes

805
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:44,820
with their current worldview we're not

806
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:49,919
really doing software security so winces

807
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,600
like me I wasn't sure how to title the

808
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
slide I start off with some career

809
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,100
advice but that sounded a bit arrogant

810
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,619
so I've done with career suggestions

811
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,158
they also considers to be some humble

812
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,658
requests from someone who is constantly

813
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,639
from the higher people who know the self

814
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:13,109
as purity if you don't know how to

815
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,480
program to learn it you don't have to be

816
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,940
like fantastically talented software

817
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,290
developer but you don't have to know

818
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,819
every language is you're not that you'd

819
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,250
have to know a specific language you

820
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:27,089
pick something up you know uh I think we

821
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:29,429
probably in our office in London on a

822
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:34,469
semi weekly basis we have like a

823
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:36,690
religious war brewing because Matthew is

824
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:39,589
very much the Python guy

825
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm inverse banished the JavaScript guy

826
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:47,339
and then someone will run into the room

827
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,918
and go go lie and one that chaos ensues

828
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,839
so yeah it doesn't have to be specific

829
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,549
like the lines of the content compare

830
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,099
their concepts you know like functional

831
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,960
programming lambda functions

832
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,190
object-oriented stuff this is very

833
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,240
useful when you're talking to developers

834
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:07,470
so when you've sort of given them your

835
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,680
pen test report and says yeah baby I'm

836
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:14,490
not gonna call it ugly but it's got some

837
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,078
issues then you're gonna have a much

838
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,549
more fruitful and can start a

839
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,500
conversation with the developers if you

840
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:23,369
can speak the language if you can relate

841
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,569
to them in the concept of okay more

842
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:26,700
frameworks say using more than that

843
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:29,009
framework if you use this function it's

844
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:34,589
better than if you use this function for

845
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:36,420
example and in one way you might do this

846
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:39,750
is find a pet project you know I've

847
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,210
always wanted to do you know a bit of

848
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,079
PHP programming you know okay write

849
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,859
several web

850
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:49,380
to something or or or invitin I'm sorry

851
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,739
Matthew sorry

852
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,539
so yeah you can blog about it you know

853
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:56,880
fill it up get to put on bitbucket or

854
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:57,959
whatever or you know if you don't know

855
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,459
saw something Scratchy

856
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,899
there's a plenty of open source projects

857
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,700
out there that especially in the

858
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:07,640
security space that could do with some

859
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,640
help so you know stop contributing I

860
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,058
don't know why I keep using the clicker

861
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:17,640
external networks another thing is

862
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:22,019
learning architecture our Software

863
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,180
Architect training why so learn things

864
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:26,839
like you're one of those frameworks do

865
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:31,739
you know one Java spring day wasn't

866
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:33,420
fails do and so on and how can they help

867
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:34,259
the developers as I save you a lot of

868
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,989
time when we're having conversations

869
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:39,509
with developers about I found some

870
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:41,549
problems then a lot of times it can come

871
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:43,349
down to look if you use the framework

872
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:46,229
like this you're going to avoid these

873
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:50,339
problems so if you if you learn how they

874
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:52,249
work you can be helpful become fluent in

875
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:56,630
things like entir application

876
00:36:52,249 --> 00:37:01,129
architecture and other fun phrases which

877
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,130
architects will use to to bamboozle you

878
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,229
I had one conversation once where it was

879
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:09,900
an architect way we came up with we said

880
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:12,299
look we don't have any requirements for

881
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,089
the software we have principles

882
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,140
[Music]

883
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:17,420
so we talked a bit about it and it turns

884
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,379
out they were requirements they just

885
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,799
didn't want to call them requirements

886
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,289
website yeah this becomes super helpful

887
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:26,819
when you're starting from language you

888
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:30,180
need to be able to understand design

889
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:31,619
language design throw up diagrams

890
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,029
anything be able to even troll them as

891
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:41,269
well Visio will become your friend sort

892
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:45,690
of and also not every security issue is

893
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:49,288
a buck something that design flaws

894
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:52,020
so what I mean by that well okay the way

895
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:55,380
we talk about bugs and forces bugs are

896
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,030
mistakes that you make in the code so

897
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,630
you forget assembly color wall or you

898
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:05,130
invent your placement wrong or so some

899
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:07,140
nothing so my biggest problem with my or

900
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,490
you know you you meant to take one

901
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,020
barrel and add it to another big

902
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,910
actually subtract or something like you

903
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,400
know you your your intention was correct

904
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:18,839
but you that fingered something that's a

905
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,549
book a designer floor is where when you

906
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,690
design the application

907
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:26,430
you forgot about something or didn't

908
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,599
quite design it right so maybe you

909
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,940
forgot to put in an authentication

910
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,589
that's a pretty big forgetting something

911
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,970
it does happen or you think you've

912
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:37,859
designed like an authorization scheme

913
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,839
that will protect all the crown jewels

914
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:42,740
but actually you left a great big gaping

915
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,960
hole over here on the left or something

916
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:52,109
and so here's an example of where that

917
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:55,490
Nova design for this is my cat Alex if

918
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:55,490
alex is a big

919
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,529
he's not really he's just really

920
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,669
affectionate and when he doesn't get

921
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:13,869
affection from me or my wife he turns to

922
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:15,700
his friend the Rumba now the way I

923
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:17,589
discovered this was basically and I come

924
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,089
home from work and there's a rumba in

925
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:25,569
the corner with a dead battery and he

926
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:29,109
kept happening and then one day I was

927
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:31,450
working from home I Alex's asleep on the

928
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:33,759
beds in the bedroom and I hear the rumor

929
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,019
go do do it's gonna start as thing and

930
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,309
how to get off the bed at once

931
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:40,629
downstairs what is happening

932
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,369
Alex has figured out that to get

933
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:47,349
affection teaches us wait for the uber

934
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:50,140
to wake up and it gets passed so this is

935
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:52,089
what I call and design for because the

936
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,980
makers or uber have done lots of many

937
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:57,000
clever things but one thing they've

938
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:02,859
never planned for was what I call the

939
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,309
attention-seeking cat abuse case so he

940
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:08,049
has finally stopped doing this but they

941
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:17,549
know we had better buy a new battery for

942
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:20,519
the robot okay who could does come it

943
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:23,259
prefers hard if it gives me a headache

944
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,848
but it is worth knowing a bit about it

945
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:27,849
getting familiar with it some a history

946
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:31,089
of it you don't have to become a math

947
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,920
whiz but knowing why it's hard to get

948
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:34,480
bites is really happy because that's

949
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,089
when there's some classic mistakes that

950
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
have been made I've had a lead of

951
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:45,009
Schroder

952
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:47,319
I picked the video example I want to

953
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,730
thank professor County pastor in a hot

954
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,920
way for this wonder if he made us all

955
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,849
this as part of our network security

956
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,710
mask so neither interpreter clever

957
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:58,569
people they came up with two

958
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,940
authentication protocols back in 1978

959
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:03,160
one with secret key base one was public

960
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,480
key based and they only took about three

961
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,890
years for someone to break the secret

962
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,420
key base one and in fact there's a

963
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:13,848
replay attack but the public key

964
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,680
actually was fine for another well for

965
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,000
about 17 years until someone figured out

966
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,230
last year there's a man in middle of

967
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,140
attack innocent

968
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,420
so really smart people coming up with

969
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,910
what looks like a really clever idea

970
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,400
and it seems to be clever and then 17

971
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,799
years later someone goes actually has a

972
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,069
really simple way of attacking it so

973
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:36,619
it's really hard to get bite and the

974
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:39,980
similar story for things like our c4 and

975
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:44,180
b5 and quite a few other algorithms and

976
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,380
protocols out there so it's I'm not

977
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,839
looking for anyone to start inventing

978
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,519
crypto I'm looking forward sort of you

979
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,640
know if people can get their heads

980
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:55,129
around why why smart people do dumb

981
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,359
things I Spit my heart opening it but

982
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:02,950
you know why these things can happen

983
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:05,000
okay you don't need a bigger box which I

984
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,589
think this goes without saying

985
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,299
especially given they are looking at the

986
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:10,339
schedule over the part of the next day

987
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:14,299
you know it's not just about web apps

988
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:16,369
although I think we probably spend but

989
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:19,009
we in a half the testing work that we do

990
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:24,049
if not more is web apps

991
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:25,460
we don't know mobile testing as well but

992
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:28,880
of a half of all the work that we do is

993
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,220
probably web apps but we we do love an

994
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,250
interesting work in things like Internet

995
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,939
of Things automotive medical devices

996
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:40,700
that kind of stuff mainly and it's sort

997
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,769
of in which pickings in the sense that a

998
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:47,629
lot of these technologies are being

999
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:50,500
built without necessarily co2 being a

1000
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,759
main player in the beginning so

1001
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,269
miscounting a repeat other mistakes made

1002
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:57,799
in previous generations of technology

1003
00:42:55,269 --> 00:43:01,788
and this is where you can bring a lot of

1004
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:04,788
value by both demonstrating in the

1005
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:07,170
issues with the technology but if you

1006
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,330
can speak your thoughts totally

1007
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:13,440
how to avoid the issues and how to fix

1008
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:17,400
the issues that's that will be you'll

1009
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:23,100
become someone's best friend embrace

1010
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:25,530
everything as code you I feel like I

1011
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,089
should mention AWS at this point you

1012
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,800
know aw surviving gotten to pet that

1013
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,570
much come down the road of everything is

1014
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,400
code you know why infrastructure is code

1015
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,680
our network is code our policy is cold

1016
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,540
you know who's gonna be the one document

1017
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:44,970
nobody who's going to make their their

1018
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,590
code passed a bunch of security

1019
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,959
requirements are built into the build

1020
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:52,380
process everyone because they don't want

1021
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,740
to have to deal with the friction build

1022
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,360
pipelines that will come now Jenkins etc

1023
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,569
security sensors we can write them as

1024
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,160
code now so if it's you know if it's

1025
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,230
champions pipeline you have a Metasploit

1026
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,210
script or anything it's all code and

1027
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,540
these will end up speaking stuff and

1028
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:12,900
getting that so I'm sure there are other

1029
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,310
examples I've forgotten here consider

1030
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,200
being a security champion within the

1031
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:19,230
organization where you work or at

1032
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,149
someone will work if you're studying so

1033
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,590
as I said you know you've got these caps

1034
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:26,070
you've got security you've got a lot of

1035
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:28,380
printing operations and so on one thing

1036
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:31,200
that we found is it's a tends to be a

1037
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,400
lot easier to teach a developer about

1038
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,960
security than they is to try and teach

1039
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,160
combat or traditional IT security person

1040
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,390
about how to speak to developers is it

1041
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,990
just seems to work better the other way

1042
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:49,620
right so in other organizations where we

1043
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:51,689
work the sophists unit group is able to

1044
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,750
be relatively small because they've got

1045
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,400
these champions in the engineering and

1046
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,950
calamities who they're developers so

1047
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,440
they're architects and so on but they

1048
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,689
have a passion for security they they

1049
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,600
know about security and they become some

1050
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,770
of the focal point within their team for

1051
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,170
security so this office view does not

1052
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:13,660
yell at everyone there's people actually

1053
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:18,070
embedded in the organization so they

1054
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:20,589
come in a sweet spot and don't forget

1055
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:24,310
about culture so different organizations

1056
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:25,839
have different cultures so you've got

1057
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,950
kind of the developers and security that

1058
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,720
kind of an awesome band all

1059
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,720
organizations and depending on the

1060
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,299
corporate culture that can be really

1061
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,500
brutal awesome then in other

1062
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,160
organizations a little bit more

1063
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,810
collaborative so if you're if you're a

1064
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,220
consultant on sides of the organization

1065
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,190
where they've got a very sort of us

1066
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,990
versus them culture you're gonna have to

1067
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,140
work harder to win over the developers

1068
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:53,169
and so be conscious or be conscious of

1069
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,170
that so holiday and technologies keep

1070
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:58,180
changing but you know the people where

1071
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,880
we can we all kind of stay the same and

1072
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:08,379
since that all of our hang-ups and we'll

1073
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:10,750
have our cultural kind of parents so so

1074
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:16,510
in summary finding security issues is

1075
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:19,570
the easy part doesn't mean it's easy I

1076
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:22,390
mean it's it's really hard it's really

1077
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:26,530
challenging and I've spent like how long

1078
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:29,098
staring at one particular system where

1079
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:32,710
I'm cleaning I'm sure there's a whole

1080
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:34,450
think I can get through it I just wasted

1081
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,460
five days trying to figure that it can

1082
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,149
be really hard to really challenging but

1083
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:41,770
relatively speaking it's the easy part

1084
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,240
because once I found an issue the

1085
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,040
developers then have to go fix it they

1086
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,959
have to figure out the payroll how can I

1087
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,060
fix this in such a way that nobody can

1088
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,810
do that particular attack and anything

1089
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:56,830
that looks a bit like it has anyone got

1090
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,259
a pen test where they found a cross-site

1091
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,240
scripting issue and then the report they

1092
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,640
say okay steps to reproduce go to this

1093
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,379
page put in this into the input field

1094
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,910
this particular value into the input

1095
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,710
field and click go and voila you have a

1096
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:13,460
I scripting attack and then the

1097
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:19,700
developers fix it by blacklisting just

1098
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:21,619
that example happens one so the valves

1099
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,569
aren't used to this kind of approach

1100
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:26,990
they're not thinking about how or do I

1101
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:29,089
need to escape values and you know trees

1102
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,848
it's a trust boundaries and how do i do

1103
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:35,119
encoding etc they're thinking that is an

1104
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:38,329
attack I need to start with that so it's

1105
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,619
it's hard to get get things right and

1106
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:41,440
then ultimately implementing these

1107
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:44,180
issues from happening in the first place

1108
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,569
that's the biggest challenge of all and

1109
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:49,609
where where organisations will spend

1110
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:50,420
literally millions trying to trying to

1111
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:59,720
solve this problem

1112
00:47:50,420 --> 00:48:05,559
so be conscious of that magnitude by the

1113
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:09,500
way we're hiring so yeah love we've got

1114
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,299
someone back we'll be at at this panel

1115
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:15,049
all day as well I so please become at

1116
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:19,630
the chat if he leaves in working with us

1117
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:24,259
we have consulting positions open with

1118
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:26,119
interns this summer as well so if I have

1119
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:27,829
to admit I'm trying to think of a

1120
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,980
berkeley alumni do we have in the office

1121
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:32,390
right now sonic physics and quite a few

1122
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,549
of them came through coming into our

1123
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,900
program so we we brought them in over

1124
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:38,660
the summer between the second or third

1125
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,900
year how lots of fun and then we ended

1126
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:44,808
up hiring so please do come talk to us

1127
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,119
if you're interested you'll find you'll

1128
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:50,269
find some friendly habit a alumni and

1129
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:56,299
then you'll find some other people we

1130
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:58,720
try to be nice as well with that thank

1131
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:58,720
you very much
