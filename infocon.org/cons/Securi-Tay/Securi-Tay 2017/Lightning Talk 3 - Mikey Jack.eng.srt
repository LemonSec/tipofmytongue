many of my tops this is hopefully going

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,460
to be a semi educational<font color="#E5E5E5"> rant about the</font>

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,350
future or TLS it falls on quite nicely

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,029
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> grahams talked earlier so if you</font>

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,720
saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of the perfect</font>

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,579
companion and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,460
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future of TLS next sort of</font>

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,550
you so the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome and mozilla</font>

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,370
are doing in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> deprecating htpc</font>

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,319
and the highly highly impressive

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,718
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> that M</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome's usable security</font>

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,550

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,420
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface and we'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,910
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at TLS 1.3 and some of the</font>

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,250
stuff that the CEOs of whom are having a

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,099
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> going ahead in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of women's</font>

their expiry time and all that sort of

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:10,470
thing and so yeah and HTTP is pretty

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:14,580
much dead or can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear me now that's</font>

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,539
sweet yeah so HTTP is dead by and large

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Google are announced plans to</font>

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,150
eventually mark all pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh HTTP and as</font>

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,729
non-secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought this out and</font>

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple on iOS or enforcement app</font>

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,549
Transport Security which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will have a</font>

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,040
look at so theoretically<font color="#CCCCCC"> and HTTP is now</font>

32
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,909
widely regarded as insecure also it

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,409
should dial right and not quite as

34
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,899
quickly as we'd like right if your

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,119
google and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing pretty well and</font>

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,740
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire Google of state</font>

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,040
eighty-five percent of all requests they

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,470
see an HTTPS a hundred percent of gmail

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,409
traffic is HTTPS you cannot access gmail

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,530
across HTTP youtubers at ninety-eight

41
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,680
percent and their ad networks are eighty

42
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,630
eighty eight percent and calendars and

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,099
the high 90s as well right so so they're

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,799
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well and so just ignore</font>

45
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,569
this the current now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 256 so if you're</font>

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,569
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> from at the moment and you're</font>

47
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,480
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> chrome 50</font>

48
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,999
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially what the you I</font>

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
used to look like and you just get this

50
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:24,310
this little I hear there was no

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,519
indication about the lack of HTTPS and

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,799
now if you go to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> inky DG page that</font>

53
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,340
asks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a password or credit card and</font>

54
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:35,609
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will see this rate</font>

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,620
it's no mark there's not secured and

56
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:40,659
firefox have got similar plans to follow

57
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this as well and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is live</font>

58
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,760
until now and firefox and the we're

59
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:47,858
supposed to go live at the end of

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">january but i think they ran</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font>

61
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:52,030
these run into some edge cases with the

62
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,620
warnings they were displayed on the

63
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,359
actual empty boxes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m</font>

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">preventatively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and then the eventual</font>

65
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,069
plan for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP kgs in chrome is that</font>

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,889
you'll be sure in this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large very</font>

67
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,458
skinny and not secure dialogue right in

68
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:12,010
the Europa so this by and largest is

69
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,159
pretty good right and it Kiki should be

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,399
considered harmful and having said that

71
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:21,310
and not secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually secure in a</font>

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,609
browser to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard person is very</font>

73
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,470
confusing right and the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

74
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,139
it was scotch business resilience enter

75
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,120
and we spend a good five minutes

76
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,829
explaining to people what our

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,780
certificate means and what the presence

78
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,250
of a king<font color="#E5E5E5"> pad what means and we could</font>

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,169
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people about this like half an</font>

80
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,530
hour and they would still look at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

81
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:43,810
tall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just weeks late so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is by</font>

82
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,000
no means a solved problem and you know

83
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,329
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chrome usable security team and</font>

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">emily stark ab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> john porter felt and you</font>

85
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,629
know they've done some excellent

86
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,340
research and getting us to where we are

87
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,209
at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's definitely a</font>

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,939
lot more to be done and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

89
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:04,229
Mozilla and so I think if the the cruel

90
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,608
one is from September of 2016 and

91
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:10,060
Mozilla<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the cool guys is the first</font>

92
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:12,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">way back in April 2015 and they are</font>

93
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,530
pretty much following the same the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

94
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,620
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of style as Google here right and</font>

95
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,289
you will get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L bar and</font>

96
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,099
and a lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> more helpful you will</font>

97
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:25,900
actually get contextualized warning so

98
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">chrome as well are going to offer these</font>

99
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,198
these types of contextualized

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">mornin but it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a gradual</font>

101
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,120
rule and they are really quite invested

102
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,889
and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> skiing the shadow of the general</font>

103
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,620
public in terms of marking the whole

104
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,889
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> as insecure and super skinny</font>

105
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,509
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be gradual so</font>

106
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,479
one of the things that they're doing and

107
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:50,889
as part of this for example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

108
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:54,370
so look at first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've used this</font>

109
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,180
crocodile swim and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for example</font>

110
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,919
will appear in incognito mode first the

111
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,240
rationale being that when you're in

112
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,219
private browsing you have a higher

113
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,229
expectation of privacy therefore and

114
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,320
each key key key is considered extra

115
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,300
harmful<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus HTTP right and so that's</font>

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,090
the sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> boy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there looking at and</font>

117
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,590
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple as well so require an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app to</font>

118
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,969
you secure network connections over

119
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,888
HTTPS the introduced in iOS 9 called app

120
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,349
Transport Security which is of just a

121
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:27,280
fancy apple market interest in turn on

122
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:29,020
HTTPS and they're hard deadlines for the

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,859
requirement of app Transport Security

124
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,469
was the end of 2016 and but cryptography

125
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,289
is hard the hard deadline<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows on</font>

126
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,970
announce some point in 2017 and but the

127
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,650
likelihood of by the end of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

128
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,470
want filters from an app to the app

129
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,659
store or have an update approved and if

130
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:53,740
you're using HTTP which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

131
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:55,449
excellent and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps the the biggest</font>

132
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,220
thing that will happen this year or has

133
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:01,419
happened this year's is the deployment

134
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,520
TLS 1.3<font color="#E5E5E5"> and TLS 1.3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and really is quite</font>

135
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,530
a special beast and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font>

136
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other versions of TLS of the past</font>

137
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,448
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> court here and i should say</font>

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,729
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get into this i shamelessly</font>

139
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,770
pillage the web and daylights out of the

140

cloud player blog for all these graphics

this quote here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people while sorta</font>

150
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,310
is pretty much sums up and the

standardization process for TLS up until

152
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,840
now so hard leaders are a perfect

153

example of us and the Hartley extension

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,760
came along it seemed you know that this

155

seems logical the vegan part is sound

156
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,020
you know let's just buying that in there

157
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,760
and and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a year later we're</font>

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,180
you know the openssl bugs came around

212
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,360
and know it seems like we're kind of

<font color="#E5E5E5">hitting the point of maturity or at</font>

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of various things that happen</font>

219
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,040
and politically and technically mate so

220
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,950
the the first thing we got rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and</font>

221
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,439
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god forsaken RS a handshake so</font>

222
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,700
the be clear i see is completely fine

223
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,010
which those struggles the fact that

224
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,520
began adjust but the is a key exchange

225
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,410
em is not good we do not like it purely

226
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,500
because it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air forward</font>

227
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">secrecy so with a static is a handshake</font>

228
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,620
and your server private key is what is

229
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,600
protecting all of the connections<font color="#E5E5E5"> late</font>

230
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the classic example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is and the</font>

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,819
the private key they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt</font>

server that the FBI had<font color="#CCCCCC"> their sits up</font>

237
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,730
they could then decrypt them so we face

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,410
this out for just be helming ephemeral

239
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,810
or elliptic curves that we have in a

240
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,490
panel basically the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that we</font>

241
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,920
had we still have our server private key

242
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,080
but for every session we generate a new

243
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,329
session key based off of that private

244
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,790
key so if you if you compromise the

245
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,890
server's private key you cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

246
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,410
decrypt any of the sessions right and

247
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,910
this is in the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> age of national</font>

302
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,209
compression as well we chucked that and

303
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,540
when your compressed and encrypted stuff

304
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:58,179
or encryption in compression does not

305
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,849
always play well together right and and

306
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:05,049
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the renegotiation as well</font>

no and TLS 13<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate so it was understood</font>

315
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,210
that at some point pls 12 probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

316
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,750
to fall victim to some sort of

317
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:34,530
catastrophic failure so we need a way to

318
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:37,080
operate pls 120 130 ls13 and and not

319
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,870
have one to screw us and when some

320
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,140
vulnerability comes with so the what

321
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,280
they came up was was hiding this and

322
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,540
downgrade signal pretty similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

323
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,870
n-c-a-a see the green was talking to

324
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,660
vote and they serve a random value and

325
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,000
basically and a 1.3 client will nota

326
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,790
loot for this so if you attempt to

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,130
downgrade and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our client who's aware</font>

328
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,230
will work for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and essentially works</font>

329
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,570
the same way that grim explained the CVS

just all and<font color="#CCCCCC"> no thank you whereas a 1.2</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go have a look at how deity</font>

seemingly clever<font color="#CCCCCC"> this might m not weak</font>

339
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">so clever in a few years right and the</font>

340
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,660
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is and let's encrypt so and</font>

341
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:38,670
the barrier to ssl/tls is usually being

342
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,680
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go by affair and syrups cost</font>

343
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,030
money and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to spend</font>

344
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">money on security because there's no</font>

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,430
tangible benefit unless you're like

346
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,600
blocking boy d in screwed right and but

347
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,760
essentially you can get free

348
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,350
certificates from these guys and the

349
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,300
certificate last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days and</font>

350
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,740
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can automatically do it the</font>

351
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,329
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all made and it's</font>

352
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,600
entirely free and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and ah</font>

353
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,070
yes so the 9th ed thing and we are

354
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,780
planning to get our mail server at work

355
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">upgraded so let's encrypt certificate</font>

356
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,170
because the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 and</font>

357
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,790
there's no broken and the nice man

358
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,219
informed us that 90 days is a

359
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,939
ridiculously short time for certificate

360
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,480
and however this again<font color="#CCCCCC"> rangely view of</font>

369
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:48,569
it gets compromised and you know at the

372
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,930
it's a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sexual to say the</font>

least<font color="#E5E5E5"> late so the thinking here is that</font>

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,709
if you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate compromise</font>

00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">its then valid in the hands of an</font>

kind of screws at the morn and you have

403
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,369
to do it manually and but if you're on
