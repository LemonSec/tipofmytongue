[Applause]

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:15,839
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually my fifth year at</font>

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:22,080
security in a row so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite happy to</font>

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:26,369
be like okay so this is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a weird</font>

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,570
talk in that have changed a bit I'll

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain why in a minute there's an</font>

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,780
asterisk<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an implementation for</font>

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,940
reason so hello so I'm grams of the loop

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">I used to work the portcullis and then</font>

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,329
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got bought by Cisco so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i work</font>

12
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:49,099
francisco i'm on twitter exchange you

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">can email me whatever i don't care</font>

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,670
mandatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so are things went a bit</font>

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,309
wrong with this talk I did the usual

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,989
thing you know you submit a talk and

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,369
then it gets accepted and then you do

18
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:09,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work how you do it right and then</font>

19
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,369
last week I got ill find engine work so

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,750
instead I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always sort of flip this talk</font>

21
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:19,710
around a little bit so it's going to

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:25,080
sort of focus more on the approach and

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,089
the tool that I wrote yeah so this talk

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,060
is a little bit different to what might

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,710
have been advertised<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hug the interim</font>

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,110
um so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you here have done a</font>

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,729
web app or infrastructure assessment and

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:46,049
scanned at cell pls configuration cool

29
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:51,000
right so you know you do append s or

30
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:56,310
whatever and you check<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS or whatever</font>

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,570
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running tell a solar cell and you</font>

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,939
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's like sweets are</font>

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,779
enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> versions of tail acts or sell</font>

34
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:08,609
versions are enabled so you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> curator</font>

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,610
um but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really do enough in that</font>

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,750
regard are we really covering that

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,720
domain

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,700
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL which is a fairly big protocol</font>

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> well they say lyric protocol in</font>

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,209
terms of the number of vulnerabilities

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,420
that can exist because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's crypto and</font>

42
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:28,710
it's hard and because it's code and it's

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,859
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write secure network code that's</font>

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,440
passing binary data and things like that

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,820
anybody who's ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen sn1 passing</font>

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,910
vulnerabilities and the number of them

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">can sort of understand how many of the</font>

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,840
villages exist in that space also I'm

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,989
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at what tools do we have</font>

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,230
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment and whether we can do any</font>

51
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:58,860
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do so here's a bit</font>

52
00:02:52,230 --> 00:03:02,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a history Sally abridged a XSL issues</font>

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,750
ish so stuff around<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL or exploitation</font>

54
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,700
so let's start out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beasts in 2011</font>

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,280
sort of protocol issue then you've got a

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,709
crime which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is round compression issues</font>

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,920
then you've got breach which is a sort

58
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,510
of evolution of that sort of

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,018
side-channel attacks and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

60
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,690
hardly which sure all of you saw or the

61
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonderful marketing around that then</font>

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,209
you've got poodle and then the magic

63
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,260
version of poodles on TLS as well um

64
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,660
that was quite an interesting one

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,380
because it shouldn't have worked on TLS

66
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,180
but it turns out that some

67
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementations implemented just</font>

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically copy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paces the XSL v3 code</font>

69
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,810
into that TLS implementation even though

70
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complies with the</font>

71
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">taylor spec and therefore we got poodle</font>

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,049
probability on telus as well let me log

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,670
jam which is very interesting there's

74
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,410
all sorts of fun nation-state stuff

75
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:01,380
around that ah then freak sweet 33 with

76
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,579
ribbon we're seeing quite a few s cell

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,510
phone abilities and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a chat</font>

78
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:11,760
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody Martin Jack earlier</font>

79
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,980
somewhere in the in the bar and saying

80
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,989
what seems like no there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

81
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,488
lots of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellphone abilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

82
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">telecom abilities that just sort of</font>

83
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,349
popped<font color="#E5E5E5"> up out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the middle of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere</font>

84
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the last sort of five six seven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

85
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,010
and everybody just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw us assume that</font>

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the openssl go</font>

87
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,030
a big team and it was all open so Gloria

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,500
and it says that's like five dudes on a

89
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:40,049
40 grand budget yeah not everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

90
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,240
great so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a summary as a</font>

91
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,890
problem that I see with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,900
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Excel teller server and also</font>

93
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,060
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax on it so the many eyes</font>

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works when many trained</font>

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,080
eyes are actually looking so over

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,160
openssl<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone would know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

97
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,479
love funding them I think maybe and it

98
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,120
turns out that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really funding</font>

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,500
them and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty looking so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
whole like open source is great because

101
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,730
everybody can look at the code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,350
you can so did everybody and is

103
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,760
everybody who's actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trained</font>

104
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">in security and actually looking for</font>

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,640
security vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> and answer is a</font>

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,410
lot look on<font color="#E5E5E5"> though so the more times</font>

107
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,740
even put into this the better but it

108
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,960
looked it it's a slow process I'm custom

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,550
implementations will always exist to do

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">tanish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements so um there's a bit</font>

111
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,910
of a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasionally is a business</font>

112
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,719
eater and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work cisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to use</font>

113
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:47,340
this young yeah so okay study is

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,800
familiar with sis big IT<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they</font>

115
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,210
make really big Reuters and some

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">security products but mostly did it</font>

117
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,570
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big creatures like court</font>

118
00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:00,150
internet stuff so they have to write

119
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,840
code that does weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with ssl</font>

120
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:07,219
like working out certain routing

121
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,500
absolute tons of traffic based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

122
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">server name indicate sni from ssl so i</font>

123
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,950
have to have some weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> code that didn't</font>

124
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,469
stand that it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hoping to</font>

125
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,800
sell or<font color="#CCCCCC"> libras or whatever they have</font>

126
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,950
their own thing and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes for</font>

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,800
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoints those load balancing all</font>

128
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,820
about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things so there are weird</font>

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,770
implementations shall<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the standard</font>

130
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,200
and you will often find<font color="#E5E5E5"> really odd</font>

131
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,659
behavior in those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

132
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,449
normally expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> never to exist inside an</font>

133
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,599
order so that

134
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,840
um and then of course we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

135
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,520
liking secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite hard cryptography</font>

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,460
is quite complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and writing secure</font>

137
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,159
crypto code is bloody impossible you

138
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,049
could put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team of cryptographers and a</font>

139
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,599
team of developers who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trained in</font>

140
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,689
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and tell them to</font>

141
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,289
write a TLS implementation and you would

142
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:04,270

170
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,370
basically the problem is that we've got

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:15,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">these like layers upon layers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes</font>

173

back with private compatibility which

175
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,300

more code so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just looking for</font>

using bar it's all updated it's great

is not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool</font>

236
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,920
it's just that was a design decision

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,500
that was made which was affected by

238
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,829
third-party library which then in the

239
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,360
end resulted in it not being ideal so

240
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,600
you have to get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old version of</font>

favorite tools because it just works you

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,890
know why it just works because the way

253
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,600
that it scans for SSL is what he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

254
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,939
he went in wireshark made some SSL

255
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,080
connections and then worked out where

256
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,600
the different fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oil that he</font>

258
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,050
dump the entire thing a bit of binary

259
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,640
and then just sends it as a packet so it

260
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,449
doesn't understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> self it just</font>

261
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,060
sends bite and then checks what bites

262
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:24,600
come back also it's written pearl on

264
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,750
a limitation in because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

265
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,000
approach their means that it can't

266
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,640
understand contextual bugs it can't do

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,680
interesting things like what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mess with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the record structure before</font>

269
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,189
it's been encrypted and then send that

270
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,360
encrypted packet it can't do that

271
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,200
because it doesn't understand have to do

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,270
that so for what it was written to do

273
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bloody great job because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Flags them up for particular issues</font>

277
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,370
so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you like a group summary</font>

278
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,830
of these ones are vulnerable the beast

279

and the ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> available to our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thief or</font>

I've contributed a bit too late but I

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:13,779
hate hope so your<font color="#E5E5E5"> next option sort of</font>

283
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:16,629
like going after a fly with a bazooka

284
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,220
oh it's can press so what I'm going to

285
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,389
do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to Nessus license and</font>

286
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,410
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to license</font>

287
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:25,959
because that always work in a vm and now

288
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,600
I've got an appliance on my box running

289
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:31,359
in at the end to scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as well</font>

290
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,370
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> good qualities hug mmm maybe</font>

291
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,170
start on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah a bit of a weird so</font>

292
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,350
if you're already doing networks can

293
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">ensure an SS and koalas are great but at</font>

294
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,759
the end of the day if you're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

295
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:49,149
never be quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

296
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,100
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok i ran the ssl tool against</font>

297
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,189
ssl and i looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results and on</font>

298
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,110
verify them for ourselves so<font color="#CCCCCC"> while if</font>

299
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,759
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing a generic network scan</font>

300
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,529
yeah they're great and they can find

301
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,240
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that it would take it looks</font>

302
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:03,149
to dig out by yourself and you would

303
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,829
probably forget a bunch of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah</font>

304
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:09,639
it's just not a very specific tool is

305
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:16,388
quite bloated for specific person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

306
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:18,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't disparage them not allow this</font>

307
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,309
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is frickin awesome for checking</font>

308
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:24,699
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your server your own server not</font>

309
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:26,439
the client server because it's on the

310
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:28,599
internet and their domain will pop up in

311
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list which is public or you can pick</font>

312
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,029
the box to hide it but I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font>

313
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of all those record you know there's</font>

314
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:41,110
definitely a retention policies that

315
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:43,899
exit which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak eco yeah so as it</font>

316
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,370
allows is awesome if you've never run it

317
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,600
across your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> site if you host your</font>

318
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,889
own site if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never run across that</font>

319
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">run it across it because you can appoint</font>

320
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:55,660
all sorts of interesting from it is

321
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:58,959
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most in-depth ssl testing</font>

322
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,069
call that exists at the moment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

323
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,388
course you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems that you</font>

324
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">can only target things that are on the</font>

325
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:04,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sucking the data</font>

326
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:08,290
centers directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugged into something</font>

327
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:09,579
it ain't worth squat and of course it's

328
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit sketchy to run it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

329
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:13,449
client stuff because then you're

330
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,920
exposing whilst the combination of the

331
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,910
IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you were just from which</font>

332
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,649
is probably registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

333
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,579
organization which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not too</font>

334
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,459
difficult to work happens your

335
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,109
apprentice org directed to the client

336
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,000
domain and then you can sort of tie

337
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,430
those two together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go oh look you</font>

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,110
know who printer so

339
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:35,109
bit sketchy but still a cool cool I wish

340
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshot physical so the</font>

341
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,140
summary is some tools have technical

342
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:42,730
gotchas so like SL scam they can just

343
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">silently not do things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to do some calls the hard</font>

345
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,720
to expand of course so fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> we enum it's</font>

346
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,209
written in a way that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it quite</font>

347
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,560
specific to its original goal very

348
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:57,640
difficult to expand the detection of

349
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,969
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of bloated in terms of this</font>

350
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,089
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I'm some sort of convictions on</font>

to maintain pearl because nobody can

look that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> previous speaker use this</font>

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:30,040
rule there is an XKCD for everything and

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's usually this one so of course I'm</font>

360
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,010
tools let's write another one so we've

361
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,230
got competing competing but I think

362
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,400
that's a good things at all because as

363
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,260
long as those tools are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used to</font>

364
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security stuff the mortals</font>

365
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,020
you've got the more likely it is that

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:51,040
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find something interesting it's</font>

367
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:57,310
called to expand your horizon so the

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">goals of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool that i wrote is yes</font>

369
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,359
going for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that s how much</font>

370
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,179
does was much sort of initial idea i

371
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,170
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like can I get ssl lab not pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

372
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,339
quality because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is a monster</font>

373
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,559
can I get everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that s still</font>

374
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,389
lobsters and put it in a command line

375
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,879
tools that you just fire and then it

376
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,199
gives you a bunch of data happy it I

377
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,270
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> also like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be</font>

378
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,329
cross-platform because i'm a dirty even

379
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,709
and i use windows as my testing platform

380
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:25,899
but we've got people who use our sex

381
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,030
we've got people who use all sorts of

382
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:33,870
flavors of limits we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a guy who</font>

385
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">funnier because he's a debian maintainer</font>

386
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,590
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would also like it not to</font>

387
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,300
sonic leaf<font color="#CCCCCC"> a-list assistant not set up</font>

388
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,929
properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so of course the back on that</font>

389
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,340
sslc an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have to rely on</font>

390
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,080
compiling things because i hate

391
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,699
compiling things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course as soon</font>

392
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,919
as you have to compile something it

393
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly become surprisingly not cross</font>

394

platform like oh yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> compile that</font>

395
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,170
it'll work yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay after that six</font>

396
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,760
hours is working out white GCC is

397
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,080
outputting this particular failure you

398
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,340
see my little windows motion coming up

399
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,310
no reliance on magic packet because

400
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:31,780
again that's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

401
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:34,000
approach to be much more built into a

402
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,860
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation so that it can</font>

403
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,230
really understand the contextual issues

404
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:44,919
are available to sort of pull data from

405
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,330
nice easy to maintain and expand so sort

406
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
of needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to some reasonable</font>

407
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:53,250
development processes which are no we're

408
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,510
also fantastic asses security people and

409
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,430
yeah output documents not in a fixed

410
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,530
format because everybody has their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

411
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,360
import modules for whatever report

412
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,010
they're doing whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're tasting it</font>

413
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,500
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word document like it's the stone</font>

414
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,180
age or whether they've got their own

415
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,170
magic report software that they've got

416
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:13,240
XML or JSON or whatever imports from so

417
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,160
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some sort of</font>

418
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,230
output module that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a report</font>

419
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,690
object and then transform<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to HTML</font>

420
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,610
page you're just some<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML or whatever</font>

421
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,620
and then import it or just use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

422
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,729
report or whatever you like or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

423
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,580
text um and then of course easy for an

424
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,500
on deck to contribute so one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

425
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,790
problems is that there's so many damn

426
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,440
ssl bugs that come out and I kind of go

427
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,899
all right right well I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

428
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,400
build a check for that but there's makes

429
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,170
it seem cool so I'd love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stick</font>

430
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
it in Ethel's everybody can use it and

431
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,850
then you spend two hours trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,580
out how the

433
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little work so in this case I want it</font>

434
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be let's say this particular cycle</font>

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,460
sweet or these sets last week<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

436
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,170
constitute a particular vulnerability

437
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,790
because we discovered something about

438
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:04,070
whatever AAS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 was that like for</font>

439
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,570
example the article case we've been all

440
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,189
got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our c4 is actually quite crap</font>

441
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,490
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to report that you're</font>

442
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,190
using us before can we make it easy for

443
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,650
an undead just to go oh all i have to do

444
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">is say our default is bad and basically</font>

445
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,450
copy paste a line in and it goes up yeah

446
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now i can detect that that would be</font>

447
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:28,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite nice so the solution my problem</font>

448
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,270
was awesome but more specifically tell

449
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,429
us like so tlf light is a pure poison

450
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:39,350
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiele it also does a</font>

451
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:41,600
cell b3 it sound easy to understand

452
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,929
because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> python</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and b it was written by</font>

453
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,340
somebody who's actually fairly competent

454
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,780
it's got minimal dependencies there's

455
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a couple of critical dependencies</font>

456
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,410
that it won't win without but it would

457
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,360
very much complain which is it doesn't

458
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,460
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> barking they're like Python hit</font>

459
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,010
install whatever the name of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so</font>

460
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,870
it's dead easy to get in there's a

461
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,430
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more complicated dependencies</font>

462
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,679
but the more complicated tendencies are

463
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,630
literally just things like you can

464
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,590
install a library which makes the RFA

465
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,450
much faster without it it's the work so

466
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a nice to have so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

467
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,740
nice it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> on linux OS x and windows</font>

468
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,360
so that's dead easy as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well because it's</font>

469
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,360
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> python it's all to pull in from any</font>

470
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,129
specific libraries it's written<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a guy</font>

471
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,959
called Trevor<font color="#E5E5E5"> karen and that's some</font>

472
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,140
additional contributions from others and

473
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:31,580
there's an URL providers and then a

474
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:34,880
while back Trevor created tell a slight

475
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,530
mg which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York the older</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one was</font>

476
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,460
on the different license and then they

477
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:42,170
ported it cross onto a new license

478
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,600
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> d now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintained version of it</font>

479
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it was sort of report from</font>

480
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get is</font>

481
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:55,189
create together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a connection with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

482
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:57,170
they go so you import socket and tell us

483
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,470
like because of course itself sits on

484
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">top or chalices on top of ATP</font>

485
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,730
or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> GDPs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on kids that participate</font>

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon on par</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and then</font>

487
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,530
just literally rack TLS connection on

488
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> market and it's what and then of</font>

489
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,760
course because it's like an open source

490
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,789
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess with those with that</font>

491
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,760
satellite library so that instead of

492
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the things that the telus protocol</font>

493
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,720
expects you to do you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

494
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">else or you can tap into data at</font>

495
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular point yeah just between</font>

496
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,049
whether triple dot is you literally just

497
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">right to the corner object and not gonna</font>

498
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:42,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">go that way okay so the initial features</font>

499
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to start with was obviously</font>

500
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,039
slice of sweet detection because that's

501
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,169
what all the tools do in this just where

502
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,049
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of based off but also</font>

503
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,600
include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telex v 1.3 draft spec</font>

504
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:56,840
because that come out literally as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

505
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">start writing it and also detect unknown</font>

506
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,480
sweets because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out that there's</font>

507
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,150
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of server implementations will</font>

508
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,530
just accept at least initially because

509
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,880
you don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to it but it</font>

510
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:13,549
will accept cipher suites that are

511
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,210
specified by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TLS spec like they</font>

512
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:21,080
don't exist so that's weird so they're

513
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,070
like proprietary starts this week as far

514
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,110
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware there aren't really any</font>

515
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,610
tools that look for that at the moment

516
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,240
apart from what's the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

517
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,908
scanners and also look for supported

518
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,309
curves when elliptic<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suites are</font>

519
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,130
enabled that's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick win</font>

520
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,080
because it's dead easy to detect them

521
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,669
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally the same sort of</font>

522
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,649
functionality is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing normal /</font>

523
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,179
sweet detection you just advertise a

524
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular curve and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

525
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:50,000
try each one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know which one</font>

526
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was supporting them are supported also</font>

527
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,010
looking for CLS extensions and feature

528
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:57,260
detection so LPN and in the end they're

529
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,730
not strictly security features for their

530
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:06,020
interesting call the previous privacy

531
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:08,330
aspect and the scfv downgrade attack

532
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,730
prevention stuff is quite interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

533
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,280
look for as well and then implementation

534
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,360
checks so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for server random</font>

535
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,190
entropy

536
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,340
and Max<font color="#E5E5E5"> record validation and these</font>

537
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,330
bottoms who were both born out of

538
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:27,230
interesting things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found on</font>

539
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:28,939
tests or in interactions deployment and

540
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,620
i should say those things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found</font>

541
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:37,090
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> interactions reply when we work on</font>

542
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:40,489
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not michael anthony so</font>

543
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,290
first intersection is fairly easy but

544
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,740
for each of the protocols in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

545
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:50,540
try each slide suite number from 0 0 0 0

546
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,940
ffs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just extend it identifies and</font>

547
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,020
basically just you send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client hello</font>

548
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,490
and say oh I support this one fighter

549
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,250
that's all I support and then it says

550
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then you know it supports it if it</font>

551
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,950
goes oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what that is and</font>

552
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure a place to look Plato a look then</font>

553
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it doesn't support it and then</font>

554
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,360
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your list of known</font>

555
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,770
ones that are real so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can map the</font>

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and if they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not in that list you</font>

557
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,710
know they support something<font color="#E5E5E5"> funky so you</font>

558
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,229
store the accepted combination and then

559
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,720
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each accepted one weather where you</font>

560
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:31,310
know that the size of sweets is elliptic

561
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:35,690
curve like HT th you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHE that kind</font>

562
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:39,740
of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you then just free to curb ID</font>

563
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,300
go round<font color="#E5E5E5"> around again and try connecting</font>

564
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,630
and just report that being the only one

565
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:49,010
that's the person and then you saw so

566
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:51,680
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy so next protocol</font>

567
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,110
negotiation was a specification that was

568
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:59,320
adopted<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite quickly but it was never</font>

569
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:03,290
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like properly accepted by the ITF</font>

570
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:07,669
and they defecated it really quickly but

571
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:11,510
the idea is that so with the birth of

572
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:13,610
HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> too if you wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a TLS</font>

573
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,220
connection because all about the general

574
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">rule is that all at HTTP two is over LF</font>

575
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:23,420
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you go to make a connection</font>

576
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:26,120
so you do the client hello server hello

577
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,740
back you yeah your handshake and then

578
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,969
you start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

579
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,510
you go oh by the way I'd like to speak

580
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,559
HTTP two and then it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> are great now</font>

581
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,090
you've got to drop that connection

582
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,920
create a new connection over HTTP two

583
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,280
and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another round</font>

584
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,230
trip so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a round in order to stop</font>

585
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,240
this round trip this second round trip

586
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:50,570
and speed up the latency of connection

587
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,690
instead what happens is you can say you

588
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,399
can indicate inside the TLS handshake

589
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,200
that you would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak a</font>

590
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,990
particular protocol that's not a very

591
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,840
strict you can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> both in that if you</font>

592
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,360
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but in general you could</font>

593
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,740
say something like HTTP two and then it

594
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,409
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go oh actually I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you're</font>

595
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and pull HTTP two to me so</font>

596
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,790
the application layer can then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I'm</font>

597
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and speak that soon as you</font>

598
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,720
can through and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to drop</font>

599
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,340
the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and create a little one</font>

600
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,750
so detection collapse that easy you

601
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,379
connect the server using any TLS

602
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,220
protocol you advertise the NBN

603
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,340
functionality as popular Taylor

604
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">expansion and then you check the cervelo</font>

605
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,370
heart and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> PM response in it if it</font>

606
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it doesn't support</font>

607
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:38,989
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then they replace it with this LPN</font>

608
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,139
oh sorry I'm this one thing ah was a

609
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:45,860
privacy concern because you're saying I

610
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:48,470
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak HTTP to you can tell</font>

611
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that that extension is</font>

612
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,850
sent in the client hello it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

613
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,320
clear so you so if somebody's looking at

614
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,600
that they can go oh well I know that

615
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,790
that connection was a HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

616
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,740
connection rather than I just know it

617
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,690
together anything you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

618
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">us because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can put arbitrary binary</font>

619
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,980
through that it's not generally a

620
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,520
massive concern for most people but it

621
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:16,370
is a consensus or there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are issues with</font>

622
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,960
doing that through tall so I OPN is the

623
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,469
newest back which is actually

624
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,940
implemented now and they got rid of NPN

625
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:29,270
but you will still find services support

626
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:34,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> PN so again same thing same deal</font>

627
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:39,168
really you've got the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> broski</font>

628
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:42,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">concern not actually even edit that no I</font>

629
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:45,020
did not yeah it's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same the</font>

630
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,760
difference the difference was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTN</font>

631
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:51,379
was weird because it required an

632
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:53,540
additional message type in TLS which is

633
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,100
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like people not to</font>

634
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,360
do in their specs which is I think

635
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,719
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the reasons they got rid</font>

636
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,050
of it an LPN works just as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> teller</font>

637
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">extension so they went mm maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

638
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,510
switch legs<font color="#CCCCCC"> rayon it's exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

639
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:13,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically are the detection is</font>

640
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:17,080
slightly different because LPN protocols

641
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:22,250
when a particular a LPN protocol is

642
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:25,340
accepted it will only put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LPN</font>

643
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,530
extension back in the server hello if

644
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,809
you match up the correct LPN protocol

645
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,280
that is expecting to see so the TLS

646
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,740
implementation might actually support<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

647
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,260
LPN but you can't tell that unless you

648
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,330
work out which pro which I also in the

649
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,610
next protocols like HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

650
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,168
but it actually support so if you don't

651
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the right one you'll miss the</font>

652
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,590
detection so it's a little bit harder to

653
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">check but the great thing about this is</font>

654
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:52,309
that there's a bunch of draft identifies

655
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:54,410
which are like like H a hyphen and then

656
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:56,120
two numbers and there's about 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

657
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,490
so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just come through all of</font>

658
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,209
those most TLS implementations actually

659
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,700
include those as like just defaults so

660
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,630
you can spot them fairly quickly will

661
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:11,330
you go so an actual security thing to

662
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,860
detect well as anticipo if you want tell

663
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:20,090
us for back signaling probably six weeks

664
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:21,830
value sese so visit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure some of you</font>

665
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,709
are familiar with sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> taylor</font>

666
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:28,100
downgrade attacks that i'll learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

667
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,600
go to a basic way of how I work so Alex

668
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,149
attempts to connect to Bob server with

669
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,850
cl actually 1.2 so alice is like yes

670
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:38,570
I've got it up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> date client and I can</font>

671
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,760
talk TLS 1.2 but ease man in the middle

672
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">calm own go actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to</font>

673
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:47,330
send back actually we go support<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Bob</font>

674
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,800
server doesn't support that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice's</font>

675
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,449
bro

676
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:55,060
go Oh TLS 1.2<font color="#CCCCCC"> II wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supported okay</font>

677
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,220
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just try to LS 1.1 because that the</font>

678
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,440
standard like<font color="#CCCCCC"> downgrade and reconnect</font>

679
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,030
approach that most browsers do because

680
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously otherwise you would only ever</font>

681
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,770
would only be able to connect over tell

682
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,350
us 1.8 and anything else which is

683
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely fail so it tries again with</font>

684
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">telus 1.1 and it says you can just mind</font>

685
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,170
in the middle back in and just keep

686
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:24,280
going keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going until the</font>

687
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:26,080
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of the protocol versions</font>

688
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,510
that are supported by the downgrade

689
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,560
approach from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser so eventually</font>

690
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,240
you can end up on something like

691
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:36,550
there'll be three or flv to surrender

692
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Bob server access / XLV three</font>

693
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,980
connection and then Eve exports it using

694
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:46,389
some of the book which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not good so to</font>

695
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:50,580
stop this we got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sts-v thing ah so</font>

696
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:53,170
what happens with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> FC FC extension is</font>

697
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,199
the initial connection is the same so

698
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:59,170
Alice tries to talk swap server tries

699
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,000
the TLS 1.2<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eve man in the middle of</font>

701
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">supported Alice's browser then goes oh</font>

702
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:10,240

00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:42,460
part of that the advertised maximum

713
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,610
much oh sorry so it turns it assists the

flash we as part of it and then dog

716
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,500
server goes oh cool um your front of

717
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,750
downgrade sir pls v 1.1 but then

718
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,899
observing a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> i support tell etsy</font>

720
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:05,008
for 1.1 so it goes oh well this must be

721
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:08,519
an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> for exhaust connection as</font>

722
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:10,129
we're all so close it the fatal up so

723
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,149
that way you can't just a

724
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:14,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle it and pretend like</font>

00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:16,738
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection didn't work it just it</font>

726
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,259
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know that the downgrade</font>

attack was eluted and key back off and

728
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,200
for those of you wondering what you

729
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,539
can't just temple with the second packet

730
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:33,509
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming through and remove the</font>

00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,830
the handshake our hash together on both

733
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,039
sides and then the values are compared

734
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,869
after the key exchange so even if you

735
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,999
tampered with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as their</font>

736
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:46,559

00:33:51,809 --> 00:34:00,359
favorite things about Taylor sorry

741
00:33:53,789 --> 00:34:03,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">warning on detecting it yeah it's very</font>

742
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,689
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make a substandard connection</font>

743
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:10,168

max<font color="#CCCCCC"> els version that was given and then</font>

745
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:15,270
you connect again supply a lower pls

746
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,349
version and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the SS v / sweet so</font>

747
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:21,750
you're basically emulating what both

<font color="#CCCCCC">allison bees are doing and then if you</font>

Ashley exactly supporters if the

751
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,719
connection is allowed it either means

752
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:32,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scfv isn't recognized by the server</font>

753
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,980
it's not support it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's implemented</font>

754
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:41,279
so horribly that it just simply doesn't

755
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:43,889
work cool so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing is shut</font>

756
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:46,949
around them so so everyone's really

757
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:50,520
important so when you make a connection

758
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:52,828
to NLCS server are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send point hello</font>

759
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,139
and my client<font color="#CCCCCC"> hello contains</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Cloyd</font>

760
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:57,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">render and then the server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> response back</font>

761
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:01,309
the silver hello max payne 2 server<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

762
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:04,890
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that both sides of the</font>

763
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:07,650
connection are supplying random data

764
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:11,279
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then used with a pseudo-random</font>

765
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,559
function of TRS combined with the

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,339
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac secret for that for that</font>

769
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:24,660
particular connection now if you only

770
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:28,799
use I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sketch way round</font>

771
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,859
it is if you only use one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them client</font>

772
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:34,589
or server IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> at which one is it 45 you</font>

773
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,540
can just replay the handshake because

774
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,680
there's no additional random data<font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font>

775
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,200
a lot more slides you eejit be able to

776
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,470
repay<font color="#E5E5E5"> handshakes over and over again and</font>

777
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,839
make connections at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point which is</font>

778
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,509
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it um so Paul randomness</font>

779
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,460
server and them can reduce security

780
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,559
significantly because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can predict</font>

781
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,700
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> runnin and you've either got the</font>

782
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:59,160
potential potential to<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the replay</font>

783
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,319
attacks or you've got the potential to

784
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,259
maybe brute force<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever remaining</font>

785
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:07,230
randomness was actually depending on the

786
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,230
implementation it yeah it's like if

787
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:12,750
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reducing you to be open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

788
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:16,500
of course repeating server random values

789
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:19,200
cannot allow for replay back so testing

790
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,730
randomness properly is hard if anybody

791
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,490
has ever come across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> die-hard</font>

792
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,740
randomness sweet and try to work out how

793
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,689
the hell that works and what the hell

794
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,089
the results out of it mean you'll

795
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,150
probably start to get into the realm of

796
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:36,710
like probability theorem and yeah also

797
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:39,990
the number theory and things just get

798
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:43,049
yeah whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the guy</font>

799
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:48,118
with the explosion<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind is loan that</font>

800
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:50,670
kind of thing um yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing</font>

801
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,760
randomness and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need gigs of data and</font>

802
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:56,099
if your server random values are only a

803
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,270
few tens of bytes in each response how

804
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,809
many connections are you going to have

805
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:02,609
to make to get enough data there's like

806
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:04,230
so doing actual testing like that is

807
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,630
really difficult so instead you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

808
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,730
some heuristics so the first one is

809
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,920
repetition checking so if you connect to

810
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the server a bunch of time and if any of</font>

811
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,690
those give you the same random value

812
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:18,029
twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pretty good indicator that</font>

813
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,470
something's very broken and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

814
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,510
was a repetition they knew what the

815
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,970
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys on</font>

816
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,880
the hand check our compression testing

817
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,129
get a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data try to compress it</font>

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,309
it's highly improper then it won't

819
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,869
compress much or at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not very</font>

820
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">entropic and it will compress quite</font>

821
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:38,069
easily that's a dead simple way to check

822
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether something actually like properly</font>

823
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:46,470
statistically random and it requires

824
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:48,269
nothing but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> set lib you can take</font>

825
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">the arithmetic mean which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like the</font>

826
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:54,328
crudest possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> neck measure put it</font>

827
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,130
detection sort of numeric skew serial

828
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:59,279
correlation which is essentially between

829
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:03,450
each bite how many bits change like

830
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:04,680
which bits slip and there's a statistic

831
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,689
elaborate of what you would expect the

832
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,098
Roman data for that and then mono bit

833
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,400
frequencies are basically how many times

834
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,410
you see a one how many home uses there

835
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,849
so if that's roughly about right and you

836
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:19,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's fairly good it's vandalism</font>

837
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:22,289
education some of those will pass if you

838
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:25,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java's math.random through</font>

839
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:26,789
it some of those will not which is good

840
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:30,328
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's</font>

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:58,259
back will I sorry so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

850
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,000
got the tool test for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is likely it</font>

851
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:01,769
does a bunch of connections I think like

852
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,430
10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> by default but you can change it</font>

853
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:07,979
like a man dies like aggregate all of

854
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,960
that data together into one<font color="#CCCCCC"> big quandary</font>

855
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,970
blob and then runs all of those pests

856
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,099
across so it tries to compress all that

857
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:18,410
data if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> repetitions or</font>

858
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,539
anything like that whereas detecting

859
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:24,359
repetitions in whole responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

860
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:27,180
easy detecting repetition between

861
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:29,759
responses can be more more difficult so

862
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know ever any of you</font>

863
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:35,160
remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debian ssl certificate</font>

864
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:39,079
generation blog where instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> random</font>

865
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,078
data they use stuff from the stack

866
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:46,380
all good but it looks fairly random so

867
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:48,959
you know footage of pointers so the

868
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:52,890
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erica facts or the things appear</font>

869
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,750
it may may look kinda random but when

870
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,009
you really actually compress it down you

871
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,630
go actually that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was run under the</font>

872
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,130
cultic levels and this was the check

873
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:03,090
checks once you've got a big block in

874
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,290
danger it would quite well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes I know</font>

875
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,380
it's over and the repetition is

876
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:11,100
surprisingly common they're scared me

877
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it so I forget what it was</font>

878
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,750
and some random server load balancer or

879
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,160
something and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our guys is doing a</font>

880
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:23,490
web app test he just happened to put the

881
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,750
ball run across it and he got some day

882
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,939
throughout the server and the man went

883
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,670
doesn't look very random and kept

884
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,050
running it and refreshing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes what</font>

885
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,970
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting the same values out of it</font>

886
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:36,150
and it turns out that what it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

887
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:38,759
is it had a global random value for the

888
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,800
server random which changed every second

889
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,270
so if you make more than one connection

890
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:49,620
within a second they all get the same

891
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:51,960
server running winter fishing yeah it's

892
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,390
a bit weird so yeah we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

893
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,870
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch if you start</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">digging around cve and also like</font>

00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:11,420

899
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:18,960
so Mac bit validation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one so</font>

900
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I was saying earlier I was hoping</font>

901
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in TLS 1.3 that we would have</font>

902
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,200
finally fixed one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-running</font>

903
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,290
sort of weaknesses in the protocol in

904
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,890
terms of the ways it quits how it's done

905

<font color="#CCCCCC">maclennan Creek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MacLennan crip means</font>

906
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:40,710
that when you take your plain text you

907
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:44,940
then compute your message authentication

908
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:47,400
code your Mac your signature you can

909
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,690
creat that over the plain tap you should

910
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,300
stick Mac Mac record on the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

911
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,550
plain text or the Oracle wherever and

912
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,740
then

913
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:58,660
that produces a record and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that entire</font>

914
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:04,180
record is then encrypted now I would say

915
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:08,890
something like three or four of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

916
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:11,649
major ssl/tls books that were out were

917
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:18,089
due to padding Oracle or other Oracle

918
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:22,900
attacks against cbc-mac shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there</font>

919
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Macklin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CBC has implemented in TNA due</font>

920
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,740
to that due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

921
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:33,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">memory and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that because</font>

922
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:38,430
you have to decrypt the message to get

923
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:40,960
to the message authentication code any

924
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:44,169
discrepancy in how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is decrypted</font>

925
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,670
leads leads to a side channel that you

926
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use to determine something about the</font>

927
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:52,780
plain text so for example beef<font color="#CCCCCC"> was based</font>

928
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,830
format so yeah you can use that the

929
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,570
padding Oracle it's about that on it

930
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:01,750
kinda<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a much trickery can be done</font>

931
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:04,840
but this gets way worse if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

932
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,700
check the max properly because the

933
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,590
padding Oracle's require all sorts of

934
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,569
clever foo and if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

935
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,310
like the requirement some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

936
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:16,230
like oh yeah if you make 14 billion

937
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,520
connections you're like yeah okay like

938
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,140
maybe if you're more I botnet you can

939
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,480
make 14 million connections and do this

940
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:29,170
attack but it's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> d-don't so yeah</font>

941
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,270
yeah but then if you can find out that

942
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Mac isn't properly validated or just</font>

943
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,390
not validate an assault you can just

944
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:38,290
arbitrarily start forging Taylor socket

945
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,549
which is great how they're actually

946
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:45,090
known here that's implementation books

947
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:47,470
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> max</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not validated properly so</font>

948
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:50,680
check into this is a brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force</font>

949
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:54,819
approach so in Taylor v 1.1 the verify

950
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,560
data field was fixed at 12 like the 96

951
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:00,040
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so your max for each packet with</font>

952
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,770
always notice expect if the mac type in

953
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,960
use was shorter than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were just</font>

954
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">had it</font>

955
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,630
inhale<font color="#CCCCCC"> SB 1.2 and later they change that</font>

956
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,310
so it's a each side street that was

957
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,500
defined previously has a 12 opposite

958
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,690
value new<font color="#E5E5E5"> site of sweets can now</font>

959
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,640
overwrite that so for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

960
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:24,750
say like you've now got a such a sweet

961
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:27,460
with sha-256 at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> per packet mac and</font>

962
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:32,740
then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have like a full 256</font>

963
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:34,780
it Mac per packet or why so for each of

964
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,629
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bits in the mac so let's</font>

965
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,640
say 96 for the default the open

966
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,040
connection and you complete the TLS

967
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,348
handshake and then what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you</font>

968
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:49,480
compute a mask<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a bitwise max value of</font>

969
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:51,190
one shifted left by whatever number

970
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,859
whatever bit number you're currently on

971
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:55,960
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're saying is start</font>

972
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:58,750
off with a bit on the far<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-hand</font>

973
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,130
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 96 bits in this bit string and</font>

974
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,480
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to go to</font>

975
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next bit and the next bits and</font>

976
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,040
experts next bit just just one bit each

977
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:07,390
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going to generate a</font>

978
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,140
single packet and send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

979
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:14,080
together exit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> verify data part</font>

980
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,879
before the crypto so that verify data

981
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,029
field inside that tier left packet

982
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,960
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip that one bit you're</font>

983
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,190
going to X or that mask with it so of

984
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,440
course what you've done is you've caused

985
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,970
that one bit to no longer be correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

986
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the bits of that verify data</font>

987
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:33,848
are correct that one bit is incorrect

<font color="#E5E5E5">and if the immediate response back is</font>

broken because you know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

992
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,500
forge that one bit and it still says oh

993
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:50,279
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine so not very common that</font>

994
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,440
you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen because most</font>

995
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,820
most implementations that don't have

996
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,440
problems with us but historically there

997
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,980
are actually quite a few books around

998
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,470
this for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most one case when</font>

999
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,270
only the first bike was actually checked

1000
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:07,020
so you can only have children you have

1001
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,040
256 possible values<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the entire map</font>

1002
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,700
which of course if you know what the

1003
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,290
market expects to be is your because

1004
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,939
it's on the plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> pet so you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1005
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,940
known plaintext you can then

1006
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:25,460
compute another<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac such that the same</font>

1007
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:30,180
our first<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same and then just</font>

1008
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:32,309
replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so that one um so yeah</font>

1009
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,200
so that's really fairly simple to check

1010
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:35,880
in terms of you've only<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to do 96</font>

1011
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,769
connections in order to check that all

1012
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,970
of these are actually going and of

1013
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:41,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">course this gets a little bit more</font>

1014
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:44,160
complicated in TLS 1.2 because then

1015
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:47,579
you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check based on the</font>

1016
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:51,359
particular site for how long that is so

1017
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:54,930
a good trick of that is pick any

1018
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,480
arbitrary TLS v 1.1 or before / sweet

1019
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,598
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that then pick your shortest</font>

1020
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:06,779
and your longest lxv 1.2 cipher suites

1021
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:08,160
that specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overridden length and</font>

1022
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:13,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you're going to cover most of</font>

1023
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:16,109
you look so yes they're really all look

1024
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:20,069
like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tools actually</font>

1025
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:25,200
inspired by one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might discuss it in a</font>

1026
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute I know I'm running fairly closed</font>

1027
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,960
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> result is a tool called ssl x-ray</font>

1028
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:34,379
it had another name before it was called

1029
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">st CA you nobody could remember it so</font>

1030
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,880
it's now Lester select right so it's a

1031
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,890
more modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> tattle-tale ask ina it's</font>

1032
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,180
really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model cutters got a</font>

1033
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:47,160
modified version is hella like library

1034
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,538
so it's been an internal alpha / peter

1035
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,670
and i say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically what that means</font>

1036
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,470
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote it it went into our internal</font>

1037
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:54,599
repo and some people use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1038
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:57,930
didn't and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> every so often somebody</font>

1039
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,339
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that fool you go so it's not</font>

1040
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,618
yet been published into the world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1041
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:03,119
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got in last week I</font>

1042
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">was hoping to really polish it off and</font>

1043
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,140
do some additional research with it and

1044
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:10,049
make this more interesting but I'm

1045
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,819
working on it so follow me on twitter or

1046
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:13,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and i'll tweet when it's ready</font>

1047
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure somebody if you don't</font>

1048
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:18,380
follow me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter somebody else might</font>

1049
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:21,930
find it and then pop it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know ah</font>

1050
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:25,200
the future so what I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

1051
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:27,299
our proper XLV to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> Taylor slice</font>

1052
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,109
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> natively support ssl v2 because</font>

1053
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:33,480
it's old and it's all but because it you

1054
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,130
is a completely different packet format

1055
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,599
this is that from like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Netscape</font>

1056
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Navigator days is older he'll probably</font>

1057
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:46,589
older than me yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hacking that</font>

1058
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:49,859
support in myself client certificates

1059
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:51,808
court yet need to add that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I'm</font>

1060
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:54,390
aware at the moment there are no

1061
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:55,769
standalone Taylor so I / sweet checking

1062
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:59,160
tools that support client certificates

1063
00:48:55,769 --> 00:49:03,808
as far as I'm aware so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1064
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:06,480
nice extending the maximization stuff to

1065
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:07,950
padding bits as well because planning

1066
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,269
validation of course is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important</font>

1067
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:14,669
as well x509 if you get passing so

1068
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:18,058
basically whenever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak server look</font>

1069
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:20,640
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate giving back pop</font>

1070
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:24,059
out book in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like SL lab does like</font>

1071
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,140
quite a few little do and of course also

1072
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:29,579
look for broken back and knowing week

1073
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:32,339
certificates so like I mentioned the

1074
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">Debian certificate generation book there</font>

1075
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:40,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a few others as well for example</font>

1076
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:42,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">king and RSA modulus is like three it's</font>

1077
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:49,910
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> short small modules it causes</font>

1078
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:53,940
causes problems so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suppose chain so</font>

1079
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:56,788
when you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server responds with a</font>

1080
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,089
SL can actually respond with two

1081
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:02,220
separate validation chains some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1082
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:03,569
can include like old outdated certs and

1083
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,618
stuff is just not good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and of</font>

1084
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:06,329
course and you've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem but if</font>

1085
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:11,119
you pop either a GoSee age you can now

1086
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:14,640
cross issue even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't pin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1087
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,369
export great export<font color="#CCCCCC"> grade D H so like</font>

1088
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,460
log jam framework common ECG<font color="#CCCCCC"> HQ</font>

1089
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:23,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">detection as well support for DSA</font>

1090
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,609
certificates first like six people who

1091
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:28,650
use those and saving scam traffic to pee

1092
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:32,279
cash because at the moment nobody seems

1093
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this as a tall and in some cases</font>

1094
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,660
clients will say can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> store pee caps</font>

1095
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,819
of everything you do and be quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

1096
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,259
to be able to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just try a</font>

1097
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,980
little rock pick out and that way your

1098
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:47,250
filter written

1099
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:59,470
yeah the pain how am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got five minutes</font>

1100
00:50:47,250 --> 00:51:00,640
okay that's a lie ok so the inspiration

1101
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:04,810
for this tool actually came from a

1102
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,940
really interesting case that we had with

1103
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:08,320
somebody who's no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a climb not</font>

1104
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,760
because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because we got</font>

1105
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,590
bought by disco is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> crash the</font>

1106
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,080
loyal clients and designers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Osaka</font>

1107
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:21,760
bargain<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um vulnerability scanners</font>

1108
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:26,460
are not able to politics so lsv large

1109
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:28,930
scanner vendor versus an f5 TLS look so

1110
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:34,330
f I've had this chalice blog which they

1111
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:36,040
called soul 69 70 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lori Google TLS</font>

1112

client<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished message validation</font>

1113
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,790
vulnerability so basically there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

1114
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:42,180
issue with the finish message not having

00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:47,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">it Mac validated or something like that</font>

1116
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:50,350
which are came up in a scam and it

1117
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:53,830
didn't go well so the large-scale a

1118

vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Texas obscure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blog in a PCI DSS</font>

00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were scamming sells its PCI DSS</font>

1121
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:08,590
because of it I'm the org<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

1122
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,940
massively happy because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

1123
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:15,460
they're like why one doesn't that mean

1124
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:20,590
that everybody that uses X I stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> sales</font>

1125
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:22,840
there PTI when we go oh maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't</font>

1126
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,280
surprise me it also wouldn't surprise me

1127
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:29,770
if most people just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1128
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:31,600
for college let know so the organization

00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:41,710
that it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so less than 24</font>

1133
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,380
hours go by and the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

1134
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:47,020
back and said for this large gonna

vendor they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just now issued a</font>

clarification this is a false positive

on all f type system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exact</font>

successful pci exception

1139
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:59,510
and I read the bulletin and I go kind of

1140
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">light on details and it very</font>

1141
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,700
specifically worded<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards pci and very</font>

1142
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,050
conveniently time so I google the name

1143
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,919
of a guy who wrote the bulletin and he

1144
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:12,800
used to work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization and my</font>

1145
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,420
 me to go through 11 so if this

1146
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,460
tool sort of came off the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1147
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,010
going hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to check whether</font>

1148
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:22,850
this look like actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists because I</font>

1149
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of culture dish scanner vendor</font>

1150
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:27,080
because clearly this conflict of

1151
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:31,220
interest and the timing was amazingly

1152
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:33,529
cuz coincidental particularly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1153
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:38,290
was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone with the person as they</font>

1154
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:42,410
were reading that exact forum yeah

1155
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:44,029
anyway so the actual end I promise there

1156
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,040
isn't that this isn't a lie and that

1157
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:48,490
there isn't more slides after this and

1158
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:57,710
i'll let you go get there or whatever

1159
00:53:48,490 --> 00:54:07,640
anybody question we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic man to</font>

1160
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:11,660
another sorry I that you were talking

1161
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,069
about sure the room randomness does any

1162
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,899
of that work that you've done with the

1163
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:17,480
tool based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that came in</font>

1164
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:19,550
after black hat last year there were two

1165
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,430
guys as American research in the garden

1166
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Germany and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the they talked about am a</font>

theoretical attacking line against TLS

1168
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:33,260
1.2 the gym and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually written a</font>

1169
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,910
tool to scan server responses it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1170
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,990
interesting to see how some<font color="#CCCCCC"> randomness</font>

1171
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">came back as all zeros 10 I think I</font>

1172
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:43,879
don't think we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

1173
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,740
the black 4 2016<font color="#CCCCCC"> book is quite</font>

1174
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:49,420
interesting excellent oh well yeah I

1175
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:55,029
love a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture up anybody else Oh</font>

1176
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:58,910
pull it off gonna make you run cardiac

1177
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:01,250
so you mentioned with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the singing cited</font>

1178
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:04,220
feed value that to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was</font>

1179
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:07,280
no tampering of this downgraded Dyke

1180
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,930
flag those be hashing on both sides

1181
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,450
right yeah yeah

1182
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,419
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't that work which is ensuring</font>

1183
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,529
that there was no downgrade attempted

1184
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,869
like white because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your vote because</font>

1185
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:19,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're just dropping the packet so on</font>

1186
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:21,050
the first connection you just completely

1187
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:23,000
drop the packet and kill the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

1188
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,640
so that the server never even sees that

1189
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,200
first request so because you're dropping

1190
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,410
it in the first connection the browser

1191
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:33,319
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that failed I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1192
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,180
now try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect again with a lower</font>

1193
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:36,558
protocol version to say about what see

1194
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,828
if that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like a bass</font>

1195
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:42,849
compatibility issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you just</font>

1196
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:46,550
completely drop that first connection

1197
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:47,750
there's no room for like tampering

1198
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:57,680
because it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter you just</font>

1199
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:59,960
dropped it completely when you were

1200
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,118
seeing about and angry invitation one of

1201
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,530
the bushings being harsh off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket</font>

1202
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then and then after the key</font>

1203
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:10,130
exchange communicate how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ensure</font>

1204
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,960
that the two hashes are shared out of

1205
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,760
the key exchange securely because surely

1206
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,960
theoretically if you can break the

1207
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,299
connection quickly enough you can then

1208
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:22,839
intercept the communication of the two

1209
00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:26,809
hash values to be correct right I

1210
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,578
forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that works so what what I</font>

1211
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:34,430
said that it's a really well engineered

1212
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:36,260
thing just trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then read</font>

1213
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tale aspect because it does say I</font>

1214
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,349
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember off the top my head</font>

1215
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:40,940
exact how does it I remember reading it

1216
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:43,040
and going all that makes sense that

1217
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,829
really cool and then immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1218
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,390
getting exactly how it was yeah that's

1219
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:52,849
the one part of TLS that I can never

1220
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:54,259
remember how ya giggling I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted a</font>

1221
00:56:52,849 --> 00:57:00,109
false positives in the end I have to

1222
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:06,079
know haha maybe I actually can't

1223
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:08,690
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh heck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that answer is on</font>

1224
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google then we are interval no I</font>

1225
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:13,920
actually can't remember be honest I'm on

1226
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:23,680
your life

1227
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:25,000
mi novia like anybody else cool thank

1228
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,259
