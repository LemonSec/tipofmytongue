1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:08,490
machine running hello everybody welcome

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an introduction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to data mining and</font>

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,290
machine learning so data mining machine

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,280
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and knowledge discovery there</font>

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,250
are a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> names for</font>

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,289
concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> similar of course</font>

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,330
I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be making you experts in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15</font>

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes but I hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the end of</font>

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,000
the presentation you will at least have

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,340
a better understanding of these terms so

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,470
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for today I will focus</font>

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,380
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discovery of knowledge in</font>

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,540
databases with a small example and give

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:44,160
you an insight in machine learning about

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,710
me so what my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jeremy i am from</font>

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,779
switzerland a small but beautiful

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,300
country in the middle of Europe you

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,949
should totally come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and visit and yes i</font>

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,919
did already milk a cow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love</font>

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,559
chocolate<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess some stereotypes do</font>

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,050
hold up i'm not very different from any

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,140
other students here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in appetite but</font>

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,000
except that i did do two weeks research

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,320
on machine learning before<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving this</font>

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,900
presentation great whoa bossing me

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,149
around already<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but first let me bit</font>

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a bit of context into my</font>

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,640
presentation when you work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company</font>

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,009
sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make this is a</font>

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision and these decisions are often</font>

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:31,860
based on data so the problem is that

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit that data it</font>

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,930
may be too big or beyond understanding

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,649
especially in the last few years we're

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,689
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data Rose exponentially</font>

36
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,119
humans cannot keep up with with it and

37
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,669
we can only expect it to grow even more

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,939
even larger we call that concept

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually we called that concept big data</font>

40
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:56,758
big data is the notion of having too

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,429
much data for traditional databases it's

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,680
too big it moves too fast or it just

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,979
doesn't correspond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the architecture</font>

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
of your database to gain value out of

45
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:12,430
this data you know if you find another

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">way of processing knowledge discovery</font>

47
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,599
is a process or framework that helps you

48
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,709
transform the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> into information and</font>

49
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">also helps you make predictions and</font>

50
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:29,049
decision out of the result seems scary

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,150
at first and you basically have a bunch

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,030
of databases that you process until

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,549
let's say Excel data sheet and you apply

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,379
data mining over it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to find</font>

55
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,159
patterns that will help you make

56
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:44,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision the process is a quite simple</font>

57
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the analysis can be complex</font>

58
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:51,970
depending on the type of variables you

59
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,970
have or the dependency well of course

60
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good idea better than anything</font>

61
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">else I hope you can see I see behind so</font>

62
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of the famous data</font>

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,858
set where you have to predict if an

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,049
adult<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to earn more or less than</font>

65
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:12,189
fifty thousand dollars here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

66
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:13,859
income here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning more or less</font>

67
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,448
than fifteen thousands per year

68
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:19,030
depending on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourteen variable</font>

69
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:21,519
from before after<font color="#E5E5E5"> processing the data</font>

70
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,919
sheet and finding the interesting values

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:29,019
the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> contain information we can</font>

72
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:31,449
then what we call mine for data see the

73
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,359
major<font color="#E5E5E5"> step of data mining after</font>

74
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,489
processing a database is to choose a

75
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,530
specific algorithm depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type</font>

76
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,259
of problem you have there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

77
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,560
algorithms and I won't detail a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

78
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:46,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">them or actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of them but I'll</font>

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,970
maybe talk a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them in</font>

80
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,949
machine learning what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,560
remember here is that choosing an

82
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,900
algorithm is not in there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,840
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> important part you also have to</font>

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">tweak its parameters that train it on</font>

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,449
part of the data to create a model and

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,489
apply it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest well let's have a</font>

87
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,939
look of how much code we need to do that

88
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example okay you can't see much</font>

89
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,870
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not I'm very</font>

90
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,149
important this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of our code</font>

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,728
that I wrote it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lines</font>

92
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:21,130
of code but it does the trick i would

93
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,930
say then worry too much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

94
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,580
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example and nowadays you can</font>

95
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,210
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in ten lines of code and</font>

96
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,219
whoever wants that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

97
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,840
email in that specific case it gives us

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,220
a model that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use to predict an</font>

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,619
outcome so if your relationship

100
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,860
relationship is a variable so if your

101
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship was to be in merit then you</font>

102
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,449
would have not easy person chances of

103
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:49,849
earning less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 50,000 thing judge me</font>

104
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the algorithm at a specific data set</font>

105
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:57,650
a team do that and in addition if your

106
00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:00,770
if your capital gain was under 7070 for

107
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,659
you have 95 certain chances of having

108
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,758
the same so of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to check</font>

109
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the accuracy and compared to</font>

110
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,490
performance with other algorithm but I

111
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,320
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that well</font>

112
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,410
again yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you want to talk</font>

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">about machine learning a bit machine</font>

114
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,440
learning is a lot like data mining that

115
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,130
the difference is that we define the

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,039
outcome of the program we define the

117
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,440
outcome and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program learns the steps</font>

118
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,320
to go there basically machine learning

119
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">focuses on prediction based on known</font>

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,259
properties learned from the training

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,449
data and uses a lot of trial and error

122
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:44,570
whilst data mining instead focuses on

123
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:47,449
learning pattern basically we can

124
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,610
basically use the steps of data mining

125
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:53,000
that a delay of training phase where

126
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,580
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and try all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time now</font>

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,669
i'm just going to define three<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

128
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,859
learning techniques the supervised one

129
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,620
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get feedback</font>

130
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,259
all the time and we'll know if it's

131
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,889
right or wrong and try to adjust

132
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,680
basically the unsupervised 11 in the

133
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,259
middle the role is to receive data and

134
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,169
model the<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlying structure of the</font>

135
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,110
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last one usually has a</font>

136
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">mix of label and unlabeled data and</font>

137
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,690
receive feedback any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the answers</font>

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:31,940
correct what that's true because machine

139
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,830
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very old well it depends</font>

140
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,979
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean by all but sorry old and</font>

141
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">was coined for the first time around</font>

142
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:43,430
1959 so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it suddenly come</font>

143
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,920
back you know why why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

145
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,750
to that is called deep learning now deep

146
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,849
learning is the cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge of machine</font>

147
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,130
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand it we have to</font>

148
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,000
start in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mid-50s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the first</font>

149
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:05,810
neuron model was being created<font color="#CCCCCC"> its model</font>

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,960
inputs some information lies we can see

151
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:15,200
here a matrix<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it sums it and if it's</font>

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:19,640
over a specific threshold will return

153
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,520
one or a zero it later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,169
techniques were invented to update the

155
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">weight of the information in real file</font>

156
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,910
called a back-propagation that's

157
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,070
creating what we call machine learning

158
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,000
algorithm because it would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

159
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:42,440
forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> back propagated wait and</font>

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,260
update them all the time so today we

161
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,690
have different architectures for what we

162
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,640
call neural networks that allow us to

163
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,680
transform known nonlinear models to<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

164
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,090
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> models by adding a lot of layers</font>

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,760
and simplifying the steps in between

166
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:01,729
adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that a big data set and a lot</font>

167
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,340
of computing power and deep learning can

168
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:10,960
outperform humans in tasks we thought

169
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:14,359
only we could be basic you so now

170
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,599
machine learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used in wide areas</font>

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,880
wants to make predictions when we train
