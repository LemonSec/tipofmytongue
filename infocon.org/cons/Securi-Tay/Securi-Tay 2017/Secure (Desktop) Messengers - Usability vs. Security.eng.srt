hello everybody today we are talking

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,150
about secure messengers and also the

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,379
desktop machines which you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> link to</font>

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the smartphone application and also</font>

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,150
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem usability versus</font>

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,060
security but Sir Posada that's all I

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,470
want to introduce ourselves so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

David hello we both graduated with a

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,260
bachelor degree in IT security at the

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,169
University of Applied Science in some

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,610
Calvin you want to get some more

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,800
information just with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website and we</font>

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,960
also currently studying master in

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,589
information security also at the same

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">University and also work for a small</font>

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,350
company called cross section in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vienna</font>

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,230
since more in two years we are we do

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,289
mainly penetration testing also<font color="#CCCCCC"> coda</font>

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,188
auditing and also social engineering

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:09,540
test it's quite interesting so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:12,899
where we can come from this mark is

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,960
where consultants located there's also

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,070
our university located and next to some

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,548
partners Riena where we work yeah what

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,399
we are talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you some recapped about</font>

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,950
what happened the last year regarding

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,590
secure messaging then we talked about

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,950
the problem I usability versus security

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,100
and also provide an example or<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,259
provide decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the messenger</font>

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,970
more usable that which effects the

34
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,310
security we also conducted a usability

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,829
study for the signal messenger last year

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,509
which we want to present the results and

37
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,789
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to present the desktop</font>

38
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,219
messenger so signal and what's up also

39
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,020
have desktop application which you can

40
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,699
link<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your smartphone application and</font>

41
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,160
what's how it's linking performed and

42
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,609
some general information about that

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,340
desta messengers

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:21,160
also security issues and they are rated

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:25,420
general issues about the both messengers

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:29,410
and yeah at final part is to conclude so

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:33,190
i'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the weekend yeah last</font>

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:36,010
year there was a large signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> desired to</font>

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,550
rename of the axolotl protocol which is

50
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,609
used by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal messenger to a signal</font>

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol and the idea all three and all</font>

52
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:50,459
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that all the things are now</font>

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,290
named signal which is kind of nice then

54
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,989
which was a big step what to decide to

55
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,130
implement dental clinic in protocol from

56
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:02,230
signal so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat NTN encrypted in</font>

57
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,820
the signal share a single chats or also

58
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:08,950
in the group chats which is very nice

59
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure how many of you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

60
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,940
desktop version of single but first of

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,220
all it was just closed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to get</font>

62
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,709
in a rise in<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then you can use</font>

63
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,060
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but then decided to get public</font>

64
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:29,230
and now everyone can use it this great

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:32,170
the certification also Google decided to

66
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,149
implement the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intern encryption protocol</font>

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,910
for a low so they have also another

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,049
messenger then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too so yeah Oh</font>

69
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:46,739
big companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to implement</font>

70
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:49,570
equate protocol then signal changed

71
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,160
verification page previously there were

72
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,799
two fingerprints you have to compare

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,870
which we see later on but now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

74
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,510
single safety number which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

75
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:03,220
compare and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> your can verify each</font>

76
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:06,070
other and signal also decide to

77
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,829
implement some sort of censorship circa

78
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,200
mention so some countries decided to

79
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,030
block the signal messenger and then they

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,048
implemented some nice stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now they</font>

81
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:21,339
can also use the signal messenger<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

82
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:25,549
yeah and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year there was the article</font>

83
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:29,270
about the whatsapp actor which we

84
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:33,169
also we'll discuss later on and describe

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,990
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really is yeah usability</font>

86
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,229
versus security so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's current</font>

87
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,389
problem and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with this</font>

88
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,639
what's it back door so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guardian</font>

89
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosted an article about yeah the</font>

90
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:51,409
assembly<font color="#CCCCCC"> security researcher found</font>

91
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:53,179
vector for whatsapp and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

92
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:57,979
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about and is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really a</font>

93
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:02,240
vector so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what website tried to</font>

94
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">educate a problem is what should the</font>

95
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,169
messenger duel if Bob is for example

96
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">reinstalling the application and edit</font>

97
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,060
sending a message at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment while</font>

98
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:18,198
publicly installing a message so first

99
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,449
of all Alice sends a message to to Bob

100
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,659
so and it sent to the server cells in

101
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,909
relation to Bob and then bob has to

102
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:29,900
reinstall the application you some

103
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:32,590
problems and this time I decided to send

104
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,669
another message but the seller<font color="#CCCCCC"> canes</font>

105
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,099
forward this message to Bob because

106
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:42,008
publicist not not online at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

107
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:45,490
and after Bob finished the installation

108
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:48,409
procedure he published in new keys and

109
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:53,599
then it is simply gets these new keys

110
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:58,460
and now there is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the garden</font>

111
00:05:53,599 --> 00:06:00,050
calling the back door the messenger

112
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:05,900
simply rien clips the message with the

113
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:09,409
new key and just send it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob so I</font>

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,090
need is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best solution but the</font>

115
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,069
problem is what should we should you

116
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,330
should the messenger do with this

117
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:20,080
message with just ignore or should there

118
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,469
be some warning and what's it also has

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,080
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use so-called non-blocking</font>

120
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:29,900
messaging so if a key change occur you

121
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,878
get no modification as you get no prompt

122
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,070
there we have to accept a new key you

123
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,399
simply get a notification if you enable

124
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,409
this feature and the messenger<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends the</font>

125
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,649
message anyway

126
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,629
you get a notification instead in signal

127
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,459
you have an from Georgia tell you okay

128
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:51,009
there is a new key do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to accept</font>

129
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:57,009
it and then it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message and</font>

130
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:57,009
this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we would call more</font>

131
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:06,229
recent problem for signal for example if

132
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:09,199
this message simply got lost so there

133
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,419
what would never ever get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this message</font>

134
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,529
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's not the best we how to</font>

135
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:17,599
handle this and we also want to show how

136
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:19,959
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be exploited by an attacker</font>

137
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,628
for example so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already mentioned</font>

138
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:26,689
single are Allison's a message this can

139
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:30,309
be multiple messages and publish at the

140
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:33,319
moment offline so the server can't

141
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:36,099
follow this message to Bob and within

142
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,129
this time slot Mary which the attacker

143
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:43,369
is able to register able to the count

144
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:47,619
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of phone number for</font>

145
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:50,539
example if she uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 71 ability or is</font>

146
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:52,519
able to get the verification code<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

147
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:57,378
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> required to register and what's the</font>

148
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:00,349
count I get this code and simply

149
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:04,159
registers and then else gets the new

150
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:06,919
keys and Ellis we transmit<font color="#E5E5E5"> this messages</font>

151
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:10,699
and would be forward to what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

152
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:14,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">memory but as you can see there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

153
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,339
warning so what said prompts<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

154
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:19,789
notification<font color="#CCCCCC"> key the key a key change</font>

155
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:23,389
report and there's something wrong but

156
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:25,839
you have no possibility to stop the to

157
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:30,709
cancel this descending so yeah

158
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:34,509
messengers are get Senate anyway it's

159
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:36,948
not maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best solution but</font>

160
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:40,750
mature is there if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

161
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:44,589
solution at the moment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

162
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,540
they are texting then he writes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

163
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:50,509
large papas online message so we have

164
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,760
two tix<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one tick means the message</font>

165
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,860
captivity reserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second tick me</font>

166
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,069
that the message is delivered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

167
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,220
other device and second one is only one

168
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:08,270
tick so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop is currently offline and</font>

169
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:09,650
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is now online again and then</font>

170
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,540
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a second tick</font>

171
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,600
and there is this notification okay the

172
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,640
security code changed and normally then

173
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,770
you should verify each other and check

174
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:24,319
if the fing other the save the number is

175
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:26,930
equal yeah next topic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,880
usability study we conducted last year

177
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,780
so together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a colleague from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

178
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,610
University<font color="#CCCCCC"> reyna we conducted a</font>

179
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,640
usability study so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to check out</font>

180
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how signal how usable is the</font>

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,900
messenger and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the problems is</font>

182
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:52,370
it easy to handle this was our<font color="#E5E5E5"> fed model</font>

183
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,890
so normally you send exchange message

184
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,710
between Alice and pops but the problem

185
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the keys which is which are required</font>

186
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,630
to send messages are returned by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

187
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,090
server so if the signal server for

188
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,700
example decides to return the wrong keys

189
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:12,740
where the server has access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

190
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">private keys he could intercept the</font>

191
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:20,450
messages and simply re-encrypted and

192
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,150
fold it to Bob so<font color="#E5E5E5"> chewy on another slide</font>

193
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how an end middle attacks could</font>

194
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:31,550
be performed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so Mary in this case</font>

195
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,830
exchanges public keys with Alice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font>

196
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,020
then he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to calculate the secrets</font>

197
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:40,460
which will require to communicate later

198
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:43,130
on and then they exchanged between LS

199
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,880
and pop int encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel and</font>

200
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,000
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob and Mary and Mary simply</font>

201
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,560
forwards all these messengers so

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,170
normally you get and signally get the

203
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,719
notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that he changed and you</font>

204
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept the new key and this was</font>

205
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,970
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a task which the President's head</font>

206
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,540
to fulfill

207
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,970
and to check how to react and what they

208
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,949
are doing so this were a task during the

209
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,689
usability study<font color="#E5E5E5"> such as sending</font>

210
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,810
messengers to the other communication

211
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:16,969
partner the next step was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keeping and</font>

212
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:21,888
configure a master password so you can

213
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:24,920
configure a password to protect your

214
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,139
local messages which are encrypted

215
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,810
anyway but you have to define a method

216
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,899
pestle so the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other can decrypt it</font>

217
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,300
anymore then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had to create a backup</font>

218
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,990
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local theater so the messengers</font>

219
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,889
descend and we started back up and then

220
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:47,689
we had to send messages again and then

221
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:50,600
we run our menu middle attack and tested

222
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:54,379
how direct and also it was another part

223
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,709
was to verify data at a party and yeah

224
00:11:54,379 --> 00:12:00,199
all this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to perform the</font>

225
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:03,290
verification and what are the problems

226
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,689
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was to interview the</font>

227
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,160
participants and ask them okay you know

228
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:13,309
what happened just we just happened and

229
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,610
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so quite interesting results yeah</font>

230
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:19,699
we had seven females to his<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants and</font>

231
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,779
twenty-one male participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

232
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:25,490
between 18 and 35 years old and we also

233
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,740
had a questionnaire<font color="#CCCCCC"> II where we ask the</font>

234
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,800
people k out to know something about

235
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,170
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have seven</font>

236
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,008
told us<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they had no knowledge about</font>

237
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:39,800
this 17<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah some knowledge and for ya</font>

238
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:42,500
they have a lot of knowledge but there

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,729
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> no experts which dealing with this</font>

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,470
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and</font>

241
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,250
about the background<font color="#CCCCCC"> so most of them</font>

242
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:56,300
used what set the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise but only</font>

243
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">one you signal before yeah you can see</font>

244
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the step where we started our menu</font>

245
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,550
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack so they're just exchanged</font>

246
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,430
those journal messages that doesn't

247
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,250
matter they communicate with each other

248
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,489
and then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> our main the middle</font>

249
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,079
attack then you get this red mark and

250
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,670
then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to click on this message</font>

251
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,780
then

252
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,760
get the next page<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some issues</font>

253
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,089
occurred and you had to wear it you have

254
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,000
to verify the other Margie communication

255
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:32,350
partner and this is the first problem so

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,740
many people thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as you the</font>

257
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">total</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is before there was a step to</font>

258
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,170
verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other party and some people</font>

259
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,240
just thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there is the very</font>

260
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,160
fertile if I click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

261
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,620
button I verified the other party and

262
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,160
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fine but the others that's</font>

263
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,130
not really how verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> is should</font>

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,480
people on yeah when you click on this

265
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,530
very of a button and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the next</font>

266
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,970
message in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can accept the</font>

267
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:05,770
new key or cancel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby stopped</font>

268
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:08,830
messaging and it would also be possible

269
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to click on this may wish to air for</font>

270
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:14,160
this content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

271
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,440
possibility to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other partner</font>

272
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,069
but no one of the participants click on

273
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:26,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">this message so yeah it didn't see it or</font>

274
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:28,270
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know yeah how the participants</font>

275
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,819
should verify each other so you have

276
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sensi-button the conversation</font>

277
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,340
settings then you have to button verify

278
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,270
identity and then you get these strange

279
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,490
numbers and characters and yeah it's

280
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,560
very difficult when you see this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

281
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">first time you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think okay what should I</font>

282
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,140
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these days numbers and then you</font>

283
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:54,490
have your identity your identity or and

284
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:58,030
yeah so many people got confused and

285
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,580
didn't know what to do and it was all

286
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,069
the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was very difficult just to</font>

287
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,710
get the also find all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps to get</font>

288
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,500
there and it was already possible to

289
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,560
simply scan the QR code which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is located</font>

290
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,580
there so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

291
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,780
reach normally if you scan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karkos you</font>

292
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,790
get these two methods these

293
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:23,050
notifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's very sad or it's</font>

294
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,699
not verified and then we run our<font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

295
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tech normally you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

296
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,490
the message k not verified

297
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,360
and yeah but what should you do after

298
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:38,370
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very fat although how to decide</font>

299
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,810
so this were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result only seven</font>

300
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:45,209
participants were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

301
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:51,569
other and the other 21 people here

302
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:54,399
didn't make it made it and some

303
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:58,449
participants simply asking the chat

304
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,399
which got many<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle path so yeah are</font>

305
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:01,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you Bob is everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then</font>

306
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,790
which has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

307
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:07,509
everything's fine or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the option</font>

308
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask the other guy into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the room and</font>

309
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,850
ask and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some participants just asked</font>

310
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hi robot and Demi said okay yeah</font>

311
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:20,139
yeah Bob yeah maybe not the best option

312
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,508
the problem is simply they don't know

313
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:27,550
what this means is verification that is

314
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:32,440
to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other party and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

315
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:37,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to implement so what should</font>

316
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:41,829
simply yeah keep just keep this part

317
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:44,560
sorry keep this part to accept a new key

318
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:46,870
so they simply show a notification okay

319
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,018
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he changed and then you could</font>

320
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,290
verify each other but they don't force

321
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:55,990
the people to accept the new kid because

322
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,300
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hit okay yeah and not</font>

323
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,839
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everything</font>

324
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,000
is fine so then we also wrote a paper

325
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,669
about that and added some

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,010
recommendations so as already<font color="#E5E5E5"> told the</font>

327
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:11,919
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best choice</font>

328
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:17,829
should be renamed and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

329
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,510
keys or yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's verifies computing</font>

330
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,629
then they should redesign the

331
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,908
verification page because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

332
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,069
fingerprints are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best choice and</font>

333
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:29,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QR code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be on the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page</font>

334
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,299
you should get a help message okay what

335
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,480
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should you do and what is</font>

336
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:37,320
this all about and also it would be nice

337
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,090
to have a very patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> status so if you</font>

338
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,149
verified on other people

339
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,279
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take or some</font>

340
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,309
mark okay you already verified these

341
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,100
people so if you have I don't know many

342
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,710
contacts and started with you of them

343
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,539
and then get laid down back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

344
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,850
verify the other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know</font>

345
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:02,200
anymore which one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already verified</font>

346
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:05,309
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit difficult so yet as</font>

347
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,200
already mentioned the recap section they

348
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,840
has now the safety numbers and they also

349
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,049
we designed the verification page so

350
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,090
it's very nice so they has it's the quad

351
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:18,520
code at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same page you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

352
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,879
safety number which has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the same</font>

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">number on both devices so you meet that</font>

354
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,980
in person and check the number for

355
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,539
example and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a description okay</font>

356
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:34,600
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> should you do and what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

357
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:36,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">about so yeah very nice and well done so</font>

358
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:43,178
next part is about the desktop

359
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:46,059
messengers yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you over the last</font>

360
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,220
couple of months we had a look at two

361
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,129
different types of messages so we had a

362
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,029
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal desktop and we had a look</font>

363
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:58,029
at what's up web so and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

364
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:00,840
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with single desktop and it looks</font>

365
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:04,480
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's a Chrome extension and</font>

366
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,309
yeah it was released last year in closed

367
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,970
beta and you have to get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> invite and</font>

368
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:13,330
then yeah like he mentioned in the recap

369
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:17,919
session earlier this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beta is</font>

370
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:21,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">publically publicly available so you</font>

371
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,580
have to install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it by a chrome store or</font>

372
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,419
you can do it yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want and</font>

373
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:30,399
yeah how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it work the main</font>

374
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,100
difference between signal desktop and

375
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:36,489
whatsapp web is that signal desktop is a

376
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,178
standalone application so yeah you need

377
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:43,539
chrome button and you can you can send

378
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:46,330
messages without that the smartphone is

379
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:48,250
online so you really have the identity

380
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,178
keys on your phone but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

381
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,440
explain this<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it uses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> car codes to</font>

382
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:55,720
exchange

383
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,269
the public keys which are needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

384
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,690
calculate the secrets which are in

385
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:07,330
further are used to encrypt the messages

386
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:11,139
and it's open source so yeah when you

387
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:13,120
install signal desktop then you have

388
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:16,990
this choir code which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scan</font>

389
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,629
on your mobile phone to in order to link

390
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,899
the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your existing signal</font>

391
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:24,850
account so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need an existing signal</font>

392
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:27,340
account which is registered to your

393
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,699
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and then you're going to</font>

394
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,230
scan the square code and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

395
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,769
to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

396
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit complicated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so first of all</font>

397
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:45,039
the signal desktop client requests the

398
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">uuid from the signal server this then</font>

399
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,230
after the signal desktop has this<font color="#E5E5E5"> UID</font>

400
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,549
with which is then<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uniquely</font>

401
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:56,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the signal desktop application</font>

402
00:20:53,549 --> 00:21:01,000
the signal desktop generates public and

403
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:04,539
private keys and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal mobile</font>

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,529
can stick to our code and this choir

405
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,600
code contains this public key so now the

406
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,399
single mobile application has this

407
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,080
public key which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is which which got</font>

408
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:19,870
generated by the single desktop and then

409
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,990
signal mobile requests this provisioning

410
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:26,889
code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the verify code which you</font>

411
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:29,980
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is similar to to the verification</font>

412
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:32,320
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get when you first install the</font>

413
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:37,899
signal mobile app so like what you get

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,269
via SMS or<font color="#CCCCCC"> via phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signal</font>

415
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:42,279
mobile encrypts the identity and the

416
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:46,269
provisioning code using the derived

417
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:48,789
secret so signal mobile using this

418
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:53,139
public key and newly generated private

419
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:56,889
key is able to generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> shared secret</font>

420
00:21:53,139 --> 00:22:00,758
and then signal mobile sense this

421
00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:03,969
identity information to the signal

422
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,610
desktop application so here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

423
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big difference signal mobile is</font>

424
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,570
actually

425
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,510
the sending the<font color="#E5E5E5"> private identity keys to</font>

426
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,610
the single disturb and that's why signal

427
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,910
desktop is sustained alone messaging

428
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,840
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> for signal mobile can be</font>

429
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:26,230
offline and you can send messages from

430
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:31,540
signal desktop with your identity so

431
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:34,200
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the user gives some name to</font>

432
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:37,060
the signal desktop application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

433
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,460
new random password is generated wishes

434
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,580
which is then<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticate to</font>

435
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the to the signal server and using the</font>

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,870
provisioning code which got transmitted

437
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,169
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single mobile application to</font>

438
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,320
the signal desktop the single server is

439
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,830
able to cross-check provisioning coats

440
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,110
and so in order to to match signal

441
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,560
mobile and signal desktop to each other

442
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:09,689
so that it's too that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table on</font>

443
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:13,240
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the single server</font>

444
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:18,100
replies with with an ident device ID

445
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,290
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used later on to to to</font>

446
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:25,449
send messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the signal desktops or</font>

447
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:28,810
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> desk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland yeah and then</font>

448
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,530
we're nearly finished signal desktop

449
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:35,500
creates new keys add this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server</font>

450
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:38,490
they are then later on needed to send

451
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,340
end-to-end encrypted messages and then

452
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:46,750
the signal mobile is similar mobile

453
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:49,800
application is able to send the contacts

454
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:54,720
which are stored on the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and</font>

455
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:57,820
group memberships to the signal desktop

456
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,720
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tenets and it's finished</font>

457
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,720
gym so how it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking working so</font>

458
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,870
it's just a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing fancy it's just</font>

459
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,360
a normal single message because a signal

460
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:14,489
desktop is a standalone application you

461
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:19,419
can send signal messages to the signal

462
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:21,080
desktop client and yeah the contacts and

463
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,940
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> members</font>

464
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,600
are sent to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal desktop via a</font>

465
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:32,990
normal signal message so nothing fancy

466
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:37,389
is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so the first kind of</font>

467
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:39,920
vulnerability which is a known problem

468
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,140
signal desktop and not only sing the

469
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,800
best of signal mobile also has this

470
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:50,240
problem leaks phone numbers and device

471
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:53,690
ID so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to man in the</font>

472
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,360
middle like the TLS traffic between the

473
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,570
client and the server you are able to

474
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">enumerate the the numbers the phone</font>

475
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:06,350
numbers of the of the messaging partners

476
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:08,840
and also the device IDs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

477
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,090
here you can say well the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

478
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,760
it's this number then this<font color="#CCCCCC"> number than</font>

479
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,679
this number and then you can match to

480
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:22,190
each number you can match the device IDs

481
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:27,410
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here this those three</font>

482
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:31,310
they have 24 they have the device ID 24

483
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:34,850
then the second one has 245 and this one

484
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:37,730
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> only five so you can say okay this</font>

485
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,649
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number has three devices linked to</font>

486
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,600
it the first has two devices linked to

487
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,330
it and the search has only one device

488
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,939
linked to it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> due to the fact</font>

489
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device IDs are like one two</font>

490
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five you can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

491
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">last one has probably uninstalled the</font>

492
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:58,629
app for four times and now he made his

493
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:03,470
fifth attempt to install the app and

494
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:07,100
another problem is that the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

495
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:10,070
is included in the get request so i

496
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:13,699
don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that when then</font>

497
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,909
signal uploads the context<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server</font>

498
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,910
it does not upload it in plain it

499
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,220
uploads it in a hash format to prevent

500
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,460
this kind of information leakage but

501
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,060
then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send messages it's</font>

502
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:32,120
included in the get request and probably

503
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:34,490
they store it in log files or somewhere

504
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,550
so like the signal server runs in the

505
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:42,110
Amazon Cloud and I think that Amazon may

506
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:44,600
have some locks so maybe amazon is able

507
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,340
to like enumerate all the signal users

508
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,780
and their phone numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the device</font>

509
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:54,320
IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see this as kind of a problem</font>

510
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:56,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I I don't know why they are doing</font>

511
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,689
this in a get request they kept simply

512
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:06,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">use post and then it's not included in</font>

513
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:08,900
the log files normally yeah then we had

514
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,429
a look what what happens when we men in

515
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,160
the middle the communication with a

516
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,110
signal desktop and then you get by

517
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,840
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get like this notification</font>

518
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,139
your safety number her state has changed

519
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,909
but like you can see it's not blocking

520
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:28,910
so you can just continue and you can

521
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,960
send messages again but it's it's not

522
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:36,560
blocked this outgoing message if you

523
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,580
want to have like this this this

524
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,100
blocking feature then you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

525
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this feature like safety numbers</font>

526
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,360
approval which means you have to approve

527
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,240
that this safety number is the correct

528
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:55,129
one before you can again send messages

529
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,680
and when you enable this feature then

530
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,770
you can send a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message again after many</font>

531
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,140
middle attack takes place and then you

532
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:07,010
have this red warning again and then you

533
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,920
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the new key and then you</font>

534
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,390
can verify the safety number and then

535
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:17,360
you can accept it and then you're fine

536
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,760
so this water was a short overview of

537
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,770
signal desktop and now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

538
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,780
analyze that different differences

539
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:27,230
between signal desktop and whatsapp web

540
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,120
so what the web looks like this and it's

541
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,390
a it's a web application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

542
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,979
simply go on the web web app<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

543
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:42,770
whatsapp web dot whatsapp com and you

544
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:44,930
can again can scan a QR code and yeah

545
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,129
linking procedure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to explain a</font>

546
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,810
look later but it

547
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:52,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that complicated like with</font>

548
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">single desktop the characteristics like</font>

549
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:58,540
yeah its mobile dependent so you need a

550
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:02,000
mobile phone which has an active

551
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,670
internet connection so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what's a web</font>

552
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,790
application sends all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages to</font>

553
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:13,010
the mobile and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> relay the mobile</font>

554
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:15,620
relays it to the other party again it's

555
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,660
it's using a quar code for calculating

556
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:21,229
the necessary secrets it's closed source

557
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:24,170
of course and yeah there are some

558
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:27,410
privacy concerns which I'm we can

559
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,930
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> later yeah here we have this</font>

560
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,180
choir code you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scan this in the</font>

561
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,920
web application and here you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

562
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">small remarks I don't know if you can</font>

563
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,270
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it said to reduce mobile</font>

564
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,550
data usage connect the phone to Wi-Fi so

565
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,400
this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you the phone need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

566
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:47,300
connected to internet and due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

567
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:50,800
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages are uploaded from</font>

568
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,020
the smartphone to the web application

569
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:58,220
you should activate Wi-Fi in order to

570
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:02,780
reduce the data charges so the linking

571
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,540
procedure works like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> following the</font>

572
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,580
whatsapp web client generates key pairs

573
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:12,860
and generates the squire code which

574
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:15,800
again contains this public key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

575
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,550
whatsapp web client also periodically

576
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,710
updates the parameter which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

577
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,930
ref which is like a reference for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

578
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">photo web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> socket which is established</font>

579
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:31,060
later on and then the whatsapp client

580
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,800
against the QR code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

581
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,290
contains this reference parameter the

582
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:40,790
public key and the browser ID which is

583
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">again needed for for identifying the</font>

584
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:46,490
whatsapp web application then what's up

585
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,240
is able to generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key material</font>

586
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:53,990
which is needed and here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

587
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:57,020
difference in comparison to signal

588
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,510
desktop whatsapp web calculates two

589
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,500
secrets so two symmetric keys

590
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:05,060
one symmetric key which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the</font>

591
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,580
message encryption key which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

592
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,710
actually used to symmetrically encrypt

593
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:13,760
the communication between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's a web</font>

594
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,310
and what set mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one key to</font>

595
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypt the message encryption keys for</font>

596
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,730
transferring it from whatsapp to

597
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatsapp web so here the message</font>

598
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,210
encryption keys are generated and then

599
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:32,210
encrypted again with a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> M symmetric</font>

600
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,640
key and is then delivered to what the

601
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:40,000
web which is then able to decrypt the

602
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:42,770
message encryption keys and ya then

603
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,780
whatsapp web uploads the encrypted

604
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:50,480
messages and the group<font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts and</font>

605
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:55,120
everything to whatsapp web so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

606
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:59,930
see we we have this mobile dependent

607
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:04,580
what's a web client which yeah which

608
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:07,640
uses a symmetric encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel web</font>

609
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:11,870
web socket channel to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

610
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,350
the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile client so whatsapp</font>

611
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:17,300
web app whatsapp mobile uploads the chat

612
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,929
history so all the chats which are

613
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,169
stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mobile are uploaded to</font>

614
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:27,350
what's a web and the images are stored

615
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:30,740
inside the they are stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the server</font>

616
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:33,230
in an encrypted format and if image is

617
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,560
requested from what's up from the from

618
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user then it's downloaded and it's</font>

619
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,879
decrypted locally so yeah in order to

620
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:48,260
reduce data charges of course so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

621
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,450
can see here that's that's when the when

622
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,330
the whatsapp web what's that mobile

623
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,440
client uploads the messages and here you

624
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:01,000
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it's the WebSocket connection</font>

625
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:06,170
and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the binary frames so</font>

626
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,620
for encryption yeah it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> a symmetric</font>

627
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,960
key like I told you before and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

628
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,699
store you can you can view this key in

629
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,670
the

630
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,910
chrome debugging tools and there is one

631
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">issue and this this key remains the same</font>

632
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:24,940
for for the whole session so if you

633
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,270
don't unlink your your device for a

634
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,730
longer time this key remains the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

635
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have like future secrecy or</font>

636
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:36,730
forward secrecy or something like this

637
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:41,020
if this key gets compromised person with

638
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:43,780
men in the middle capabilities is able

639
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,430
to decrypt messages which has exchanged

640
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:50,610
between the mobile and the web

641
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:55,450
application so yeah that's another point

642
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:58,990
hmm yeah default settings and privacy

643
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:02,320
concerns like yeah whatsapp web uses the

644
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:05,350
settings of the mobile of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile app</font>

645
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:10,810
because it's what the web is just a few

646
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:13,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application and as</font>

647
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:15,969
you can see the default setting we

648
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:19,299
tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on an iphone application</font>

649
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:21,489
it's like the share my account info I

650
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,070
don't know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but it shares some</font>

651
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:28,569
data with facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

652
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:31,030
like it it's an able by default the last

653
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">scene and everything else is also</font>

654
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:36,820
enabled by default so you can do like

655
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,679
this tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> where when when does this</font>

656
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:44,020
person go to sleep when does he wake up

657
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so on yeah the show security</font>

658
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,350
notifications in disabled by default so

659
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:56,530
yeah so when you want to man in the

660
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,960
middle whatsapp communication he won't

661
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:04,710
recognize until he really verifies the

662
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:08,110
theater party default settings and

663
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:12,040
privacy yeah whats app sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

664
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:15,550
bunch of data to the server regularly so

665
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,680
what's up since the battery level so

666
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:20,410
like eighty percent charger i don't know

667
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,049
if it's plugged in or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

668
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,750
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this data the location the</font>

669
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,720
language settings the exact version

670
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:33,520
information and this is really

671
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,770
interesting press fresh messages even

672
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">when the application doesn't crash so I</font>

673
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:43,430
don't know but if you monitor the

674
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic there are crash messages sent to</font>

675
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:50,089
the server even if the application works

676
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,720
perfectly and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user won't recognize</font>

677
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:58,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so it's happening in the background</font>

678
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:00,709
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see between those two</font>

679
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:06,500
messages and then in the middle took

680
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:08,180
place yeah looks perfect so no no

681
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,220
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> gnostic notifications by</font>

682
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:14,990
default so you should all enable this

683
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:18,379
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> notification if you have</font>

684
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:21,580
enabled this security notification then

685
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:28,910
you get the same information like in

686
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:32,420
signal desktop and then you can use the

687
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:35,899
quad code to scan it we can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload</font>

688
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:39,920
a code<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 which is then verified in the</font>

689
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:43,400
web application but<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember it's non</font>

690
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,910
blocking so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in signal where you</font>

691
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,320
have to manually resend the messages

692
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,870
when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> man-in-the-middle takes place and</font>

693
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,660
you have sent a bunch of messages

694
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,910
they're all they're all sent away so so

695
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:00,319
there is no blocking feature like<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

696
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">hazard so and now kristef is telling you</font>

697
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,350
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general issues we</font>

698
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:08,780
found in our research and yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

699
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:13,460
yeah general issues we discount for both

700
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:17,150
tested applications so i gave it already

701
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:20,420
mentioned you mentioned yeah they're

702
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,990
mainly bit of JavaScript so if an

703
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:26,480
attacker can inject JavaScript code

704
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:28,879
yellow would perform across<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

705
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,830
scripting attack during our research we

706
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,530
did not discovered such and

707
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:37,038
vulnerability but we just thought about

708
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:39,499
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> what could an attack a tool to do</font>

709
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,499
yeah an attacker would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

710
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:45,558
messages because they are locally stores

711
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:48,229
and the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between what the</font>

712
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:51,229
weapons signal desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> David also</font>

713
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:53,029
mentioned signal is standalone and needs

714
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:55,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">the identity keys and what to that</font>

715
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:59,140
simply transmit from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

716
00:37:55,729 --> 00:38:01,788
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the web application and</font>

717
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,640
so the private identity keys are stored

718
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:08,299
at the signal desktop application and if

719
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,719
an attacker can check JavaScript codes

720
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:15,529
he also can extract the private identity

721
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:17,779
identity keys and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did if you</font>

722
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:21,529
perform some animal attack you wouldn't

723
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:23,390
get such an prompt locator the safety

724
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:26,089
number change because the attacker has

725
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:28,489
that right at n to the key and would be

726
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:31,308
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to many middle and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

727
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:33,679
notice that yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably</font>

728
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,089
easier to exploit and cross the

729
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,679
scripting within the website web

730
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:40,699
application because this is an

731
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:44,479
application and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chrome</font>

732
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:48,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">extension maybe isn't that easy to</font>

733
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:52,549
exploit but what else and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

734
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:55,609
is yeah you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to score codes to link</font>

735
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:59,900
a desktop application to an existing

736
00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:02,239
account and so what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be if an</font>

737
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,989
attacker simply inject and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our codes</font>

738
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:08,569
for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done secured</font>

739
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:11,119
communication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a middle</font>

740
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:13,369
position simply inject such an promo

741
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,519
code and tail okay yeah just scared and

742
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get free stuff very nice you have to</font>

743
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,408
scan this with your whatsapp web

744
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,569
application what's that mobile

745
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:28,400
application or you just create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

746
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:32,569
phishing website and place there such a

747
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,749
barcode so yeah don't think like that so

748
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:37,669
free stuff Jana I should take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font>

749
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:40,848
should really think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and yeah</font>

750
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:43,029
why should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ever skin such an quarrels</font>

751
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:46,840
and yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

752
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:50,560
so the last point is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the storage</font>

753
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:53,740
so what's abuse is the local browser

754
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,400
cache it stores all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dates in clear</font>

755
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:02,640
text plain signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses in so-called</font>

756
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:05,230
index DB which got introduced in html5

757
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is for the mobile</font>

758
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,810
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signal you have the</font>

759
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:13,210
feature to encrypt all the messengers

760
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:15,370
but this isn't available for signal

761
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,250
desktop so all the messages are plain

762
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,500
text stored on your local disk which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

763
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:24,370
not very nice but there is no

764
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:29,680
implementation yet to use index DB and

765
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:33,430
to encrypt all these data in easy way so

766
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,109
the conclusion as we heard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard</font>

767
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:39,399
sections of signal protocol that's

768
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">widely adopted and used by several big</font>

769
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:47,530
messengers to use internships Chet yeah

770
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:49,960
what this focuses more on usability so

771
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,090
you have to secure it notifications

772
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,070
disabled by default so if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

773
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,470
men in the middle attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing you</font>

774
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:59,290
wouldn't notice that and until you

775
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,330
verify that our contact and you have

776
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,930
this retransmission problem so we don't

777
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:06,970
think its impact or but we think they

778
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:10,750
should fix it or do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another way</font>

779
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:14,500
better way maybe yeah and signal focuses

780
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:18,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">in security but yeah this also makes it</font>

781
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,530
in some case more unusable and yeah you

782
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,390
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to security notifications enabled</font>

783
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:25,840
by default so the notifications you

784
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:29,290
can't disable defeat notifications but

785
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,720
you can disable this blocking mode so

786
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,550
that the messenger simply accepts a new

787
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,480
key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chats prompts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notification</font>

788
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:41,140
tells<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there is a key change all</font>

789
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,960
these warnings which is which we saw in

790
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the study</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the usability study can</font>

791
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,610
irritate the users so they don't know

792
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,759
what to do and are confused and simply

793
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:55,589
click exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept accept because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

794
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,839
what should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do well</font>

795
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:59,578
and providers can always men in the

796
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,460
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uses because these</font>

797
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,099
keys are distributed year their servers

798
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:10,519
and if the service returns simply and

799
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:12,479
another here you can own the verify data

800
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,868
communication partner and check if the

801
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:19,169
keys if the identity is correct and yeah

802
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:21,359
many middle is always possible yeah both

803
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> desktop parents store their</font>

804
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,369
messages in clear text on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and</font>

805
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:29,309
regarding privacy yeah what's it makes

806
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:31,710
money out of your data so even if the

807
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:34,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">jets are owned and trained encrypted you</font>

808
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:39,660
still have to meet the data which can be

809
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:43,288
sailed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and yeah not sure if</font>

810
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:47,969
it wanted wanted yeah signal focus is

811
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:50,819
more on privacy and yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

812
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:53,249
a big surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we as security focus</font>

813
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:57,119
people prefer signal or what's up and

814
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:58,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah that was</font>

815
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:10,289
our talks think you're not for attention

816
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:17,579
and share questions questions and the

817
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:20,660
flights are online they're all right

818
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,660
