00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,590
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inherent weaknesses well</font>

so I suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> he tends to go quite</font>

117
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,219
organically and people build a small

companies the by other offices so and so

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,400
forth and these all just get joined and

121
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:14,219
trusted and much together so that they

204
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,860
is saved in part with the

207
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:55,459
is that you can actually close the users

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:58,140
and carers hash for offline cracking and

209
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,670
what does allow you to do once you've

210

got that password for offline cracking

something called group for Andrew

455
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,780
won't do that so being Microsoft in the

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,100
clever chaps they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they decided to</font>

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:23,210
using the F key great friends okay es q

took the standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okey the key was only</font>

459
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,420
32 bit long so that's not great but he

460
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,230
never mind defies what's the one thing

461
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,400
they could do to maybe make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

462
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,400
they published the key len at the end

463
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,590
yep so there's the presence of policy

464
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,340
file format gives you the 32 that ESP

465

466
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,570
made dozens of tools over there but

467
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,679
allow you to go and quickly scrape

468

are because they are encrypted signal

472
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,400
hashset back and forth so it's really

473
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,750
really really trivial to simply get a

excusing the context of the main admin

that's been suboptimal and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

570

what it actually does and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ain't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

hard-coded accred they can't be changed

577
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,720
because the vein that no longer exists

what was the clients only option you

579
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:04,889
just had to accept the risk so again

591
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:46,010
does basically is you can run as /

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,860

the password of the parameter this is a

596
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,870
deliberate design decision by

597
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,400
Microsoft's saw that credentials when be

lying all these batch files<font color="#E5E5E5"> value per</font>

00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,379
that oh I'll be fine

602
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,840
but that's really angered some really

603
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:17,860
lazy people they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do</font>

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,500
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bill it to that</font>

607
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:33,040
by Scripps so someone who's written a

tool to undo<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Microsoft quite really</font>

609
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:42,820
thought was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good design too soon so</font>

610
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:45,720
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of a use of power views on</font>

companies the mean of the standard user

612

use the purview of econ module so I

613
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,270
thought what I'll do is I'll look for

614
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,580
all users night to directly that have a

616
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,590
normally as user laughs or do not remove

617
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,699
that the cone or bog second the cone or

618
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:06,159
whatever so around nice and / reviewed

619
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,260
to just find all users whereas the

620
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,340
description have anything in it and just

621
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:14,490
bring the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name in the</font>

622
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:17,590

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,200
a lot of third-party software can help

715
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">people administer the remains and what's</font>

716
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,680
the security posture of it like well I

717
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,630
mean you saw there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reset</font>

718
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,550
thing is someone someone bought to do

719
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,690
self-service password management and I

720
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,419
guess it worked because everyone can

721
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,360
self serve everyone but a lot of these

722
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are like so I am solution to also</font>

723
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,139
enroll users and do all that sort of

724
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,020
stuff the problem with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these</font>

725
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,220
tools is need to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> durston in admin so</font>

726
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,320
you've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

727
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,890
passing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the me Nigel ashes all over the</font>

728
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,300
network maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as securely that hash</font>

729
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,060
has restored somewhere so you've got

730
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,070
Tamina ads and passwords stored and

731
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,600
about software a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> do very</font>

732
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,850
good things with a couple of good third

733
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,879
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> products for enforcing better</font>

734
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,189
password complexity requirements and

735
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came to supports it if you set</font>

736
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,890
your own dll file<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the main</font>

737
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,240
controller but

738
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,680
some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that's a third-party</font>

739
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,620
software for managing password

740
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,970
complexity but beyond that or most of

741
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:57,300
them all they're doing is expanding the

742
00:32:44,970 --> 00:33:01,680
attack surface so it was the

743
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:03,510
functionality was removed and also thank

744
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,700
you and so the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> was how often is</font>

745
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:08,940
the GP password stuff appear on

746
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,650
penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests and the answer is it</font>

747
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,170
varies doesn't work all the time they're

748
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:16,740
always there and Microsoft can move the

749
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,530
functionality in 2014 so if you've not

750
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,630
changed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lean since 2014 is still</font>

751
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,490
there if you've not updated your domain

752
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,890
controller in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years is</font>

753
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:44,700
still there so we still see it quite a

754
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:47,100
lot believe it or not yet anyone so the

755
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,720
question there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> what and so do you</font>

756
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,899
mean like what and the main level<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

757
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,190
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font>

758
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,710
accident early has something called mean

759
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,690
functional level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

760
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,600
features and supports and the question

761
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:07,650
is what we commonly see and people are

762
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to move towards 2012 2008 but</font>

763
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work on a lowest common</font>

764
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,169
denominator for people still got two

765
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,730
thousand three BCS kicking about

766
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:19,980
generally the functional level is 2003

767
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,050
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I mean again it's hard</font>

768
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,199
these these things control entire

769
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:27,330
businesses and if you don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

770
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,040
guys with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boss sorry no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one can log</font>

771
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the next three weeks I try to do an</font>

772
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">operation didn't go well so that's</font>

773
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,530
that's why the criticality of these

774
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:41,949
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sometimes our security</font>

775
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:42,820
downfall one else smell good right

776
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,389
