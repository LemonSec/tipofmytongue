19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,020
second when you are submitting talks you

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,610
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a title really that's</font>

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,770
really clever and then I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the high slit rubbish so I'm I said</font>

exempt from such sexy stuff without the

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,820
next so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges</font>

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing talking three months out you</font>

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
thinking I've got a headline a headline

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,860
then you think you know you slept with

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,220
it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of my alternative one</font>

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,020
so a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> about me I look day job by</font>

other work as well and yeah it's not one

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,229
for most important obviously that's

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,419
where I do now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font>

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,679
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

58
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,350
how to try to out defeat ransomware how

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,840
it coding was them I'm take a great

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,569
I've got no idea of timing on this tool

62
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,010
because i virtually run through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

the bar about an hour ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

64
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,780

<font color="#CCCCCC">one can't right then see you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so the</font>

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,540
business side of ransomware and how it's

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,459
an industry we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something about</font>

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the impact it's having a pretty</font>

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,319
massive issue continuous for the

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,230
business so the thing that kind of

78
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,488
bothered me a lot about ransomware what

79
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,750
more than feather that's really hitting

80
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,190
people is we've gone from big worms and

81
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,190
you see lots of film references in this

82
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,450
I love culture records film so if which

83
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,859
was broke on you'll be cheering every

84
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,480
time you saw one but we're all on coke

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,870
and I in brew some reasons though and

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,510
yeah basically we're gone from when I

87
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,090
started out in writing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT was</font>

88
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,190
somewhere I security it was configure

89
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,739
and some of you probably as old as me

90
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember stuff like that and then we</font>

91
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,390
might went on to various other things I

92
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't get the sum one identify here at</font>

93
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,320
the point when<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that the threat</font>

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
landscape completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> change from being</font>

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,489
very sophisticated to being absolutely

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,160
rubbish so essentially you know we

97
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,109
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> with massive worms in 2010 and</font>

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,079
you know who remembers sucks net sucks

worth a terrible sides of it really

104
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth looking at problem is</font>

562
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,889
consumers and IT yes I he has led to

563
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:06,090
this immediacy that's allowed ransomware

564
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,130
to spread and you know actually become

565
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,959
come what it is so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we carry</font>

566
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,190
devices once over there now taken out

567
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,990
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I see something to click on</font>

568
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,330
it what happens I'll do I've got myself

569
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,030
down it's pretty when<font color="#E5E5E5"> droid yeah network</font>

570
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,090
connected devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> through you know</font>

571
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,290
attached storage it's tricky and this is

572
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,000
all contributed to the you know the

573
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">scourge around somewhere on the other</font>

575
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,460
developer they now have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

576
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,530
anything cutter that's sticky

577
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,390
sophisticated anymore there's barely a

578
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,649
new 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> days anymore even though that</font>

579
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,480
there's probably not that many around

580
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,150
the research level goes down it's off

581
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,770
the shelf you can buy distributor people

582
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,450
click on it and you inspect all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

583
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,760
people that you know you want to insects

584
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,950
and you get paid millions for it

585
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you might not last very long as it</font>

586
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,970
said if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in California get</font>

588
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:56,580
arrested everywhere else so yeah it's

589
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,379
what i wanted to point out in this talk

590
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,320
was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hype really you know it isn't</font>

591
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about hype ransomware it's about it's</font>

592
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,429
about to reel out it's a reality it's

593
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,840
the real thing and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

594
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just to wrap up isn't comfortable</font>

595
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,159
well ahead of time actually but is what

596
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,490
the industry has actually been doing to

597
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,860
try and address this so in particular

598
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,660
this one appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> so six world with 2014</font>

599
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,070
and keep an eye on that day or keep that

600
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,650
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a moment because I'm</font>

601
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,210
confused by something myself this one

602
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,580
that particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> crystallographer victims</font>

603
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,890
get files back for free this is the

604
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">story i'll just let you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

605
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,470
really this was obviously just finished

606
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,940
three years ago and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was simple</font>

607
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the game of his youth group who were</font>

608
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,040
distributing crypto Locker they were

609
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,290
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a few people came together</font>

610
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,850
they took that controller crystal of him

611
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,850
and as a result one of the things they

612
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:53,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">did they publicly and fire i did a</font>

613
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:55,800
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> portal which you go there and and</font>

614
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,920
unlock yourself as it were so yeah good

615
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,889
idea this is six of april 2014 i went to

616
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">this on monday so that's actually a</font>

site offline and great thanks very much

620
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:15,570
for that so i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire I and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fox</font>

621
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:21,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">i see and this was actually one I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

622
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:23,040
six of<font color="#E5E5E5"> August 2014 if I spotted this</font>

623
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,050
afternoon I need to raise them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

624
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,970
the love of providing decryption

625
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,040
solutions the cryptolocker there is no

626
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,900
different we just continued that website

627
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,790
in its association decryption service on

628
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,480
the same day I need to turn that with

629
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:38,460
them squared edges before yeah but that

630
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,940
was one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't last very long and</font>

631
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I went to to them and foxy Fox YT said</font>

632
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,230
as cryptolocker was no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

633
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,090
spread usage of the service with

634
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,080
decreased because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan cryptolocker is</font>

635
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,600
quite often use any type of ransomware

636
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">its they decided to quit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people come</font>

637
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,679
in they're trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves out</font>

638
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,409
wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and various other types of malware</font>

639
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,210
but am I said to not give victims of

640
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,370
future rounds or infections false hope

641
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">by coming to our website bloody harsh</font>

642
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:12,000
isn't it so and the antics one this came

643
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,860
out 2016 no more ransom if this has been

644
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,330
backed by government law enforcement a

645
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,909
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enders a lot of Industry people</font>

646
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,280
behind this my only concern is it turns

647
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,560
out and one day justice get discontinued

648
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm waiting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this whole post some</font>

649
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,770
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> melba ties me because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

650
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,199
they'll be all sore but a lot of people

651
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing good things yeah you look on it</font>

652
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,950
but my concern is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

653
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,780
are seeing this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big blast</font>

654
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,120
of information in<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one week which</font>

655
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,840
we call cybersecurity awareness week

656
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,979
sponsored by whoever and disappears and

657
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,409
people look at it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I forget all</font>

658
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,500
about it and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove the</font>

659
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,270
people scare about it by doing this poll

660
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,280
this was bit of fun we had for Christmas

661
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of my marketing teams she said can</font>

662
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,580
you cooking up some questions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> polls</font>

663
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,770
so I just thought what was launched and

664
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,139
also look at that train I'm stone I just

665
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,220
rearranged the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twain I'm</font>

666
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,170
sitting that what it's called as he

667
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoped some of the joking 114 people</font>

668
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:05,250
voted on this the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one good at math</font>

669
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,930
vertical<font color="#CCCCCC"> extender 114 were right the</font>

670
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,000
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean your laptop ram somewhere</font>

671
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,110
beyond so if anyone see a lot of

672
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,880
students in the room she want to create

673
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,620
a ransomware solution if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome</font>

674
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,980
to have that for free I've created it

675
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:19,199
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it away but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

676
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,360
it's pretty it's pretty serious actually

677
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these sort of things happened in</font>

678
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,310
our little<font color="#E5E5E5"> info security bubbles so</font>

679
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,139
consider running well under time and I'm

680
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,570
nearly done so let go back to the bar

681
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,220
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah with ransomware effectively</font>

682
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,340
people are kind of throwing money away

683
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,890
you know it it's cheap to make it's

684
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,199
cheap to distribute but it's very very

685
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,680
effective and those who are affected get

686
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,990
get locked down pretty straight away<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

687
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,250
in conclusion really you know the

688
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,690
problem is getting worse it's not

689
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's out there kind</font>

690
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of saying let's try and actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and to</font>

691
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,300
do this nice to think to the bottom here

692
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,240
there needs to be better URL filtering

693
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,649
attachment blocking if anyone here is

694
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,360
here at the tone looking to business

695
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,160
ideas upon actually leave your things

696
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,729
you can build I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

697
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font>

698
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,260
this industry could do is actually is

699
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,370
actually better URL filtering attachment

700
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,810
blocking<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things that the business</font>

701
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,139
could use to achieve stock mounts and

702
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,240
