00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,000
years which was a rather interesting

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,780
experience because about decade ago the

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,460

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,230
completely failed and everyone who's a

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,570
customer that bank lost their money and

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,760
as a result the payments industry the

done to prevent this from being a

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,860
problem what's being done to make sure

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,340
that we

around 2005-2006 all the major card

the idea behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> these Sanders is that if</font>

you're making a device to accept credit

cards or your emergent is accepting

60
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,340

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,630
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple you just separate</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">proper security precautions when</font>

91
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,920
accepting credit cards and this is even

92
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,850
a problem with major companies where

93
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,798
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the largest chains in the</font>

department store broke the one rule and

96
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:06,760
they put their card machines on the same

97
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,400
network as their HVAC systems so someone

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to break in to their HIV</font>

network using contractor<font color="#CCCCCC"> fidesz</font>

100
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,260
and was then able to install malware

101
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:22,150
onto the card terminals but of course

102
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,370
not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hope is lost because when</font>

103
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:29,370
people fail us we can use computers

104
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,690
right so in order to describe the

105
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,180
typical way that card payments are

106
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,100
processed I want you all to imagine that

107
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,880
you're at McDonald's you're hungry and

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,400
you need to quickly pay so great reach

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,669
into your pants you plug your wallet and

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,138
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow your heart before you would</font>

111
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,940

<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the cardholder was definitely</font>

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:11,169
later but your card also hopefully has

one of these and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to understand</font>

IBM took a bit a cassette tape paste it

123
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,880
on to a card and realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can</font>

store data on this card and the state it

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,950
could be read by machines this card had

126
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,830
the magnetic stripe on the front and I

127
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,050
only had one track whereas modern debit

128
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,440
cards and credit cards usually have two

129
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,849
tracks might have three on the first

130
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,630
track you'll have information that looks

131
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:47,500
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you have a card number</font>

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,320
anywhere on the card you also have the

second track which stores similar

143
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,540
information doesn't store the cardholder

144

name this is technically everything that

145
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,100
you need to actually process the card

146
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,340
payment because you have the same card

the card terminal will look at the first

151
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,820
few digits of the card number so if you

152
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,890
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this table you can see that for</font>

153
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,730
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> visa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cards start with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

154
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,979
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after it determines what card</font>

155
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,140
networks the card belongs to it can use

156
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,750
the following five digits to figure out

157
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,750
what bank the card belongs to so in this

158
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:01,370
example any visa card that starts with a

159
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,850
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 46 58 59 belongs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barclays and</font>

160
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,350
as a debit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card I also mentioned a</font>

161
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,230
service code being encoded at the

162
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,830
magnetic stripe data and essentially

163
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service code defines is what</font>

164
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,510
rules the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminals should take</font>

165
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,660
into account when it goes to actually

166
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,030
process the card so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why when you</font>

167
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to swipe any of your debit or credit</font>

168
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,789
cards it will tell you know please use

169
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,440
the chin this is how your bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> lets the</font>

170
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,300
card terminal know that a jip is

171
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,800
available it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard lets the card</font>

172
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,330
terminal know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're allowed to</font>

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,150
use the card internationally not what

174
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,820
you're allowed to use cash back but as

175
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:44,510
you can see these are pretty limited

176
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,849
rules that can be taken into account

177
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,460
here the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

178
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,640
this is a magnetic stripe you can do

179
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,890
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like with it so this is a</font>

180
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,800
device created by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sammy the guy who's</font>

181
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,460
behind the Sammy warm that took over my

182
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,980
space of decade ago and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

183
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,568
held up to a magnetic stripe card reader

184
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,039
it replaced the

185
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,779
information there's also a more

186
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,628
commercial product available which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

187
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:17,759
the coin which does basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

188
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,889
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just replays the magnetic stripe</font>

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,819
information so you can combine multiple

190
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:26,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">cards into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one so because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

191
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,979
direct control over what information is

192
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:32,729
on the magnetic stripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can trust it</font>

193
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:35,789
at all and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your make blindly trust</font>

194
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,250

200
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,589
forth and as a result doing offline

201
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,810
transactions is quite dangerous with a

202
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,100
magnetic stripe card because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,008
assurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that card actually</font>

205
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,880

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:10,319
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information on the card</font>

207
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,350
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd like so finally you can't</font>

208
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:16,769
do an offline transaction so how then

209
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,920
does an online transaction work again

210
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,500
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> McDonald's you swipe</font>

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,209
your card and the card terminal talks to

212
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,370
a company called an<font color="#CCCCCC"> enquiring</font>

213
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,229
institution and this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a company</font>

214
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,149
that the emergence signs up with who

215
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,160
will usually provide the card terminal

216
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,319
and is in charge of maintaining

217
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,660
relationship Visa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mastercard so on and</font>

218
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:38,399
so forth and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> parting a being</font>

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,410
wearing institutional letting go on and

220
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,439
ask the issuing institution whether it's

221
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to process the card so this will be</font>

your bank or Building Society whoever

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gave you a bit of plastic then</font>

224
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,670
the issuing institution comes back says

225
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,490
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine and provides an</font>

226
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,969
authorization number and the

227
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,430
authorization number is an IOU from the

228
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,800
issuing institution promising<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

later on

233
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:19,089
usually about 9pm either the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same day or</font>

the next day the car general will upload

and claim this money back then the

did indeed authorize these transactions

241
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,679
and it'll pay out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money which then</font>

gets paid out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the merchant at the</font>

a contactless symbol on it or your phone

simple of cases the issue still has a

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,910
lot of flexibility for temp you can see

343
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a language preference</font>

355
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,760
an example of an Italian<font color="#E5E5E5"> debit card that</font>

356
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,820
has both a bank oh man application as

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,040
well as a master application and

358
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,930
essentially when you use a card in Italy

359
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,030
it will prefer the local network<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,650
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cheaper for the merchant but</font>

when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the card abroad it'll just</font>

365
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,930
more complicated example it's a german

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,668
the terminal also goes ahead and checks

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,149
for this

453
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:48,969
this could include things like whether

to figure out yes this is a card that

that we had with magnetic stripe cards

00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:05,320
introduced where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal asks the</font>

card to sign around a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

481
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,070
public a private key that only the card

was then signed by the issuing

institution and by the card network the

485
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:20,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">terminal is able to make sure that guess</font>

486
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,609
is is a card that hasn't been cloned

487
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,139
because it's aware of this private key

488
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,178
the problem is that dynamic data sent

489
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,809
occasion does it prevent man in the

allows you to be assured<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a</font>

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,070
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> any degrees and certainty as to</font>

495
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,610
whether the actual transaction is being

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,269
tampered with and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

497
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,748
is that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a modified card any</font>

00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:55,330
card terminal and the modified card will

499
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:58,389
say yes that's fine stay offline this is

500
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,119
a small enough transaction I went online

<font color="#E5E5E5">cardholder and then when the card</font>

503
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:09,700
terminal goes to actually collect this

out on that money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at this point the</font>

510

513
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:37,269
authentication tries to fix this problem

514
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:39,700
by combining dynamic data authentication

515
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,039
with the actual cryptogram that's used

<font color="#E5E5E5">to sign into the transactions try to</font>

prevent this information from being

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,590
modified while the transaction is being

519
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,259
authorized and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the MV</font>

520
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,299
is that these are all extensions to the

521
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,309
specification so there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

522
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:00,460
guarantee that every part of you have

523
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,590
these however most cards issued within

524
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,049
Europe will support combined data

525
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:09,070
authentication as almost terminals

526
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:11,679
support it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so once the cardia has been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">between</font>

535
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,039
what you'll usually see in Europe and is

536
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,450
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind chip and pin or cards</font>

537
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,009
that are signature preferring which is

538
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,509
more common in the Americas where you

539
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:38,210
still have to sign even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you've</font>

00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:40,519
inserted the carving and regardless of

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,649
which verification method was selected

542
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,809
you'll see this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> printed on the</font>

543
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:47,149
receipt so going clockwise is a

544
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,710
contactless transaction which obviously

545
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:51,889
doesn't have any sort of cardholder

546
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,279
verification just goes through neatly a

547
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:57,619
card performed using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. debit card</font>

548
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,360
which is verified using a signature as

549
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:01,549
well as they finally a transaction

550
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,928
performed using a British debit card

551
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:07,809
which was verified using a pen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

552
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:10,369
is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a cardholder</font>

553

verification method list from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font>

554
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:15,139
debit card and because this is a

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,940
signature preferring card this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a card</font>

556
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:20,240
that place is fairly strict conditions

557
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,240
on when a pen can actually be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

558
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,940
in theory the idea is that whenever

559
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,559
you're at an unattended machine so for

560
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,990
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> a self-checkout machine at a</font>

supermarket ticket machine at a train

562
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,879
station the card will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's no</font>

563
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:39,769
human around so simply asked for the pen

564
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:42,590
in practice however<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't really</font>

565
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:44,360
actually work out when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've tried using</font>

566
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,789
this particular card for instance that

<font color="#CCCCCC">self at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tesco self checkout machines</font>

568
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:53,419
I get a very confused attendant coming

569
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:56,299
over as they have to watch me sigh my

570
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,799
heart which was particularly fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

571
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:59,830
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the attendant simply didn't</font>

supports it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason behind this</font>

585
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is because there are some terminals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

586
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:39,370
simply lack the pin pad<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is becoming</font>

587
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:42,729
the case in United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and slightly</font>

588
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:46,989
cheaper as most cards will prefer a

589
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,990
signature anyway but in addition to that

590
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,870
we can also see that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

591
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:55,990
instances where of him can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it can</font>

592
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:59,889
use for this card in first instance as a

593
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:03,279
clean text and verification or as a

594
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:06,729
third CBM as a in ciphered pen verified

595
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,490
online and British banks tend to prefer

596
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">an offline parent than verification so</font>

597
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,809
that if you accidentally enter the wrong

598
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,519
number your card immediately comes back

599
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,860
and says no that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pin and</font>

600
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,779
gives you a chance to try again<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

601
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,939
having to wait a couple of seconds for

602
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,889
the car channel to go online ask your

603
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,419
bank whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct pin for</font>

604
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:28,120
to ultimately come back and say no

605
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:30,809
that's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the problem</font>

606
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,840
with this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's offline</font>

607
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:38,379
the terminal has to transmit the pin to

608
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the card in plain text so you can place</font>

609
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,779
a small intercepting device in between

610
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,090
the card terminal and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card and be</font>

611
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,120
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull these pens off of the</font>

612
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:52,029
carbon<font color="#CCCCCC"> in addition to that if you use</font>

613
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,559
offline pin verification there's no way

614
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:57,370
to check whether the pin was actually

615
00:26:53,559 --> 00:27:00,250
verified or not the card says it would

616
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,340
like the pin to be verified<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the card</font>

617
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:07,690
terminal issues a verified pin command

618
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:10,000
but although the card changes the state

619
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the transaction and internally</font>

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,790
marched out the pins been verified in

621
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:15,460
this

622
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:19,360
there's no way for the card terminal to

623
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,700
actually check that so this attack

624
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,679
essentially you have an intercepting

625
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,170
device between the bank card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

626
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,870
terminal and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terminal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asks the</font>

627
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,570
car to verify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin the Interceptor</font>

628
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,219
devices yes that pens fine and it tells

629
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,280
the banker that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a signature was used</font>

630
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,710
instead and the receipt will list that a

631
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,129
pen was verified when in fact it wasn't

632
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,090
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inquirer be none the wiser will</font>

633
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,990
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a signature</font>

634
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,760
transaction so fine let's let's assume

635
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,670
that we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

636
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything worked hopefully we use</font>

637
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,190
an online and verification for example

638
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,970
so next up the terminal work performed

639
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:05,320
risk management assessment and it will

640
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:08,110
use the this uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration that is</font>

641
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">put in by be terminal vendor or by the</font>

642
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:13,959
merchant and this is where it starts to

643
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,300
figure out how much how much risk is

644
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,680
involved in this room which then uses to

645
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,899
figure out whether it's okay with

646
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,970
staying offline or whether it just

647
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,440
immediately wants to go online and the

648
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,630
certain factors that it keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> into count</font>

649
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,520
into account here or how many

650
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,720
transactions has it been since the card

651
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:34,450
last one online how much the purchase is

652
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,900
for is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local card is this a card</font>

653
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,390
issued in another country in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

654
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,880
that the cardigan also signaled to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,870
terminal if you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pop-up please</font>

656
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,790
immediately fail the transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

657
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,189
this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of what's used to</font>

658
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,970
enforce international transactions being

659
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:57,450
allowed or being forbidden and is also

660
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,919
partly used to enforce expert

661
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,360
so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terminal makes its</font>

662
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,460
assessment based off of all these

663
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,039
factors it generates its terminal

664
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,629
verification results and it makes its

665
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:09,820
own assessment as to whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

666
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:11,799
like to attempt to say offline or

667
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,100
whether it wants to immediately then go

668
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,720
online it passes this information on to

669
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,719
the card along with a card data

670
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">processed list reply which then allows</font>

671
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,440
the card to make its own independent

672
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessment it tells the card what the</font>

transaction amount is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">stay complacent on so forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

675
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:34,119
step allows the car to override the

678
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:43,480
and basically when eternal requests

say no I'm rejecting that transaction or

fine go online it cannot force the

assessment that what conclusion the card

three cryptograms over to the terminal

<font color="#CCCCCC">and sometimes these can be kind of hard</font>

692
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,539
to find they're not usually printed on

693

698
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,820
offline and then you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,860
explicitly noted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seat next to the</font>

approved offline that fine we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish</font>

703
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,269
off there but if you Carter the terminal

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,219
decided that they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go online</font>

705
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:55,179
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need</font>

706
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:59,350
go online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do some more stuff to have</font>

707
00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:01,299
this transaction go through and the card

708
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,370
terminal those online goes through the

709
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,129
usual steps of asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the acquiring</font>

710
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,469
institution to authorize that card who

711
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,309
then goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the issuing institution</font>

712
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:15,340
and after the card terminal receives a

713
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:17,918
reply back the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal will send its</font>

715
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,740
allows the card to reset some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

716
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,600
counter so this allows the car to reset

717
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,630
for instance that can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

718
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,530
transactions that have been performed

transaction at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the issuer</font>

721
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,809
also has the option of updating the

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,840
information on the card and one case

723
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:43,120
right personally seen this use was where

724
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,459
i had a current account with a bank and

725
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,840
then opened a savings account with that

726
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">bank and the issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Miriam used a issuer</font>

727
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,120
script in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell my card that I</font>

728
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,770
now had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> savings account available to</font>

729
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,360
withdraw from so when I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to cash</font>

730

00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,219
options as opposed to just one and then

732
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:08,860
finally you're told to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

736
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:20,500
in an assumed hostile environment and

737
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,559
although it originally didn't do that

738
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">much for the merchant later versions now</font>

739
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,590
do actually have that available

740
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,780
merchants do having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reasonable idea as</font>

741
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:35,620
to whether a transaction is indeed

742
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,210
genuine or not but we still have all of

743
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">these factors</font>

744
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,399
issues for example although the

745
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,979
cardholder verifications method list may

746
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,428
be signed you can't actually force the

747
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,490
signatures to on that list to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

749
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,169
to the EMV protocol there so cards out

00:32:53,649 --> 00:33:00,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">there whose car builder verification</font>

751
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:03,490
methods lists aren't funny so if you

752
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:06,010
have a bank card that only allows for in

753
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,289
ciphered pin verification but you really

754
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:11,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that pen you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

755
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:13,480
downgrade the cardola verification

756
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:18,309
method list to allow plain text and

757
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,279
verification and and like what you see

758
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:23,799
similar and contactless one of the

759
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,679
required parts of the contactless

760
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:30,370
specification is a magnetic emulation

761
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:33,730
mode and essentially this uses the

762
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:36,639
transaction counter as well as a private

763
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:40,299
key stored within the card to generate

764
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,000
different CTV's that are then put into

765
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:46,149
this magnetic stripe the track

766
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,240
information and because this is required

767
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:51,939
in all of the cards you could very well

768
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,600
simply ask a card to sign a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

769
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:58,600
transactions and then replay<font color="#E5E5E5"> is later on</font>

770
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:02,199
now luckily most cards all cards issued

771
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,760
in Europe do support the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMV mode to</font>

775
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:13,240
today but it would and the issuer is

776
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,609
told whether you have a terminal that

777
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,618
supports the DMV mode and obviously they

778
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:19,480
know whether your card does but for a

while<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of issues would not actually</font>

someone's bank card the problem with

808
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,660
this is that since 2009 banks have been

809
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:34,000
legally required in the United Kingdom

810
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,520
to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were the person</font>

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,339
this can prove difficult to Jackson

demonstrate when the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know</font>

the card to be tampered with as is the

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,950
case with the

that I described<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the car</font>

distillate a signature transaction took

819
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,919
place when and when the chart terminal

820
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:58,799
is told that a thin transaction took

821
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,509
place and it's certainly impossible to

822
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:02,009
prove this with a contactless card<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

there simply is no car builder

really an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when the Andy</font>

moment that's frustrating was that

entirely hiding from the chart i wanted

867
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,400
to show right so you can see that was a

868
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,368
massive spike in card-not-present fraud

869

after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the liability shift which was when</font>

used a card when they check out their

872

store but they didn't Samaritan and

873
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,940
fraud occurred as a reserve that they're

liable for it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we see</font>

00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">3d secure which basically tries to</font>

879
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,609
provide merchants with the mechanism so

880
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,769
they can offload the cardholder

881
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,650
verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the issue institution</font>

882
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:42,868
and the in theory this is great because

883
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,970
the issuing institution has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font>

884
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:47,039
methods available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the</font>

885
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,779
cardholder is indeed they claim to be

886
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:53,400
they could send you SMS they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

887
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to input a one-time password</font>

888
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,560
Chris Young personal information and the

889
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,350
way this protocol works is that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

890
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,540
server side the merchant asks the

891
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:05,520
interop domain which will be visa or

892
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,040
mastercard or american express where the

893
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,420
card network is whether the particular

894
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:14,730
part is enrolled in 3d secure then the

895
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,940
card number it forwards that on to the

896
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:20,880
issuing institution who will then reply

897
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,370
yes you can send<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer over to</font>

898
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,680
this address and we'll verify that

899
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:28,650
because this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is indeed for they</font>

900
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,259
claim to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at this point the universe</font>

901
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,030
where is then sent over to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issuers</font>

902
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,590
domain and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen this if</font>

903
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,710
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying something online and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

904
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">little pop-up or a little frame you know</font>

905
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,320
with your bank's logo in it and after

906
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:45,120
your big verifies that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are claiming</font>

907
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,240
to be they send you back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the merchant</font>

908
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,190
and say yes they are indeed this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

909
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,859
indeed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cardholder feel free to</font>

910
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:56,040
proceed with the transaction this is

911
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,900
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> in theory but as hopefully</font>

912
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,290
although in practice this doesn't really

913
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">work out because quite frequently you</font>

914
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,500
got this screen and then the

915
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,750
transactions immediately approved and

916
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,520
you're not ask for anything or if you

917
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,360
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked for information you're asked</font>

918
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,460
for a lot of personal vehicles on a

919
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,920
random website where you might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

920
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,530
be shown what domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> this form is on and</font>

921
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,740
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are shown the URL for this</font>

922
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:28,110
form I don't recognize secure sweet met

923
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,200
and so fine you know you would think

924
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know so banks might contract</font>

925
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,180
out doing 3d secure to some other

926
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:38,280
third-party organization and some things

927
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,529
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this infrastructure on</font>

928
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,330
their own domain so if you know in the

929
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Barclays here they actually have</font>

930
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">this interest</font>

932
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:52,319
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> barclays don't actually ask you for</font>

933
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:54,000
information and even though they have it

934
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,560
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own domain they're still</font>

935
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,619
outsourcing it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discreet</font>

936
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,720
company so even though issuing

937
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,420
institutions have the opportunity to

938
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,879
actually use 3d secure to properly

939
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,420
verify customers they just outsource

940
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">itano saying don't do anything and</font>

941
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultimately insurance covers all of these</font>

942
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,570
gaps that are left<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind as a result of</font>

943
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,490
decades of backwards compatibility we as

944
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,990
customers aren't immediately hit by

945
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,879
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things because if there's a</font>

946
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,229
fraudulent transaction on our cars our

947
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,140
bank will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money back</font>

948
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,390
but we see higher prices and things and

949
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,879
higher credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> visas are resolved</font>

950
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">with these extra insurance fees thank</font>

951
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,180
you very much
