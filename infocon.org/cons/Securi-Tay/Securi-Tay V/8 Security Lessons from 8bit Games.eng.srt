knows gabbing knows that he's an

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,589
outrageous hipster so when I thought

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,789
initially he was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me to</font>

14
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:44,998
present this through the medium of

00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:48,179
contemporary dance but no he's given me

16
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:51,510
some slides regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 the mysteries of</font>

gaming 8-bit style so Gavin blessing I'm

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,839
sure if he was here<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would he'd be</font>

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a much more fluent top of this but</font>

21
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,158
he's briefing me he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go</font>

22
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:07,080
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk to them about what we do</font>

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunately I'll back you up with</font>

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,250
some space invaders so clearly what he's

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,740
up he's trying to attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring out</font>

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,090
here is no the attack path because what

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,829
we're going to talk about through the

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">various lessons that we've learned over</font>

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,839
the years through observing space

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,250
invaders is that attack vectors and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">commedia to be as equally as tricky and</font>

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,570
there are a number of lessons which he's

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Illustrated quite cleverly with similar</font>

34
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,538
advanced graphics and but what he's

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,079
talking about is is the attack path now

36
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,590
he's abstracted this because Upton when

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,020
presentations are done like this

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,369
somebody's going to trot out here and go

39
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,770
cyber kill chain you all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that</font>

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,329
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stunned an abstraction</font>

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,179
here to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a way of saying it</font>

42
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,499
doesn't really matter whether there's a

43
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:54,960
somebody's on cyber ninja on one of your

44
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,259
users and track them down to every

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,800
social media nodes and

46
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,950
God and set about putting some very

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,539
plausible content some collateral for

48
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,760

going to be through a sightless owned or

through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine or whatever there</font>

51
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,589
are commonalities which we to be aware

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,109
of and this is 101 stuff for us but it's

53
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,090
surprising my job is a pre sales

54
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,000
engineer and I have to follow sales

55
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,910
people around into meetings with some

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,760
very senior guys in enterprise for whom

57
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,340
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because as far as they're</font>

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,679
concerned their job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have shopping</font>

59
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">lists and to looking a top right hand</font>

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,930
side of the Gartner quadrant to figure

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,290
out which one to buy they don't have an

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,240
appreciation but layers in defense are

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,130
all about understanding where the danger

64
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the threat is they think the</font>

65
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,040
security is obtainable through shopping

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,920
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the vendor community</font>

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,109
doesn't a thing to disabuse of that at

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,929
the sales level and it falls to the poor

69
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-sales engineer to kind of pick the</font>

70
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,450
threads up and help to weave something

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,480
which is secure out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the random</font>

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">collection of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've bought</font>

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,160
including hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stock of course</font>

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,269
so being aware of attack paths and being

75
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,920
aware that there are some inherent

76
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,640
limitations to the technologies that we

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,579
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy so the reps intelligence very</font>

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,559
useful and a very handy community of

79
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,860
research out there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is providing a</font>

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,530
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention about command and control</font>

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,720
networks I piece of poor reputation bad

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,870
URLs etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these fees</font>

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,489
however if a cyber criminal organization

84
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,670
is targeting your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their spent</font>

85
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,830
hours and hours tracking someone down to

construct<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world's best phishing</font>

87
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,450
attack the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing they're going to</font>

88
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,540
do is have that attack go back to a

89
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,339
control node in China or Russia they're

90
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,450
going to spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a brand new AWS that's</font>

91
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,780
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cleaning and have no history</font>

92
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,459
so we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware that the wrecked</font>

93
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,840
intelligence is not the be-all and

94
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,239
end-all no matter what a threat

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,609
intelligence vendor might say and and

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,920
tenable has threat intelligence built in

97
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,829
so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dissing the opposition</font>

98
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,070
here I am being aware that some features

99
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:18,660
of some security platforms are only that

100
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:22,659
just some features<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,440
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish godless in gathering</font>

102
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,470
with his missus even animated so he's

103
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the advantages of building</font>

104
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,120
a suitable security posture for your

105
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,369
organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is about</font>

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,720
understanding where the weak points are

107
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,580
in your network and one of the things

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our bag of tricks that</font>

109
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,380
we can stitch together to make the bad

110
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,630
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have as hard a time as possible</font>

111
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,130
securing foothold so the guy on the left

112
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,700
has got great big gaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going the</font>

113
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,700
right nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as an appearing so</font>

114
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,800
what we're saying is identify and

115
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,960
prioritize the treatment of weaknesses

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,090
and what are the techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that what are the things</font>

118
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,190
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we get our customers</font>

119
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,060
our enterprises to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

120
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,010
is work to do beyond deploying XYZ

121
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,070
product and how do we have an integrated

122
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">system of defense which and which alerts</font>

us to the possibilities of being owned

this really stood up the deck for me

when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was presenting it because they'd</font>

defending you against anything it's wild

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,049
before the year 2000 ridiculous things

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,780
like default SNMP

munity<font color="#CCCCCC"> streamers totally ridiculous and</font>

143
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,309
that's costing enterprises huge amounts

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,789
entertained and seduced by these new

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,710
technologies and that's endemic in the

151
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:28,050
industry we like our toys so how do we

152
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,000
reaffirm that that in that tendency and

153
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,590
something more productive how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

things well and to do it consistently

157
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,378
and again back to a big gaming so we're

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,560
the morning walk into the office they're

a switch goes off in their head and

173
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,060
that's for a number of reasons they've

174
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,440
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very simple domestic</font>

re-educate normal will be well well

179
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,930
sadly no because something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has</font>

180
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,759
happened they've got a false sense of

181
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,830
security they've walked into a very

182
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,500
complicated environment and they feel

183
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,349
safe and this is where the weakness to

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,389
to to the attack for the users occurs

185
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,770
and gavins point is it's a bit like

phones are they famous did you check is

203
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,958
there anything else in those

204
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,270
environments too hard let's not go there

205
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,949
let's focus on the service let's focus

on the data center that's where all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

peoples environment is owned you can say

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,070
goodbye to everything else because

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,610
they're inside the printer so have a

211
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,610
plan helps lagging a bit have a plan for

<font color="#E5E5E5">some good practices there but that was</font>

in the day when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would walk into</font>

talk a very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> story about</font>

and protect them in this scary landscape

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:41,489
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many flash applications are we</font>

what that corporate landscape still is

257
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,490
so yeah we should kill flash anyone got

still the possibility that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your 10</font>

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,550
put a layer of knowledge into your

291
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,980
security practice and things will

292
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,660
automatically start to get better there

293
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,580
won't be perfect but at least you

294
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,469
haven't got great gaping holes at the

295
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,810
foundational level and that's doing

296
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,790
things like auditing new machines how do

password complexity rules applicable to

299
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,110
all machines you have to go and check

300
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,300
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so there's a theory that no</font>

301
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,100
we can cook<font color="#E5E5E5"> corners we can sample well</font>

302
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,810
that's fine but footholds out there for

303
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,170
somebody on one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these machines sooner</font>

or later that<font color="#E5E5E5"> telnet listener is running</font>

to know you've been consistent and if

you're finding out to do this how do you

go about just providing information up

got a parachute or prepared to join you

00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:04,460
and put their hands in their pockets you

574
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,289
can build up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bridge bridge the chasm</font>

575
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,330
and I can carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> on running across I'm</font>

576
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,440
feelin that was exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gavin was</font>

577
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,769
trying to say with that graphic

578
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,049
disappeared so that's about not saying

579
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:16,729
no it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabling so recognizing</font>

580
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:18,440
that the enterprise security landscape

581
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:20,539
has changed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all recognition from</font>

582
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,479
when these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in charge when they</font>

583
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,549
first came into them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run into IP</font>

584
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,779
networking back in the 90s they're now

585
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,759
being faced with things I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

586
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,559
understand the challenges that are that

587
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,049
are too big but they've now also got to

588
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,149
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say okay fine we'll be your</font>

589
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:37,700
partners in taking this risk rather the

590
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:40,158
stopping and the other side of that is

591
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,330
that we've now got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them stop</font>

592
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,090
chasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghosts</font>

593
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:49,320
yeah we have a seance there nobody liked

594
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,240
the idea is that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be effective</font>

595
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,029
in what we're doing in terms of business

596
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,799
rather than why don't you if I rewind

597
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier part</font>

598
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this is being seduced into thinking</font>

599
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,519
that if I spend lots of money on sexy

600
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:05,219
sandbox stuff if I've got the mail

601
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,690
platform on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rails then everything's</font>

602
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,909
going to be fine and just focus on those

603
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,070
shopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists which is really nice for</font>

604
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:12,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys in big enterprises because that's</font>

605
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,779
the way of it it's done they've got

606
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,029
colleagues who in who are looking after

607
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,370
your ERP who are just basically writing

608
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:23,789
check after check to sa p they've got

609
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,729
people at the CRM level writing checks

610
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:34,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Salesforce or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft stupid and</font>

611
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,850
seriously dynamics terrific but the

612
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:39,539
point is that they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

613
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,370
surrounded by peer organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

614
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,559
spending and they've been putting they

615
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,689
make they have skills which which align

616
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,730
they are because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do own budgets and</font>

617
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,399
people who own budgets go shopping and

618
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,130
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop that mentality and the</font>

619
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:54,330
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be responsible for</font>

620
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:58,889
for understanding that a shopping list

621
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:01,740
is not a security process so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

622
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:03,570
this the final slide understand the

623
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,490
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> my client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side but</font>

624
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,110
finally is where we get to is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

625
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:11,909
understand what's needed rather than

626
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:14,158
what's wanted and an act accordingly so

627
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:15,690
I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to look for time</font>

628
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually I know that I'm probably</font>

629
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,909
going a bit fast but Sir gives us some

630
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,190
time for some questions and answers and

631
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:25,559
things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font>

632
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,110
summarizes the message that i was sent

633
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,269
along to provide understand the attack

634
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,668
path look at the end going to know what

635
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,350
the endpoints are be able to say with

636
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,880
the vendor percent certainty eighty

637
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,620
percent of my machines have been scanned

638
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can blind or whatever those s</font>

639
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,879
airlines are that you can construct

640
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,070
reduce your attack surface manage out

641
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,190
the legacy etc nothing here is

642
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,059
contentious or run or problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

643
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,720
thankfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all being brought to you</font>

644
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:55,749
through the means of retro gaming icons

645
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,690
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that after half an hour of</font>

646
00:26:55,749 --> 00:27:00,370
rambling at you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gavin's content</font>

647
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,409
I'm hopefully giving you something

648
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's illustrative and talked about</font>

649
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:07,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">what Enterprise should be doing and some</font>

650
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:12,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pitfalls which they're facing and</font>

651
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:16,139
still subtly not accommodating so with

652
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,139
that do we have any questions
