1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:17,119
hey guys well so it's not we're talking

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post special today so we had a</font>

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,450
look at some secure messengers and the

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,980
first something about us we came along

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:32,180
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rihanna today my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> david this</font>

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,710
is christoph and we were studying we

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,300
made our bachelor's degree in IT

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,770
security at the University of Applied

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,599
fire in thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> burden and currently</font>

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,810
we're doing our master's degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,600
information security and since one and a

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:50,770
half a year we are working for a company

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,260
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sick in Derek in Vienna and</font>

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:58,670
mainly building pen testing and web

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,550
application security stuff so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:06,110
where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here is Vienna here is</font>

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:12,459
Sundberg is mostly with 50,000 people

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:18,350
and so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got sponsored from our</font>

19
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:22,939
university so we have to do this we're

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:25,908
about 2,500 students there the physical

21
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:29,568
department is very small so the bachelor

22
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:34,119
I think 200 people something the master

23
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:38,450
are only 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bachelor we have</font>

24
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:42,259
three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> focuses forensics</font>

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:45,969
networking and management either the

26
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,740
networking stuff IDK forensic stuff and

27
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:50,389
the bachelor lasts for three years and

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,199
after that you're a bachelor of science

29
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:58,350
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> information security master</font>

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,630
and master of science I didn't need more

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,059
info on this or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study at our</font>

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">University you can just have a look at</font>

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,199
our web web page but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now enough secure</font>

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,459
hasn't released yet we had a look at

35
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,230
five different messengers and

36
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,599
investigative different things all of

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,060
them provide the possibility to create

38
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,750
end-to-end encrypted communications or

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,150
chats and some of them provide the

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,370
possibility great and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group group</font>

41
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,489
chats as well but I will talk about this

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,980
later so the five messages 1 sep I

43
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:40,530
message telegrams signal and line and

44
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,790
now a short definition what means secure

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,860
to us so like I said before all of these

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,849
messengers have the possibility to

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,790
create and to an encrypted

48
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,420
communications so it was the number one

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,340
criteria for us to have a look at them

50
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:59,190
then is there a strong continues

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:05,130
state-of-the-art crypto or any we

52
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,569
recruit two algorithms in use do they

53
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,700
have the possibility to verify each

54
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,069
other so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very important thing I</font>

55
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,230
will talk about this later when it comes

56
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,869
to nine the middle attacks that you can

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,340
verify if the correct key was exchanged

58
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,889
with with each other the conversations

59
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,410
if they are and to end encrypted you

60
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:28,799
want to store them in securely so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypted on the device and are there</font>

62
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">any privacy issues so gets made a data</font>

63
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,720
leak is it possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to intercept it and</font>

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:42,420
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole context context of the of</font>

65
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,040
the client and so on yeah so we had five

66
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,510
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things which we were looking</font>

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,870
at jump some general stuff how many uses

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">do they have and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Crippler drawings</font>

69
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,970
are using are they using then about

70
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Antoine encryption I will</font>

71
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,840
explain shortly what's invented and

72
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,780
end-to-end encryption is and how it

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,700
works and what attack vectors are there

74
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,020
so especially man-in-middle-attacks then

75
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">christov we'll talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,920
hijacking possibilities so it's

77
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">impossible to hijack another account by</font>

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,190
intercepting phone calls or SMS messages

79
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:23,210
then about privacy so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible to</font>

80
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,810
get some contacts or meta data or who is

81
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">checking with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whom and so on and then</font>

82
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,970
last but not least the insecure

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,590
transmission in storage are there still

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,800
some communications which are

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,789
unencrypted by HTTP or something and how

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,170
is everything stored but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

87
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,670
start with the short history about

88
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:50,300
messaging and instant messaging so back

89
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:54,890
in 2011 and what's up was still

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:58,330
transmitting the converted text messages

91
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">by our plane so I'm critical HTTP</font>

92
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:06,849
everybody in the state had brought could

93
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:10,310
read and modify everything and then in

94
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,930
2012 they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok now let's switch to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t</font>

95
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:17,060
0 s and H<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS and so it was not long</font>

96
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,479
not longer unencrypted so it was

97
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,140
encrypted between the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> and server</font>

98
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:28,479
so it was not so easy to to intercept

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:34,070
but it was was still possible then in

100
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,380
2014 they discovered that what that is

101
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,460
not enforcing certificate pinning so

102
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,140
this means that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to</font>

103
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">install a trusted certificate on the</font>

104
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,800
client you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to intercept</font>

105
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:52,070
the messages so like you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,550
talk before every client or every

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,640
smartphone has a lot of trusted

108
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,340
certificate in fall and everybody of

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,590
everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

110
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,909
in there would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> two men in the</font>

111
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:11,560
middle that so then later this was quick

112
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:13,210
to quite quite fast by<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatsapp they</font>

113
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">added certificate pinning so this means</font>

114
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,979
that only the certificate of what set

115
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,960
itself is trusted and even if you

116
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,539
install some other and certificated will

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,620
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignored so this makes it very hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,930
men in the middle then as a as a search

119
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,470
party but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will talk about this in a</font>

120
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute so then this guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came I think</font>

121
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,410
everybody of me of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows him edward</font>

122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:40,990
snowed when<font color="#E5E5E5"> edward snowden revealed the</font>

123
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,810
prison program menu used to switch to

124
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,540
two alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> messengers so they moved</font>

125
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,210
from what's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Datagram or signal or</font>

126
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,389
something like that because yeah like

127
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,299
you know prism<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

128
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,820
servers and there is no end<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

129
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,139
encryption use the messages are normally

130
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,849
stored on<font color="#CCCCCC"> service and the NSA has access</font>

131
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:10,210
to to them and well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook bought</font>

132
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:13,120
whatsapp Facebook is in the prison

133
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,159
program so doing you when you think

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,780
about it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook bought whatsapp</font>

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,120
or whatsapp messages belong to to

136
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,719
facebook so they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to it</font>

137
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,479
and yeah they<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tattoo apps like</font>

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,080
kilogram no signal but for example

139
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,669
telegram got very popular through

140
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,550
through him because everybody switch did

141
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:39,250
it and now they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of users from</font>

142
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,780
whatsapp and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

143
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,990
telegram is not enforcing end-to-end

144
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,330
encryption so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the secret</font>

145
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:51,340
chat then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view user's telegram and a</font>

146
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:55,060
secret chat only only secret chats good

147
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,789
good yeah so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using secret</font>

148
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,400
chats if not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not better than than</font>

149
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,150
what's up because it's yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,479
encrypted between the clans so well so

151
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,799
that's it for history and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,568
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general stuff and</font>

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,710
how many years are there and about some

154
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:19,979
some cryptic issues so what's up the

155
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:27,508
most popular messenger out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

156
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:34,769
uses water locked yeah 1 billion active

157
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:38,120
users in 2016 now they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they partnered</font>

158
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,120
with with

159
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,069
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> departed with open whisper systems in</font>

160
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:56,730
2014 there is no official<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement of</font>

161
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:58,349
whatsapp since then it was announced on

162
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,199
the open whisper systems block that they

163
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,670
partnered with whatsapp to implement

164
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:07,019
end-to-end encryption like signal but

165
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever is still closed source and</font>

166
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:13,259
there is no Krypto documentation how it

167
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:17,069
works if it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> can signal you</font>

168
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:19,529
have no idea and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like that</font>

169
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:21,870
there are so-called securities

170
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:26,220
indicators in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new beta version of</font>

171
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:30,180
whatsapp and then you have a little lost

172
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,149
in the upper right corner where it says

173
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,519
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> this communication is end-to-end</font>

174
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,439
encrypted it seems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's only</font>

175
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible between Android devices and not</font>

176
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:43,290
between Android and iOS and we got no

177
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,819
information about group chats or so on

178
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,980
if group chats or end-to-end encrypted

179
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:54,689
or not so to sum this up still closed

180
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,579
software no idea what what crypto is in

181
00:09:54,689 --> 00:10:00,029
use so you would have to reverse

182
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:04,138
engineer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something then I want to</font>

183
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:06,709
talk about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> message and as default the</font>

184
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,389
default messaging application of iOS and

185
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:13,560
they have end-to-end encryption in use

186
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:15,839
for by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default so even for cool chest so</font>

187
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,888
I was quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> about surprised that even</font>

188
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:23,339
group chats are in China cryptic they

189
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:26,160
have 200k messages per minute per second

190
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:31,889
so because it's the default application

191
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,600
of iOS four for messaging and yeah the

192
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,000
crypto they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,819
documentation i will put these flights

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,879
later online so you can have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

195
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:45,449
those links there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security guide</font>

196
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:49,079
published on their on their website the

197
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:50,819
user to use strong eric r is a they use

198
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:56,910
elliptic curves with

199
00:10:50,819 --> 00:11:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">206 60 256-bit they use AES for</font>

200
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:05,969
symmetric encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CPR mode they</font>

201
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:10,529
use sha-1 for hashing that's maybe not

202
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,139
so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's just used for for just</font>

203
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,529
used or for integrity checking so you

204
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:21,119
hash hash the message and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you sign</font>

205
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:23,479
it with the elliptic curve key and then

206
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:27,660
that's appended to the tuna message and

207
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:31,049
it seems that they don't use perfect

208
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,899
forward secrecy because they support

209
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,970
that if the other party is not online

210
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:40,139
they have to deliver the messages later

211
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,489
on and if everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just throw a</font>

212
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,069
whale encroaching he would not be

213
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:46,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible to to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages later on</font>

214
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:51,238
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt</font>

215
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:53,160
it so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why they having</font>

216
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:56,819
implemented perfect forward secrecy

217
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,689
because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

218
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:03,719
about it telegram like I said before

219
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:06,089
very popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over what's up</font>

220
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,889
now they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 100 million active users</font>

221
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:14,970
per month it's not I'm to Kent and to

222
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:20,519
end encrypted petal fold so just the

223
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:24,629
secret check well telegram is owned<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

224
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,189
person called palo duro and the company

225
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:34,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">is based in russia and pavel durov makes</font>

226
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:36,868
money by selling private data so what

227
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,689
quite sure if telegram in its default

228
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:42,089
settings is better than water but the

229
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:43,769
future should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

230
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">now then work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cooked off the</font>

231
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:51,449
secret check and yeah you have some

232
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:55,720
homemade crypto stuff they said well we

233
00:12:51,449 --> 00:13:01,719
have PhDs maths PhDs and now we can make

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:05,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">crypto because we were great yeah he</font>

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,920
used RSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they used yes in some</font>

236
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">venir HEV mode which nobody uses and</font>

237
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,870
this mode has no integrity protection

238
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:19,569
like for example the GCM mode of<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS the</font>

239
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,899
use shall one for signing and now the

240
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">signing is really bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because they just</font>

241
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:28,000
hash it and then appended to the to the

242
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,120
message they don't sign it or something

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,189
and that's because yeah obscene domic

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,769
and then they encrypt so normally you

245
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:40,050
would encrypt den neck there's some

246
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:43,720
attacks on on this neck then encrypt

247
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:46,120
that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad and they have their own</font>

248
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,610
key derivation function a homemade

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:55,920
heater<font color="#CCCCCC"> iteration function where he</font>

250
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:59,709
creates<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IV's and the a es keys so no</font>

251
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:05,410
don't trade your crypto that's a number

252
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:07,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">one rule in trading implementing crypto</font>

253
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:13,719
don't create<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proto use approved</font>

254
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:17,639
crypto and state-of-the-art signal

255
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,879
that's this quite well they use the

256
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,089
axolotl not quite sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

257
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,500
axolotl a protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Moxie Marlinspike</font>

258
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,790
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't an decrypted by default</font>

259
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,829
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chats it's open source and</font>

260
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,699
they have 1 million downloads in google

261
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:39,099
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> store but i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how many</font>

262
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:40,660
active users they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think to use</font>

263
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,899
the goethe announced that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

264
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:48,100
billion active users per month maybe now

265
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:53,209
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think maybe 20 or 30 million who if</font>

266
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:57,910
you use a signal hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

267
00:14:53,209 --> 00:15:02,508
so yeah the crypto stuff the use

268
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:07,309
electric<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve diffie-hellman sha-256</font>

269
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:08,990
and a yes 256 in CPR and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in CBC mode he</font>

270
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:11,300
used two different modes because they

271
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,029
encrypt the message again on the server

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,300
so signal uses the lagoon Cloud

273
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:21,110
messaging to route the messages from the

274
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,729
internet and then you get the push

275
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,029
notification from from guru child

276
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,220
messaging and before the sigmas whoever

277
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:30,949
delivers the message to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good google</font>

278
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:36,410
cloud messaging they<font color="#CCCCCC"> encrypt it again in</font>

279
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:40,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in the SE kyung so then the last</font>

280
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:46,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">message shall line who he knows like</font>

281
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:49,369
some this yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe used in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan since</font>

282
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">October 2015 they have something called</font>

283
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:55,970
letter signing so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end to end</font>

284
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:00,199
encryption they had something like this

285
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:03,350
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now they call it lapis I now</font>

286
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:08,628
it's on and soda the lettuce I name is

287
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:11,949
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default and where the encrypted</font>

288
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:15,410
book chat seems to be in development<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

289
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:19,779
the documentation of the line ography

290
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:23,269
and everything is really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad so</font>

291
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:26,329
yeah that documentation they use some

292
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:29,809
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> solely use an electric ftp</font>

293
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">harmon aes but we're not quite sure if</font>

294
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:35,149
they have something like perfect forward

295
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,670
secrecy so not documented and all in all

296
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,889
it's very bad documented and that's the

297
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:44,059
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we haven't done further</font>

298
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:46,429
research on on the crypto offline maybe

299
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:52,790
the documentation will be updated soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

300
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope so but yeah so then the next</font>

301
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,559
chapter chapter and to an encryption how

302
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,790
is entering how how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work and</font>

303
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:04,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the tech like</font>

304
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:06,619
ters<font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alice and bob want</font>

305
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,650
to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other by ankle</font>

306
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,189
well an encrypted channel then they have

307
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to exchange some public keys first</font>

308
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,400
normally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a not secure channel so</font>

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,619
it's very internet or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something then the</font>

310
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,430
exchange the keys and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> both sides they</font>

311
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:28,520
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to calculate secrets and then</font>

312
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:31,130
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are able to exchange and</font>

313
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,530
to encrypted messages so that's the

314
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">basic principle of of end-to-end</font>

315
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:41,000
encryption so now if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack</font>

316
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,969
these things how could we do that well

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,570
then there comes Mallory Mallory has a

318
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,940
man in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle position and Alice</font>

319
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,669
wants to communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob they want</font>

320
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,700
to exchange messages public keys but

321
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:59,180
Mallory intercepted and says hey I'm Bob

322
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,220
and then Alice exchanges the keys with

323
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,900
Mallory and block exchanges the keys

324
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:08,210
with Mallory and then Mallory is able to

325
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,760
calculate the same secret as Alice and

326
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,330
Mallory is able to calculate the same

327
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,000
secret six<font color="#E5E5E5"> block and now Alice and Bob</font>

328
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,270
are exchanging end-to-end encrypted

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,840
messages between Alice and Natalie but

330
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:26,510
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are checking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

331
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:32,090
each other and they don't recognize

332
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:36,620
Mallory and that's exactly what happens

333
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:39,709
when so so some guys noticed this and

334
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,820
then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a was a blog entry in</font>

335
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:47,330
2013 that I message is vulnerable

336
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:51,500
vulnerable to such things and I will

337
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:56,929
explain in a minute why because yeah

338
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:00,440
that's a that's some from there from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

339
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,960
privacy page of Apple so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Apple</font>

340
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,020
has no way to decrypt

341
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,240
based on data when is in transit or

342
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">between devices we wouldn't be able to</font>

343
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,940
comply with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bio trap order even if we</font>

344
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:20,020
wanted to so think about this just

345
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:25,210
shortly well that's yes that's

346
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not true because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's that I</font>

347
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:32,080
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> line they all controls the the</font>

348
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,629
structure and they have no way to verify

349
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,129
the correct key was exchanged if the

350
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,169
correct public keys were exchanged so

351
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:46,270
when we go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to this to this</font>

352
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:50,559
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> here when Mallory is the I message</font>

353
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,658
server the I message server could switch

354
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,230
could just say yeah I give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> my keys</font>

355
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:58,779
and you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to verify if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice</font>

356
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:05,970
has the keys of Mallory also of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of</font>

357
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:05,970
the I message server or of ball so I

358
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:12,820
message and whatsapp line would be able

359
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to intercept you all the time and you</font>

360
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,240
have no way to verify it you have a way

361
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,570
to verify it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> closed software</font>

362
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,880
so who says that well I message or some

363
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,418
other messager just returns true all the

364
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">time if you verify the key with each</font>

365
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:36,429
other you would have to reverse engineer

366
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:39,070
or something so verify your contacts in

367
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:44,919
a via secure channel so meet each other

368
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:48,908
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> person and try to and verify that and</font>

369
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:53,320
how many caches in person or by a

370
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:56,649
another a secure channel so that was my

371
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,360
part and now I give the microphone to

372
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:01,149
Christophe and he will talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

373
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:05,219
account hijacking possibilities in all

374
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:05,219
of these numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

375
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,370
yeah I want to talk about how touching

376
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:20,330
so it is possible to hide check accounts

377
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,789
and yeah it is possible because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

378
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,309
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the registration process you have</font>

379
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:30,350
to enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone number and then you</font>

380
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:32,629
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret via SMS or a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> photo so if</font>

381
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,459
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to intercept is in this</font>

382
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,070
puzzle book if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

383
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,100
equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough money so by MC capture</font>

384
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,500
or used as a certain vulnerability which

385
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,010
I entered the phone of the phone number

386
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:50,179
of the victim intercept SMS and enter

387
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:56,570
the secret and can link this Twitter

388
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:59,299
account so very betting another<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

389
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:03,700
vector would be to explain this blog

390
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:07,309
post for example eros guide to a bar and

391
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,220
the guy leaves his phone on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

392
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,889
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the toilet so if you know the</font>

393
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">number the phone number of the sky just</font>

394
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:19,640
enter it during the registration process

395
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:23,299
for whatsapp then you can answer the

396
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,510
phone call as a phone of the guy ring so

397
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:29,120
accept a call get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret and</font>

398
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,610
entities secrets to your registration

399
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:39,610
and now you have to account of this guy

400
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:42,049
so so now the impact about the heart and

401
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:46,039
indicators for hijacked it also how do

402
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:47,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if your account is hijacked the</font>

403
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,840
cherry valance very nice you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

404
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,460
notification so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> popper and say</font>

405
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,129
hey there's a new device linked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

406
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">account may be true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to block it</font>

407
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:01,120
or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the K or something like that</font>

408
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,559
for Steven it's bad because you just

409
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,539
jacket you just do it

410
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,789
you're sending message of this veil so

411
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,220
it's not working anymore the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost during</font>

412
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:13,070
the registration process of the attacker

413
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,820
they can read new keys and it isn't

414
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:20,749
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a routine anymore after what</font>

415
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:24,320
that is very nice too if you hide check

416
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:26,419
the account the wig thing can't get any

417
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages and more and you can't really</font>

418
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,249
register immediately because you have to

419
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:35,029
wait some specific time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this in time</font>

420
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:41,029
increases the more you we register so

421
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:42,710
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> toss ok Larry bet on the</font>

422
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact of the account I checked and so</font>

423
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what's up you get a group chats and</font>

424
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,509
account other contact information which

425
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,539
are in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tracks to the phone</font>

426
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:56,619
number and the messengers and for change

427
00:23:53,539 --> 00:24:00,759
telegram you have the possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

428
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:04,039
lock the device but if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi checked</font>

429
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,440
so how they also mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their</font>

430
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">website telegram so the store all the</font>

431
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> photo video documentation and</font>

432
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,710
you can receive almost massive messages

433
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,419
from way back so it will attacker i

434
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,279
texted how'd you get all the messages

435
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:25,159
which are not entering encrypted or

436
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:29,240
group chats so you may feel blocked the

437
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,309
new link to mask as if the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

438
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,230
the new link device attacker already

439
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:39,110
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages and yeah this nice</font>

440
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,470
blog post with Barry Jacobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will talk</font>

441
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:47,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this the maturity knew about him</font>

442
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,679
because a developer for signal messenger

443
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:59,539
so next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing medications yeah I really</font>

444
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,639
mentioned for table you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have pho</font>

445
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:06,769
telegram has the possibility to define

446
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:09,199
casserole so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work which</font>

447
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:11,869
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new account you have trained to</font>

448
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the password and specialists hope strong</font>

449
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,290
so you can

450
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,120
hi check it anymore and follow essential

451
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:24,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten in signal yeah you have no</font>

452
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:27,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">way so it's right back the next one is</font>

453
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:30,178
about privacy so how the message at

454
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,250
messengers upload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> context</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there</font>

455
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:38,910
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hashed or chopping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plain</font>

456
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:42,030
support signal you have these hashes so

457
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,650
the Twitter hash with owner of the phone

458
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:47,040
numbers of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts upload this to</font>

459
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:48,660
reservoir so yeah nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad year but the</font>

460
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very small</font>

461
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,480
range of possible correct characters so

462
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,299
just create rainbow tables and put was

463
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,110
it and yeah you get the phone on a plane

464
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:04,410
but other messengers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't encrypt or</font>

465
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:07,379
hash or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has uploaded in</font>

466
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:11,340
pain so for privacy reasons not the bad

467
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,169
thing and signal try to mitigate this

468
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,840
problem of mine solution for this

469
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:19,040
problem so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some ideas how do</font>

470
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,790
it but there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem how to</font>

471
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:26,850
get the repeal of private information<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

472
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:29,418
there would be a option to send just

473
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:33,330
database with all the registered

474
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:35,750
contacts for example for our signal sent

475
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:39,449
us to the client and the client can

476
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,460
check it on Tyneside but then yeah you

477
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,840
have all the context from which are

478
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,910
registered do students<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

479
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,230
bastard here and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high</font>

480
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,809
network node because you have download

481
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,809
your pic database<font color="#CCCCCC"> its own alternate the</font>

482
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:59,070
bastard year then was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea to use</font>

483
00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:02,700
bloom filters because they have signal

484
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,070
has so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many users it's also not</font>

485
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,820
possible because the database is also

486
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,070
very big and you also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

487
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,409
then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> all contacts because all</font>

488
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">contents are a stone's bloom character</font>

489
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,650
and you charge good for us it and get

490
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,959
all the contacts

491
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,110
love it there would be the next solution

492
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,510
is to bloom filters so this mitigates

493
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">brown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the brute passing isn't</font>

494
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible anymore and to reduce the</font>

495
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,770
problem with the net returning the

496
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:39,669
world's also the solution to use shared

497
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:43,090
bloom filters the last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

498
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is to define the size of the</font>

499
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:50,409
chunks because if the size is too low

500
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:52,620
then you can it's also not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you</font>

501
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font>

502
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:01,510
also and still bloom filter to pick the

503
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,020
Chinese to pick then you have a high

504
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,600
network traffic and I am so also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

505
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:11,889
good solution and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the also mention your</font>

506
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:18,490
blog post is here if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you produce bloom</font>

507
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:21,820
filters have round<font color="#E5E5E5"> down as if each uses</font>

508
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,350
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal boots download the broomfield</font>

509
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:31,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">advanced to have around 40 mg out of 10</font>

510
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,770
times per second so high traffic so I

511
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,719
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bloom filter swear on</font>

512
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:41,050
explain it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on filter what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

513
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,290
is used to test analysis is in a sec so

514
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:47,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">she said so for example has all the</font>

515
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:51,309
contacts and you what want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check if</font>

516
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:55,090
your local<font color="#E5E5E5"> context of active users so</font>

517
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:59,200
you don't filter problem this year false

518
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,620
positives are possible but you're always

519
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,460
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> near it is not possible so if you</font>

520
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:10,209
check it and the method say no this is

521
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:15,490
not a wedded contact and its really like

522
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can mitigate the problem is to</font>

523
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:26,260
false positives by charging some things

524
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned later so dark so we have an</font>

525
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">enter bloom filter in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific size</font>

526
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:36,040
there's an area of ambit swirl and all

527
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:38,260
are set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero we have different</font>

528
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,409
hashing functions the armed guards

529
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:44,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">approves is just to generate a position</font>

530
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:47,500
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area so if you have three hashing</font>

531
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,470
functions you get three positions in the

532
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:55,750
area afterwards for one element you want

533
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:58,450
to add to the bloom filter and with the

534
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,720
hashing function is possible to reduce

535
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,480
the false positives so if you adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

536
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">hash in front</font>

537
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,910
the values of distributed the area so

538
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:14,780
you can litigate the problem is to false

539
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:17,960
positives so<font color="#CCCCCC"> short example hard work sir</font>

540
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,149
have for example this can be three

541
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,169
different phone numbers and you will

542
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:27,440
have free hashing functions and you use

543
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,120
the hashing function to generate the

544
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,980
position so you use the first hashing

545
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,809
function for the first value you get

546
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,970
this position then it's a contraction

547
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,450
function you get this position and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

548
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:40,250
first with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> position and this is how</font>

549
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,200
to generate the bloom filter and then

550
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,290
you sent a bloom filter for example a

551
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,760
signal to the client the guy can verify

552
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,530
it so if another phone number just make

553
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,770
sure you tell you if it is in the bloom

554
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:57,020
filter it generates also of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three</font>

555
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:59,418
values so the three positions in the

556
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arabs with reaction functions their</font>

557
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:07,220
cigars one also one here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 02 this</font>

558
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,309
means it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the room filter and</font>

559
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,610
you that context that is that this

560
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:20,750
number is not I have contact register

561
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:24,110
contact so yeah next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about privacy</font>

562
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think what's fine of you you regard</font>

563
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,330
what spire so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said we have the</font>

564
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,210
problem normal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set the prior</font>

565
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,570
super missions that you get in don't

566
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:40,429
send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last online state to store your</font>

567
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:43,820
rent so it would be nice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

568
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:47,990
is if the users current yummy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you</font>

569
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:50,000
see that in the upper corner and so if

570
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> track the status and check it every</font>

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,820
second you can just create in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thailand</font>

572
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,370
then you see also if uses how long do

573
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,939
use is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and which time and create some</font>

574
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:05,449
statistics out of it and is also by

575
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,830
myself so the example at the distant

576
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,220
friend

577
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,199
vector and yeah some basic through<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

578
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,169
when you wake up when you have lunch

579
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,480
break and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to bed and I think</font>

580
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:19,950
when you do it for a long time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

581
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,039
get many nice information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it and</font>

582
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:26,320
yeah for the veteran first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

583
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:29,350
thought it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible not the same</font>

584
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,629
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that water because messengers</font>

585
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:36,750
for their smartphones don't get the

586
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:41,320
information but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the linux</font>

587
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:44,669
kernel time you get all the information

588
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:50,230
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information if a user is</font>

589
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:53,110
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna open the application</font>

590
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,210
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you open the application then</font>

591
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,809
it sends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests to the server and</font>

592
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:03,190
this request it can also be distributed

593
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:05,879
to the next time so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a blog</font>

594
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:09,399
post to talk about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem yeah</font>

595
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,980
also that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to just</font>

596
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:14,469
writing program who tracks it all the

597
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:18,100
time and create a similar timeline back

598
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:21,309
what's up so the last part is about in

599
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:25,209
the transmission and storage how do you

600
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:29,250
store the data so first up into two

601
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:31,750
storage signal you have the database

602
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,429
especially their messengers in the

603
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,730
database an encrypted with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the master</font>

604
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">key but this master here is stored on</font>

605
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,809
the local advisor it would be possible

606
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,750
to extract his master key and decrypt

607
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:46,178
the database but the mess he can also be

608
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,070
encrypted if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user-defined password so</font>

609
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:50,110
it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this person so the</font>

610
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,158
database is really encrypted and it just

611
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:55,490
not just by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the master key which is or</font>

612
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,790
is thought on your

613
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">how device your four kilograms esta con</font>

614
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,020
you have no database encryption also

615
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,840
that plane only protected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font>

616
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditions especially if you have a room</font>

617
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,350
to devise it's no problem to extract

618
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:15,020
this database and see all the messengers

619
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:17,389
also the opinion that is possibility to

620
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,980
set up in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin is only used if you</font>

621
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,290
open the application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

622
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,659
enter the spin and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can access</font>

623
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,369
them the application but it has no

624
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:30,800
effect on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database encryption so</font>

625
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:33,200
just stall and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane yeah for a message</font>

626
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have also an old into</font>

627
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian for the local theater</font>

628
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:41,629
piece which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used in the messenger so</font>

629
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:46,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">also only protected by the file</font>

630
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:49,250
permissions but the backup is encrypted

631
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,139
because they stored in here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

632
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">start on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the SD card is wrong readable</font>

633
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,850
for every application on your smartphone

634
00:34:52,699 --> 00:35:00,470
can access days to sprout since do that

635
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:03,200
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this but the problem</font>

636
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">is test is that the key and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DM is also</font>

637
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,529
stored and the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage so if you</font>

638
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,720
have a rooted device or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

639
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">supplement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file permissions it's also</font>

640
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,939
possible to decrypt the backup and yeah

641
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:20,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok nice try but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best</font>

642
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:25,580
solution and so valuable in today's

643
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:30,230
encryption also was a veteran last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font>

644
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:32,210
messenger I my message because of the

645
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,750
fact that in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisors I cryptid a</font>

646
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,810
full device encryption of default so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

647
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:43,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some kind of encryption and your</font>

648
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:47,630
yeah didn't check if they encrypt the

649
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:54,680
database also so yeah is this protected

650
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:58,790
by the device encryption itself so last

651
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:00,859
one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmission you fill out</font>

652
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,200
that for the line messenger it's

653
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:05,109
possible to interest

654
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,210
so if you have a middle position you can

655
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:09,848
intercept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the profile pictures by</font>

656
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:17,320
example and replace it with you our

657
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:21,160
funny guy awesome a picture and they

658
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,470
also transmit the stickers which are

659
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,180
suggested in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat so you eat you</font>

660
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:30,879
right up if you write<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolling it you get</font>

661
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,480
some suggested stickers and I realize

662
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,270
that so log can if you have the manual

663
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,030
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be onion to replace all</font>

664
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:42,759
stickers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're using this track and</font>

665
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,089
also the sticker shop it's also replace

666
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,630
