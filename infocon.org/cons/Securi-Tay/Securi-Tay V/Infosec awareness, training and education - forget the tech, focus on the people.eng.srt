underneath that was a 12 month contract

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,130
to go and identify what their weaknesses

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,320
we are an information security and bring

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,800
them up to a level that was commensurate

<font color="#CCCCCC">officers and I think the focus should be</font>

24
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:02,358
much much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

35
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,670
as an information skilled professional I

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,520
was good night attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caused have a</font>

37
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,260
great deal of issue for me because I was

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,000
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak to an organization from</font>

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,980
a position of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mighty when I was trying</font>

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,080
to speak business language so real real

41
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,260
charge so when I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,480
organization last March we set some

43
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,860
goals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the calls were quite simple</font>

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,270
that was a big safeguarding

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,830
organizational information whether

46
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,140
thatís customer information partner

information intellectual property etc

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:04,880
etc really important so I'm just going

50
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,650
to jump back asleep as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

54
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,040
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation so we set some</font>

55
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,240
goals but it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a punk from my</font>

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,380
first week I guess in the organization

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,780
when we started going out Johnny this

58
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:30,140
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I Chi have you tried turning it</font>

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,030
off and on again that is really bad

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,559
impression that organization certainly

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,830
from a security perspective hadn't

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">really done security before new concept</font>

to them in terms of business business

challenge business enabler and it was

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,970
pretty much we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do that switch off</font>

are the key assumptions what I make an

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,270
assumption that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have in place</font>

only to meet compliance and legal

in terms of the invitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and formation</font>

security but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the tools</font>

181
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,390
themselves wouldn't make that and just

182
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,470
send me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sessions because actually I</font>

don't really want to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,770
day-to-day stuff you should be able to

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,290
cook without yourself give me the

186
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,270
exceptions but more importantly than

187
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make them a center of knowledge and</font>

excellence and the friends and families

189
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,120
network so give them the tools that they

can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> boil in their element of</font>

society or in the community be the egg

spear and shield our knowledge so this

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,890
is taken from an estimate so everybody

194
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,590
gets awareness some people get a sex

195
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,300
then we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules for training</font>

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you look especially for</font>

197
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,000
education so not everybody needs

198
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,330
education but i think but you need to be

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest it's about gold than that what we</font>

this is the Deep Web of which the dark

the dark web you need a special browser

344
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,060
such as The Onion Router or tour which

money related transactions are made

using crypto currencies such as Bitcoin

their value can fluctuate significantly

videos into a more academic virtual

635
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:40,130
learning environment so that we can

636
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:43,130
share those appropriately and there's

637
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,200
also move a food across the Scottish

let's share that good experience this is

boring and going out with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,320
I've got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's</font>

659
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,939
somebody saw something so volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

660
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,939
produced and wanted to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that across</font>

661
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,919
the friends and family another thing i

662
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,429
didn't like totally anybody have a Pecha

663

<font color="#E5E5E5">developed in Japan and Andhra few years</font>

667
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago and it's a very key presentations</font>

668
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,889
concise he says 25 minutes of these

669
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,799
presentation so the premise here is that

670
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,270
you produce an image and you speak to

671
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,860
that image and that image automatically

672
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,870
forwards to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next image after 20</font>

673
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,539
seconds so you like 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> images and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

674
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,270
like 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds of image from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:18,149
presentation perspective really focuses

you to get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> message across and a</font>

677
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:24,928
concise fashion so I've recorded one

678
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:27,360
here is what I give a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I've</font>

679
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:29,909
recorded that and I'll play down on

680
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,129
seeso six minutes 40 seconds long I'll

681
