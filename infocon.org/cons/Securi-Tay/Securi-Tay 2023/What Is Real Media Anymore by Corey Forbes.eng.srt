1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,180
yeah so hi everyone

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,519
um as the title suggests

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,460
um the question that's on my mind as

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,040
well even as real media in the present

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,420
day

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,220
um and to get into that I'm going to

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,920
cover in Broad Strokes

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
um where we sort of started with media

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,080
how we got to what we have today

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,920
um what

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
what is wrong with it from obviously the

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
security side of it I mean we're all

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,940
security people here

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,920
um

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
what are the sort of

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,760
policies and procedures in place that

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,559
keeps this information and

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,940
misinformation at bait and then what we

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,280
need to do to solve all these problems

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
that we're seeing in the present day

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
um

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,379
so I'm an Alum here ever take

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,360
um so I thought might as well give a

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,340
talk at security because I didn't manage

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,140
to do it in my 10 year

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,539
um I used to be a consumer security

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,700
consultant so for a few years I was

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,340
doing the the app and network pen testy

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,600
stuff

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,700
um and then I moved into becoming a

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,700
developer just creating things

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,939
is no better feeling to be honest so

33
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,820
I'm currently working on a provenance

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,460
focused social media it's called frankly

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,619
and I will be talking about it later but

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,420
right at the end because I'm not trying

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,520
to make a sales pitch

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
um so we'll start off then with like the

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,799
background of media

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,659
um

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,740
so a little disclaimer as well that a

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,000
lot of what I'm going to be talking

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,240
about and focused on is images

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,700
I'm not trying to belittle the world of

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,619
those with vision issues

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,360
um but it's just that there's so much

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
content

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,680
um in this world and are in this space

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
rather in images are the easiest way to

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,079
get the sort of ideas across

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,640
um

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,500
so

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
the

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,758
the way that we would capture a lot of

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,540
ideas and events in the past was very uh

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
was based on these two mediums like

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,280
painting and drawing what we saw and

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,599
writing

59
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,120
um the tales of what happened

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
um very opinion based written commentary

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,780
and

62
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,599
then when it comes to Art and the actual

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,660
drawing process it takes a lot of time

64
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,780
to like capture that into a medium and

65
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,680
you're not exactly in a position where

66
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,480
you can simply draw up something that

67
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,819
you've even never seen as well yourself

68
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,459
so you need to have also been present

69
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,739
and there's elements of word of mouth

70
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,319
and so on that really plays into all

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,400
this

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,780
um

73
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,540
so yeah they're not exactly the perfect

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,640
mediums for capturing things exactly how

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
they occurred

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
um

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,500
and this led to some interesting results

78
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,780
and this is the first part of audience

79
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,120
participation if it decides to go for it

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
okay it's already given you the answer

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
but let's pretend that we didn't see

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
that and guess what all these different

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
animals are

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,720
um if anyone actually wants to give a

85
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,879
guess or we're just gonna skip

86
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,860
feel free

87
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,959
because I mean that one's an absolute

88
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,300
State on the top left there

89
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,980
um

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,579
yeah

91
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,739
and then

92
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,620
yeah so obviously different stages of

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,300
its life cycle is what you're trying to

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,360
say in those captions here yeah

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,500
um a lot of this misinformation around I

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,420
mean spoiler obviously came up

97
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,000
hippopotamuses

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,519
um a lot of it came around the the

99
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,599
actual name of a hippo it translated to

100
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,959
like War Horse so obviously you know you

101
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,420
you look you hear War Horse and you draw

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,760
like the

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,700
the swan thing or some fish with extra

104
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,140
legs like

105
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,720
you needed to sort of

106
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,540
again this clickers shape yeah

107
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,000
you needed to be there see it

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,380
um you needed to

109
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,019
you know be present and obviously that's

110
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,298
not possible like these things live in

111
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,460
very specific climates and here in

112
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,500
Scotland that's quite pilgrimage just to

113
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,880
see a hippo

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,720
um

115
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,259
so the gossip the rumors that the spoken

116
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,780
word around these things would conjure

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,500
images that obviously didn't

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,979
reflects what was real and again these

119
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,500
mediums are slow people aren't going to

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,300
stop in the middle of pillaging a

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,639
village so that the picture can be or

122
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,220
the painting can be drawn

123
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,620
um and

124
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,199
the written word about what happened

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,680
if everyone in said Village was taken

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
out who's actually going to write about

127
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,520
it from the point of view of the

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,500
defender so

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,800
thankfully when Tech Advanced it took

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,020
away a lot of the limitations

131
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,639
um in terms of capturing what was real

132
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,680
and what happened

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,759
um

134
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,639
sound waves uh light photons they

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,979
weren't just a transient thing they just

136
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,500
flew by never to really occur again in

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,360
the same fashion and it was something

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,020
that was captured then into medium

139
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,320
in terms of chemical film uh obviously

140
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
it was quite a

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,180
specific set of events needed to happen

142
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,460
in order to capture it

143
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,560
um appropriately so

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,220
there is an element of trust and the the

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,199
science behind it

146
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,880
um

147
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,199
and yeah of course the point that I I'm

148
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,600
trying to place here with the um the

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,780
dates is that What mattered most is when

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,120
the majority of people started to have

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,600
the opportunity to access this Tech

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,940
commercial cameras and Commercial record

153
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,180
players uh gramophones Etc capturing it

154
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
in the house

155
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,620
um and then the combination of these two

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,120
to

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,320
result in video as well

158
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,979
so

159
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,319
in terms of audio music took on a whole

160
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,960
new depth of appreciation and we're able

161
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,180
to play it in the homes

162
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,380
um science uh didn't uh used to be in

163
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,039
fact like a audience style thing where

164
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,960
some guy would be up down here at the

165
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,940
front performing a science experiment

166
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,520
and it was down to all the people who

167
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,520
witnessed it to spread the news of what

168
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
the the experiment yielded

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
um

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,759
and then journalism as well in the form

171
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,800
of the newspaper

172
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,759
um

173
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,680
it took a long time for photos to

174
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
actually be incorporated in there but of

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,199
course seeing those things

176
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,960
provides a bit more assurance that it

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,580
happened there's an element of feeling

178
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,800
present

179
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,419
um and you wouldn't think anyone would

180
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,260
abuse it

181
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,800
[Music]

182
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,940
um

183
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,880
but of course that happens this is one

184
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,120
of the more lighthearted first examples

185
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,940
of abuse with photography

186
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,720
um

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,440
these are uh two of the five photos

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
referred to as the cartingly fairies

189
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,259
which are quite a fun example of what

190
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,720
amateur photographers in 1917 were able

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,340
to come up with

192
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,560
um trying to replicate Slice of Life

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,500
Life imagery where they were interacting

194
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,539
with fairies and gnomes

195
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,099
and um

196
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,699
none other than the scientific main

197
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,979
behind Sherlock Holmes Arthur Conan

198
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,680
Doyle who was a massive spiritualist

199
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,020
I saw these photos and was like

200
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,819
I saw the proof I need

201
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm gonna spread the good word

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
and at the time I believe he was working

203
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,020
a newspaper company so it was like I

204
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,460
want to get it printed I want to tell

205
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,680
the world I want everyone to know and

206
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,780
they were like they're obviously fake

207
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,960
and he's like I'll prove it it went to

208
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,780
three different validators for this

209
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,280
imagery

210
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,560
um one of them being Kodak

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,340
um two of those companies then agreed

212
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,160
the photos aren't tampered with like

213
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,700
these are real photos because yeah the

214
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,860
photos weren't edited and post it was a

215
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,020
staged event

216
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,539
um the guys at Kodak specifically said

217
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,440
like

218
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,599
this obviously isn't real but like the

219
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,339
photo itself wasn't doctored he's like

220
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,399
good enough for me getting it printed

221
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,360
yeah

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,240
so that's like an idea of what an

223
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,000
individual was capable of uh even quite

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
early on in the commercial photography

225
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
times

226
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,260
um and then you go into nation states as

227
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,899
well and the both of these of course

228
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,220
being

229
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,959
thought was of the same man different

230
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,839
times of his life Joseph Stalin

231
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,800
um

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,660
a lot of people see this one on the left

233
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,779
of him when he was quite a young man

234
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,399
um and it's quite funny because I

235
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,320
recently realized that this even was

236
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,779
slightly doctored

237
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,880
this was after he'd already died some

238
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Museum was setting up an exhibit of like

239
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,740
look at all our sexy leaders I guess and

240
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,440
they put the Vaseline filter on them and

241
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,060
when he was younger he had like acne

242
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,459
scarring obviously it's quite a minor

243
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
minor thing but like they edited the

244
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,560
photo to make them look a lot more

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,180
younger and

246
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
have more attractive leader I guess it's

247
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,140
a bit weird

248
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,980
um

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,040
but then separately as well

250
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
um those of you might be familiar with

251
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,120
the new Google product Magic Eraser and

252
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
Stalin was really good at that and

253
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,019
cutting out a young lad there called

254
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,580
Nikolai

255
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,220
um who was just kicked out of the

256
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,080
Communist Party

257
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,899
um and obviously wanted to change what

258
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,459
actually happened and say well I was

259
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,620
never associated with this man

260
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,399
um

261
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,660
yeah

262
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,640
so

263
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,279
like I said earlier as well it used to

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,000
be that the the systems to capture this

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,860
imagery was quite a straightforward

266
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,200
process it was the laws of physics and

267
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,680
chemistry and uh the light was in itself

268
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,160
painting the scene onto the film

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,580
and there was no middlemen no gadgetry

270
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,459
um no SD cards you know there's no

271
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,680
interpretation for how it happened

272
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,200
there's no way to manipulate that

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,380
particularly easy easily especially when

274
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,240
you've got this Source you can always

275
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
point to the film and say well this is

276
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,200
the original like this is how it happens

277
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,019
but nowadays we have a lot more CCD

278
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,339
sensors there's still some die hards

279
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,560
um film photography sort of people out

280
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,360
there but

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,860
um when these

282
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,480
started to become particularly

283
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,019
affordable in the mid 80s

284
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:13,800
um

285
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,320
the photography Community are the people

286
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,779
who are really uh passionate about

287
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,820
film-based photography we're sort of

288
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,860
sounding the alarm like this is it truth

289
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,920
is truth is going away but we largely

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,260
ignored them because like you know

291
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,360
what's the worst that can happen

292
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,980
um

293
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,700
and then we spread run even further

294
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,380
um all those scientific advancements we

295
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,420
know just carry them about in our

296
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,920
pockets

297
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,300
um

298
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,079
we're able to consume all the cat dog

299
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,779
media uh that we like

300
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,360
um so yeah no one uses it for anything

301
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,480
that important so we're all fine I guess

302
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,380
well

303
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,240
yeah of course

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,420
it isn't all cat and dog foods

305
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,120
um there's a whole rabbit hole again

306
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,160
going on with Animal Club

307
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
um that we can go down

308
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,940
um of all the different facets of

309
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,779
society that really rely on media in

310
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,540
order to convey a sense of trust

311
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,200
um

312
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,420
I don't want a cherry pick

313
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,760
all right I don't wanna

314
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,640
try and cover the whole Spectrum there

315
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,680
um so I will cherry pick rather citizen

316
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,360
journalism

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,180
um as a good example of what we need to

318
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,260
be

319
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,720
focusing some of the effort on at the

320
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,839
moment

321
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,279
we used to consume our news through an

322
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,260
AM PM paper

323
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,980
um again like media started to build

324
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,899
itself into there to make you feel

325
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,959
present with the media make you feel

326
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,600
like a witness to the events um that

327
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
occurred in the present as well

328
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,959
um but with the modern world and these

329
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,000
modern devices comes a modern

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,579
consumption habit

331
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,638
um

332
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,779
some people

333
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,019
myself included rely on Independent

334
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,660
reviewers on YouTube to say is this

335
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,019
technology actually going to be you know

336
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,180
the one that I want uh to bring

337
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,760
something into the house or even

338
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,339
quite a few steps further their Facebook

339
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,440
groups that circulate their politically

340
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,139
charged content amongst themselves

341
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,060
slightly Echo team very fashion but

342
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,339
regardless a lot of that in order to

343
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,399
convey points is through media

344
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,540
um

345
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,880
and when you combine Facebook and

346
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,220
Instagram under the metasphere that's

347
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,500
like

348
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,940
1.65 billion images being uploaded daily

349
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,779
um according to one source and then

350
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,420
um on YouTube there was another source

351
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,120
that said in June of 2022

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,120
um for every minute it was 500 hours of

353
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,279
content being uploaded

354
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,480
um

355
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,620
and then there's uh crazy Elon buying

356
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,240
Twitter and you know making truth and

357
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,459
like authenticity eight dollars a month

358
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,920
so

359
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,180
um

360
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,399
from the citizen journalism space and

361
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,459
especially when a lot of these pieces of

362
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,680
media get circulated up to the bigger

363
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,200
organizations

364
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,019
um we're relying on fact checking

365
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,000
mechanisms

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,160
um to validate each individual piece of

367
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,959
media before it gets published in a more

368
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,639
official manner

369
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
um and relying on forensics

370
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,079
investigations uh methods just to ensure

371
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,180
that there hasn't been any tampering

372
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,180
with a lot of these pieces of media

373
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,620
um

374
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,300
and then of course the grease the wheel

375
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,279
there's obviously elements of automation

376
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,899
for both

377
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,240
um to ensure that there's no mess or

378
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,760
disinformation being brought into the

379
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,800
modern news cycle

380
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,540
um those things do happen of course

381
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,560
there's examples that I'll go into later

382
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
um that

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,860
I mean a good one I actually don't have

384
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,740
in the slides later that I'll go into is

385
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,519
um game footage from ARMA 2

386
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,920
um a military simulator getting put on

387
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,500
the BBC News is a headline story because

388
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,880
they thought it was captured in the

389
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,740
field like

390
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,839
so

391
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,459
yeah I mentioned messing this

392
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,240
information and if there's subtle

393
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,800
differences between these two that I

394
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,139
just wanted to quickly address

395
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,959
um mess information

396
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:51,779
is the less serious one

397
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,660
um it's more or there's less harm and

398
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,540
misinformation life's importance and

399
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,899
typically the information being

400
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,620
misconstrued

401
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,959
um it's more like rumors insults and

402
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,279
pranks

403
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,920
um but then you go into this information

404
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,760
and that's

405
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,579
media content that's out there to

406
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,399
deliberately deceive people into a false

407
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,360
narrative

408
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,760
propaganda

409
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,199
um fishing

410
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
and just general hoaxes

411
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,079
um would fall more under that category

412
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,100
um

413
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,860
like I said that's the two main axis is

414
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,220
that Define the to or where it fits

415
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,839
between the two different terms of

416
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,579
course I'll use it synonymously but

417
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,040
things like

418
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,980
Fades are evidence of fairies that lives

419
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,100
in the middle like is it that important

420
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,720
that it's this information

421
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,699
um I don't know that's why it falls

422
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,459
within the

423
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,839
start space but I'll use them

424
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,519
interchangeably

425
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
um

426
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,360
and it's all personal opinion as well I

427
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,740
mean I personally would think that

428
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,920
cosmetic brands touching up The Afters

429
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,899
on a before and after for their new

430
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,520
products that falls into mess

431
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,740
information

432
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,199
see with it

433
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,299
Kylie Jenner and stuff are doing or

434
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,859
they're like photoshopping their thumb

435
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,859
out of like these Instagram photos that

436
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,540
they're putting up as part of their ad

437
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,959
campaigns yeah but the importance there

438
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,240
isn't too high as the consumer you can

439
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,480
obviously just not buy that product but

440
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,900
then things like War propaganda and

441
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,660
showing upholstered interpretation of

442
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,120
troops or equipment

443
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,700
um that's life's at stake the importance

444
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,200
shoots up

445
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,260
um even if it's only one extra tank for

446
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,640
example

447
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,860
um that's that's quite firmly in

448
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,399
disinformation

449
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,559
oh I don't know how that go in there

450
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,260
but yeah so

451
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,160
the big issues then that really we see

452
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,960
um

453
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,260
from a societal perspective like the

454
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,840
idea of these filters coming in

455
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,059
um is obviously body image issues you

456
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,520
see a lot of that but generally like

457
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
just having those little subtle edits is

458
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
the default mode and it makes it hard to

459
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,020
obviously guess like what's actually

460
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,059
real and what's not

461
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,200
um

462
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,179
I have a few images or videos that I

463
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,100
might show at the end and that really

464
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,960
put the point across here but I'm scared

465
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,940
keynote will crash on me or something

466
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,600
um

467
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,160
so

468
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,520
yeah and because of the accessibility of

469
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,220
these things it's trivial why wouldn't

470
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,679
you do it is almost becoming the

471
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,860
narrative which is uh a little bit

472
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,020
disappointing

473
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,700
um

474
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,220
and then we don't even need to have like

475
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,200
someone stood in front of the camera and

476
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,240
the photo being taken to manipulate it

477
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,820
we can simply stage the event like I

478
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,460
mentioned with ARMA 2 and what BBC News

479
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,640
decided was headline content

480
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,780
um

481
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,240
there's

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,480
cases where you can just simply you know

483
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,840
spawn a tank in one of those things and

484
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,140
take a video of that or you know

485
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,299
taking photos of people that don't

486
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,880
generally or they don't actually exist

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
and again the main stress and the

488
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,919
importance here is that this has become

489
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,480
so trivial

490
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,679
um

491
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,320
there's yeah there's no need for the

492
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,480
real camera to be there you feed your

493
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,880
photo into

494
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,860
a system enough times and it can maybe

495
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,960
even generate photos of you on the beach

496
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,059
for example

497
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:42,900
um

498
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,460
especially through systems like

499
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,559
generative AI which are really taking

500
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,100
the scene things like chat GPT and all

501
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,400
of the different image based models

502
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
um

503
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,539
it's one of the greatest disinformation

504
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,539
machines that I've kicked out recently

505
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,640
um it's not all the silly that deep

506
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
faked audios of trump and Biden on the

507
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,799
headsets that I'm sure everyone else has

508
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,780
been seeing on Twitter recently which

509
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,480
honestly cracked me up but

510
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,559
um there is the greater impact

511
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,340
um things like at its worst revenge porn

512
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,679
people's faces being put onto the

513
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,740
actresses and particular scenes or even

514
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,679
again coming back to fishing

515
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,660
um using someone's

516
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,240
real face gives an opportunity for you

517
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,700
to reverse and find whether or not that

518
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,760
person actually sent you a message

519
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,380
um

520
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,260
and then the consequences for a lot of

521
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,340
this stuff hasn't been

522
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,660
um nation state levels yet

523
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,900
but for example

524
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,820
um one maliciously generated political

525
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,760
speech May

526
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,240
like the Pakistan and India situation

527
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,760
into further disarray

528
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
um America and China

529
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,419
uh Russia NATO so there is obviously

530
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,240
some real impacts that can be seen that

531
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,679
could potentially be Targets in the

532
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
future but

533
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,600
uh I'll bring it back a bit we'll have a

534
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,679
little fun game of audience

535
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,179
participation that will hopefully work

536
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,620
this time

537
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,820
um

538
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,020
I'm gonna show four photos

539
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,760
these first two

540
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,740
um here that I'll just keep on screen

541
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,140
whilst I explain

542
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,820
um basically

543
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,880
I've generated some AI faces and it's a

544
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,580
matter of what do you believe are the

545
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,220
real humans and which do you believe are

546
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,679
the AI faces here

547
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,320
um here's the last two

548
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,659
I'll give you another moment here

549
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm obviously using the contrast of this

550
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,140
monitor or projector to my advantage

551
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,539
um but

552
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:01,740
yeah

553
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,080
if anyone wants to have a guess at who

554
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
is real who is not

555
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,720
um feel free yep

556
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,039
you think image one is fake do you have

557
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,820
any idea why

558
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,580
this is

559
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,240
okay

560
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,760
yeah the the light Reflections yeah

561
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,419
um

562
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,299
no that's fair I mean that's obviously a

563
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,280
major part of it and the sense of

564
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,600
uncanny valley that you might be

565
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,158
experiencing through that uh yeah

566
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,260
oh the shoulder on the right hand side

567
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,240
or just the lack of shoulder in the left

568
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,159
yeah

569
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,240
um

570
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
any other guesses

571
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,360
uh sure sure

572
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,320
yeah

573
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,419
I'll take the last two that I saw here

574
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,020
starting with you

575
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,400
yep that's a good show you're getting to

576
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,960
what I'm about to go into in a minute

577
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,220
and last one up there

578
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,179
yeah I mean all the features are

579
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,520
Telltale sounds but yeah the ears are

580
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,500
certainly one that especially in most

581
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,480
headshots that these things will be

582
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,080
taking in like it may not have like a

583
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
lot of side profiles to train on the

584
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,740
ears too well

585
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,640
um

586
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,260
and these photos all look a lot more

587
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,700
human than some of the ones from liquid

588
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,220
but I'll assure you that none of these

589
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,020
are actually real

590
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,740
um

591
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
someone and besage Basingstoke actually

592
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,820
caught on that quite quickly I was

593
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,059
impressed but yeah none of these

594
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,460
um are real here

595
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,380
um I'm trusting the clicker again for a

596
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,220
while but uh we made this thing

597
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,440
um in order to spot the Deep fakes

598
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,559
um

599
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,179
I'm just borrowing it because I was a

600
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,820
bit lazy to write my own so this is

601
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,760
quite focused on video but things like

602
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,280
asymmetric jewelry can be a really big

603
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,559
giveaway because that's not typically

604
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,140
the focus of someone who's declaring a

605
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,900
success case to these algorithms

606
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,340
um so especially when it comes to

607
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,980
glasses noticing little bumps

608
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,840
um can really help

609
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,940
um obviously yes you mentioned earlier I

610
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,400
think in the middle about the teeth

611
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
um sometimes it doesn't understand how

612
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
many incisors a person should have for

613
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,620
example so noticing three or one or one

614
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,640
and a half

615
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,159
um is quite useful

616
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
um I'll go into a few extra examples

617
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
here as well so

618
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,580
this is what I was saying about the

619
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,400
asymmetric jewelry where on the I'll

620
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,480
just do this instead on the left ear is

621
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,200
some weird like drippy metal jewelry

622
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,460
thing and then on the right there's

623
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,320
nothing and it's like

624
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,260
yeah okay the asymmetric jewelry

625
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,659
obviously does exist but this does not

626
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,600
look intentional in any form

627
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,320
um

628
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,279
and again I'm I use the projector to my

629
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,980
advantage but the hairs on the one on

630
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,740
the right start to get a bit wispy and

631
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,840
like the transparency just completely

632
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,279
glues to shot

633
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,080
um if you're looking at it on the screen

634
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
that I've got down here you can see a

635
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,580
little bit of like rainbow colors just

636
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,260
like clipping through as a result

637
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,240
the final one in terms of like uh

638
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,460
glasses here and it just straight up

639
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,500
clips into the cheekbone

640
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,600
um and then there's whatever the

641
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,659
that demon thing is in her shoulder

642
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,960
um like especially again when you're

643
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,360
looking at it on my screen down here and

644
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,919
it looks like they've rendered like

645
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,500
forearm style skin so you have like

646
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,500
really hairy like shoulder thing going

647
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,580
on

648
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,240
um

649
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,700
and it's pretty cracks and that thing's

650
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,539
in my dreams uh so yeah

651
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,940
and this is the the halfway point recap

652
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,500
for anyone who's nursing the security

653
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,179
hangover

654
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,600
um so I talked about the hippo drawings

655
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,480
all quite quickly as a result of my

656
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,980
slides coming up

657
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,720
um so describe why we needed the cameras

658
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,179
obviously in the first place they solved

659
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,440
the misinformation of just Word of Mouth

660
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,279
um

661
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,520
I then went into the cases of some of

662
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,140
the early edits to show that this isn't

663
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,500
a new problem it's just getting easier

664
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,159
um

665
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,159
and the cats out of the bag in terms of

666
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,220
these tools already we can't exactly run

667
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,159
backwards and yeah the potential

668
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
societal harm is obviously real uh

669
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
equally to individuals and again I

670
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
quickly brushed on it but like

671
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,799
self-image is obviously one that's

672
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,799
getting quite uh hit quite hard

673
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,299
um with these sort of tools and these

674
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:19,980
sort of filters

675
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,480
um

676
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,900
so what can we do to fix these problems

677
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,799
um

678
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,500
if you think about it from the

679
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,659
perspective of like every edit it's a

680
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,580
bad edit it just makes this a bit more

681
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,520
of a binary question for now

682
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
um so we could train the user to just

683
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,179
find all bad or all edits all the time

684
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,419
um this is an example here of uh North

685
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,400
Korea in 2013 sending out some

686
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,500
propaganda about how they ordered in

687
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,600
some new hovercraft

688
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,880
um obviously they didn't all arrive so

689
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,500
they ended up having to fake a little

690
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,880
bit of it

691
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,260
um

692
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,580
so these two hovercraft here are very or

693
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,140
the angle of attack they're coming into

694
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,419
on the beach is the exact same the

695
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,240
lighting is the exact same and where the

696
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,740
people are even standing on it or the

697
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,100
exact same Beyond you considering the

698
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,659
fact that they are perhaps the same

699
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,159
hovercraft it's just a bit too

700
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,320
coincidental you run it through some

701
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,880
forensic Stills as well and it just

702
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,159
straight up shows it's a copy paste job

703
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,140
and the same with those two boats at the

704
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,340
back

705
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,520
um and the boxes there represent zooming

706
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
these things to the exact same size and

707
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,980
it really just Paints the picture and

708
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,320
that yeah that's it's just a really bad

709
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,120
copy paste job

710
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,980
um obviously they've had 10 years to

711
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,340
improve on it uh this is 2013.

712
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,240
um

713
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,059
but yeah we could teach the user with

714
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,640
examples like this how to detect these

715
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,880
things right we could uh teach them the

716
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,500
same way that I did earlier with the AI

717
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,539
tools so what does everyone think is

718
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,919
that going to work

719
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,779
uh

720
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,360
rhetorical question no I don't think so

721
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,179
I mean fishing emails

722
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,520
um that's that's a solved problem right

723
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,880
uh you know no one's clicking on them

724
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,020
anymore

725
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,220
um

726
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,000
yeah the the skillshit or skill set

727
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,240
shouldn't be a prerequisite and we

728
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,679
shouldn't have to do a Pearson view exam

729
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,299
to make a Facebook account for example

730
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,799
right

731
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,080
um and the tools I mentioned obviously

732
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,440
that was 2013. and they're just the

733
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,940
tools and the methods are only going to

734
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,279
get more sophisticated

735
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,559
um so training is going to fall behind

736
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,600
uh no shot so you know let's maybe leave

737
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,700
it to the professionals the people that

738
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,440
have gone through this training and who

739
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,140
do it as a job right they both jump on

740
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,419
the keyboard and smash through all the

741
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,580
content that's coming in

742
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,240
um

743
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,880
again just assuming all edits are bad

744
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,340
edits just for the sake of getting that

745
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,740
sort of warning almost that this may

746
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,419
contain an edit or this does contain

747
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,640
that just to make the user a bit more

748
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,880
informed that might be the way to do it

749
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,740
uh not really

750
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,539
um

751
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,000
we can't expect people to pull the

752
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,799
all-nighters to get through the what was

753
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,140
it 500 hours of content per minute on

754
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,399
YouTube

755
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,100
um and we certainly

756
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,020
aren't going to see someone volunteer

757
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,260
pay for it YouTube is already making

758
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,299
profit and they claim and that sort of

759
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,059
they're just making profit and they're

760
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,279
not gonna then sacrifice a whole bunch

761
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,480
of their own profits to make

762
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,159
misinformation and disinformation and

763
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,320
solve the problem

764
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,240
um and the users as well they're gonna

765
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,179
hit the delays that are incurred through

766
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,580
this review process it's just not gonna

767
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,240
really work and there's not always

768
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,460
videos being uploaded publicly there's

769
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,220
the unlisted for example on YouTube and

770
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,960
there's the groups the private groups

771
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,700
and Facebook

772
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,279
um and even in Twitter spaces

773
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,860
um people aren't going to just be happy

774
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,559
that one extra human from outside is

775
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,020
looking into it

776
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,880
um

777
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,440
so

778
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,779
we maybe roll back how we're training

779
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,220
people

780
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,419
uh we incur a bit more of a journalistic

781
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,820
perspective on it just focusing on the

782
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,640
content that's trying to be portrayed

783
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,500
and did that happen is that really or is

784
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,720
that an unedited photo not looking too

785
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,700
far into it just like a do you see a

786
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,820
flying Peg or anything crazy like that

787
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,179
um understanding who was the uh author

788
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,100
of the piece of media who was captured

789
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,440
in it uh getting some context clues of

790
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,340
when where and why they were there

791
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,220
um you can then start to narrow down

792
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,919
contextually as well like was this real

793
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,620
based on you know if they said they were

794
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,399
in

795
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,360
like Dundee at this time of year well

796
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,240
the sun wouldn't have been out

797
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,179
um so why is that a sunny image or it

798
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,039
was raining that day there's historic

799
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,260
records to prove that

800
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,240
um or that's straight up for Eiffel

801
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,980
Tower in the background that's that's

802
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,659
not quite right

803
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:22,260
um

804
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,020
again you know

805
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,960
not all cases are equal as well when it

806
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,940
comes to this sort of stuff so you would

807
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,340
end up sacrificing

808
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,940
some of the Lesser scene content you're

809
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,039
just relying on people to talk about the

810
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,080
most important stuff

811
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,340
um

812
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,980
that sometimes works like

813
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,340
Twitter birdwatch

814
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,960
[Music]

815
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,399
um

816
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,340
not too bad it's sort of confirming that

817
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,980
the content and claims being made

818
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,779
um on your behalf

819
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:55,740
um

820
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,500
but it relies on like a stack Overflow

821
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,260
style contribution manner uh compared to

822
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,820
stack Overflow because I'm a developer

823
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,500
it's just the easiest way to compare it

824
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,059
for myself

825
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,380
um

826
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,799
yeah it does an okay job but again as

827
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,559
mentioned it relies on

828
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,919
um focusing on a subset of the overall

829
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,279
content and

830
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,039
then as well you need to consider who

831
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,899
are these Anonymous people who are

832
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,360
contributing the answers and why are we

833
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,519
meant to trust them uh you go back to

834
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,360
even

835
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,140
uh stack Overflow and chat gpt's

836
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,580
emergence

837
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,440
um and they got inundated with answers

838
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,840
so stack Overflow questions that were

839
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,299
generated from chat GPT

840
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,019
um so

841
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,340
um the

842
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,140
bit of a big block of text I'll tell

843
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,340
they are

844
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,519
um they basically put in a policy to say

845
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,220
don't do it even if the answer is right

846
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,919
because it's just too much

847
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,620
and we we need to just sort of

848
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,799
chill out with it so

849
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,460
what if we get something else in you

850
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,320
know an AI is generating all this

851
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,560
content so let's get an AI to capture it

852
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,560
and then declare whether or not it's

853
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,020
real right

854
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,300
um so

855
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,060
it's an okay idea at the start but then

856
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,399
when that Tool's out there someone else

857
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,460
who's making even if the tool comes out

858
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,399
and it's perfectly able to capture every

859
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,918
single bad piece of content

860
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,219
some point new content will be made that

861
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,339
then can bypass it and the bad guys then

862
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,560
have leveraged to Now train their

863
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,739
generator to be better and we get stuck

864
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,719
in this order Boris

865
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,239
which reminds me as well of antivirus

866
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,119
you know problem solved in the 90s when

867
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,399
we came out with the first one right

868
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,599
um

869
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,960
you go beyond even the check some

870
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,460
methodology that original antiviruses

871
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,040
would have been based on and you talk

872
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,000
about modern day heuristics and

873
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,500
pattern-based checks

874
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,960
um it's still obviously a little bit of

875
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,700
a losing battle when everyone's able to

876
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,520
generate the stuff themselves

877
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,900
um

878
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,760
so

879
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,060
this is the final quarter of the sites

880
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,140
um

881
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,800
maybe we should go from a reactive

882
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,420
analysis from all these all this content

883
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,560
that's been generated to a proactive

884
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,920
validation that what you're generating

885
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,520
um Is Real at the time it was captured

886
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,260
um

887
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,500
this is similar to an existing system

888
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,720
called provenance

889
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,700
um

890
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,980
there's the three examples here of

891
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,400
paintings diamonds and airplane Parts

892
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,880
where as soon as possible a record of

893
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,300
its in its creation and its life cycle

894
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,040
is established

895
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,420
um

896
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,060
as soon as diamonds are maimed they're

897
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,839
sent up um an illegal uh and our legal

898
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,720
main it's sent up to be laser engraved

899
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,680
in order to establish a

900
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,760
removal from the ground and it's

901
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,740
entering into the market

902
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,960
and and that's to

903
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,780
remove the possibility of malicious

904
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,820
diamonds making it in from who are refer

905
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,520
to his blood means

906
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,440
um or blood diamonds sorry they're

907
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,060
referred to us

908
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,240
um additionally in terms of paintings

909
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,660
I'm not always as on the exact moment of

910
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,680
creation uh Records being generated but

911
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,280
maybe a few months or years after and

912
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,579
someone comes in and validates that the

913
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,500
materials that were in use and the

914
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,660
methods that were in use

915
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,599
um and carbon dating all of that like

916
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,880
the time that they expect it to be have

917
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,680
created

918
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,859
um states that there should be made by

919
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,920
the person who they say it was made from

920
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,680
um and again similar to diamonds at the

921
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,780
moment of creation airplane Parts they

922
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,640
get the ID on them as well so

923
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,320
if you compare this into digital media

924
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,560
there's a seamless duplication

925
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,079
from every single file as you copy and

926
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,140
paste it across your hard disk but

927
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,240
and there's a lot of

928
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,400
media that is being generated all the

929
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,140
time and the obviously I mentioned

930
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,780
earlier but computers are really good at

931
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,180
the boarding stuff and just doing this

932
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,380
really rope fashion of like

933
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,880
following along with that massive volume

934
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,760
of content in the first place so

935
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,820
could we take some of the qualities from

936
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,720
a system of provenance like this and

937
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,700
replicate that into a digital system

938
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,240
so

939
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,640
that's a bit of what I've been working

940
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,079
on recently

941
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,980
um and the ideas that I think should

942
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,880
take place going forward to help

943
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,820
curb this information

944
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,140
um

945
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,240
there's already some Solutions on the

946
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,540
Shelf as well that can contribute to

947
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,839
a ledger of all of these actions being

948
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,420
or all of these images taking being

949
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,880
taken and where they came from

950
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:35,820
um

951
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,800
systems I'm referring to are called

952
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,020
distributed ledgers

953
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,520
um

954
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
and I'll elaborate on what that is for

955
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
those of you that don't know

956
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,820
in a timely fashion of course

957
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,540
um

958
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,720
so ledgers are like a database where you

959
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,460
record every single transaction that

960
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,599
happens

961
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,920
um so every single time something is

962
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,440
added or removed and it's just something

963
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,160
that's added to the overall structure

964
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
um and it's not

965
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,960
a point in time capture like databases

966
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,579
are so distributed letters then takes

967
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,300
this technology or takes these captures

968
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,599
and spreads them across multiple systems

969
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,960
um the network between each other using

970
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,020
a system called consensus

971
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,820
um so that they speak to one another in

972
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,680
order to confirm the state that they're

973
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,079
at what has been added who added it and

974
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,920
is it okay to come into the Ledger

975
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,880
um

976
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,200
so

977
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,240
they reach this state of consensus

978
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,760
between themselves that's cool

979
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,619
um

980
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,480
yeah blockchain's evolved from that

981
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,859
system and proof of Base trust or yeah

982
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,020
they brought in an element of an element

983
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,359
of proof-based trust

984
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,460
um to address some concerns they had

985
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,839
with too many people trying to be

986
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,720
involved in individual transactions

987
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,099
um

988
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,859
I'm not trying to buy into all the

989
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:08,040
racist nft hype I'm just talking about

990
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,740
it as if it's a tool so don't worry

991
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,359
um and yeah there's obviously points to

992
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,520
be made in regards to power consumption

993
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,859
of running a system like this

994
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,740
but the spoiler alert is there's not an

995
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,599
excuse anymore to buy all those fantasy

996
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,400
Nvidia graphics cards and calling it

997
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,780
work

998
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,099
um so at one level below blockchains as

999
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,320
well as a permissioned version of

1000
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,060
blockchains

1001
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,800
you get to keep all the security goodies

1002
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,660
from the level above but you get to

1003
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,760
close the doors a little bit on who can

1004
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,140
actually contribute to a network like

1005
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,980
this

1006
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,260
so

1007
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,180
just a bit of an elaboration as well of

1008
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,540
what that tool actually brings us

1009
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,880
um hopefully most of the people in here

1010
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
will know of the data structure of

1011
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,020
singling linked list where each item

1012
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,780
refers to the previous one or the next

1013
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,680
one

1014
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,660
um in this case it's it's referring

1015
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,820
backwards instead of forwards

1016
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,140
um

1017
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,099
each entry into the Ledger

1018
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,099
um has a hash associated with it for

1019
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,599
those that don't know what hashes that's

1020
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,820
a one-way function that takes in any

1021
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,700
level of input and gives a fixed length

1022
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,079
of output

1023
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,599
um that's consistent so the same garbage

1024
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,460
data coming in or which results in the

1025
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,560
same hash coming out

1026
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,060
um

1027
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,700
just to touch some power draw as well

1028
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,619
um as a bit of an elaboration before we

1029
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,020
completely swap off of blockchains

1030
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,560
um this is the power draw of the

1031
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,880
ethereum network

1032
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,260
[Music]

1033
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,660
and then at one point it completely

1034
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,760
bottomed out

1035
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,520
and that's from like just going back

1036
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,940
a year from a couple of days ago so

1037
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,180
the amount or the analogy they use

1038
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,920
um is the difference between the Eiffel

1039
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,300
Tower

1040
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,720
um and a Lego figurine and that's how

1041
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,619
far the the power draw dropped where uh

1042
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,660
in terms of terrible hours

1043
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,440
um that the overall Network consumes but

1044
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,079
if we're deploying our own one

1045
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,480
um in order to establish where all these

1046
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,579
pieces of media came from what

1047
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,380
specifically would we want to store on

1048
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,060
it

1049
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,740
um

1050
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,339
the the best ideas here would be a hash

1051
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,640
of the sensor input

1052
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
um just because again a hash is a

1053
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,500
consistent length of output that's quite

1054
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,900
easy to store in a ledger like this as

1055
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,660
opposed to the whole media item itself

1056
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,720
um some information as well on who the

1057
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,980
Creator is

1058
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,680
um the device that it was created from

1059
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,900
uh going back to my phone as an example

1060
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,359
the device information might be the the

1061
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,760
phone's model but then specifically

1062
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,460
which camera on the phone and the

1063
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,579
settings of which that camera

1064
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,040
um was at at the same with capture as

1065
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,359
well

1066
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,760
um and the more of this information that

1067
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,740
you sort of try and Pile in the harder

1068
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,540
it will get to fake of course when you

1069
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,000
go back to the idea of degenerative AI

1070
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,099
stuff yes they can generate a face now

1071
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,140
but then

1072
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,619
you're you're adding more information

1073
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:24,420
and that they need to very specifically

1074
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,579
replicate

1075
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,040
um it's just it's adding to the

1076
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,300
complexity

1077
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,160
um and the whole system that you would

1078
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,280
want and a digital provenance sale

1079
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,700
fashion would be you're tracking the

1080
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,220
light photons coming in to the camera at

1081
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,540
the very start and you're wanting to

1082
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,200
track it all the way to the end consumer

1083
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,040
um

1084
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,720
so

1085
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,000
the main points are that you're wanting

1086
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,579
to secure that capture device as much as

1087
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,160
possible and as soon as the image is

1088
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,140
captured you want it to be fingerprinted

1089
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,339
and securely held within the device

1090
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,839
um

1091
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,359
you'd want to store it in a distributed

1092
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:07,619
Ledger

1093
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,140
um in order to keep it public for

1094
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,079
everyone to see that record of creation

1095
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,540
um and understands

1096
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,540
and knowing that the technology there

1097
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,420
doesn't allow for malicious edits and

1098
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,819
without it being transparent due to The

1099
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:27,660
Ledger section of that technology

1100
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,339
um

1101
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,800
of course for people to use the system

1102
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,720
it needs to be transparent clear what's

1103
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,420
happening and clearly describing to the

1104
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,160
end user what

1105
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
um is actually the assurances the system

1106
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,880
provides so ensuring that the the user

1107
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,240
interface makes that clear and it

1108
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,460
it explains everything to the best of

1109
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,900
disability

1110
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,640
um

1111
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,520
and of course you need the assurances

1112
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,280
that the systems underlying Technologies

1113
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,780
are all

1114
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,420
um all the information is held securely

1115
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,740
every step

1116
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,240
um

1117
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,880
the devices May initially be served

1118
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,099
pre-service Secrets

1119
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,119
um

1120
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,640
this will just ensure that we know who

1121
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,380
it was that actually took the photo and

1122
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,440
how it got to us for example

1123
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,480
we ensure that the hashing algorithms at

1124
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,839
plate are going to not result in

1125
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,260
collisions uh or duplicate outputs

1126
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,940
effectively

1127
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,180
from unique inputs

1128
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,640
we need to also ensure that all of the

1129
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,980
data is held securely both in transit

1130
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,460
and at rest

1131
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,200
and there's plenty of practical issues

1132
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,420
that could come from a system like this

1133
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,300
and that would need to be addressed but

1134
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,440
um

1135
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,500
this is all part of you know claiming

1136
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,900
that it's not the the magic answer for

1137
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,420
all the problems we are seeing but it's

1138
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,920
something that would also get worked on

1139
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,099
and very similar to the systems of

1140
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,440
pre-saned executables for things like

1141
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,000
installing

1142
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,760
your

1143
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,380
software on a home computer

1144
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,619
and you want to just ensure that this

1145
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:16,200
information there is keeping you as safe

1146
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,839
as possible as far as possible

1147
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:20,040
um

1148
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,780
so anchoring

1149
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,660
as we refer to when you put it on the

1150
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,460
distributed Ledger

1151
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,920
um should happen as soon as possible as

1152
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,680
close to the sensor where possible

1153
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,640
um so in the case of slightly Dumber

1154
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,599
cameras as opposed to fill on

1155
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,500
smartphones you may want to just

1156
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,859
information say even via like the SMS

1157
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,380
Network as soon as possible just to get

1158
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,380
those assurances in as fast as possible

1159
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,240
um

1160
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,660
the consumer again needs to be able to

1161
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,960
verify this at the end result and

1162
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,300
validating that no edits have taken

1163
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,920
place and again will are

1164
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,839
being able to interpret the assurances

1165
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,440
that come with a system like this

1166
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,300
um of course even going back to the

1167
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,760
newspaper example as well

1168
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,920
not all images will fit in the newspaper

1169
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,819
column

1170
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,760
and there is legitimate cases of editing

1171
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,040
like cropping and that needs to be

1172
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,619
considered so that the images will fit

1173
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,480
in an appropriate space or have been

1174
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,300
slightly rotated to ensure that the

1175
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,020
person is standing straight for example

1176
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,000
um

1177
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,060
we then would of course need to rely on

1178
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,940
secure input devices

1179
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,440
um so ensuring that the system is secure

1180
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,119
as a whole and that the individual

1181
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,339
devices are tamper resistant or tamper

1182
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,440
evident

1183
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,319
um and then again coming back to that

1184
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:59,819
transparent UI you must work on

1185
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:04,260
a system that's clear and easy to use so

1186
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,119
that trust can be formed between you and

1187
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,640
the user and working on all of this Tech

1188
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,460
in the open as well will provide provide

1189
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,579
a lot of that trust so

1190
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,260
yeah

1191
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,540
um an example here of a system that

1192
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,579
would be

1193
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:22,380
relating to this would be one of the

1194
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,700
ones that I've been working on with my

1195
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,800
team at open Origins

1196
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,740
um it's a IOS app

1197
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,900
um where you're able to just capture

1198
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,900
images within the app and we build up as

1199
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,880
much metadata as possible around the

1200
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,579
image from the sensors data available as

1201
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,700
early as possible uh we get it fired

1202
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,839
into

1203
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:45,060
a DLT

1204
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,339
um so that from the point that it's been

1205
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:49,800
captured in there you can assure that no

1206
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,960
edits have taken place

1207
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,420
um on by the time you consume that piece

1208
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,099
of information

1209
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,980
um authenticity information on what

1210
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,960
device it was captured on

1211
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,319
when it was captured when we got in our

1212
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,839
system at the location these things are

1213
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:08,339
captured in as well

1214
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,859
in this case it was a teacher's strike

1215
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:12,300
in London

1216
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,079
um so then of course at the end

1217
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
um you

1218
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,579
fill in that

1219
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:23,640
accepted edits scenario you've got

1220
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,099
things like the QR code to link back to

1221
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,260
the original asset on our site so that

1222
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,720
you can for example if you have trust in

1223
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,099
this system you can fall back

1224
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,560
from perhaps another site where the

1225
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,839
image may have been pressed or

1226
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,060
manipulated in some fashion through the

1227
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,579
upload process there

1228
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:45,420
um

1229
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,359
so yeah we

1230
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,300
we see that the generative AI sort of

1231
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,359
offensive tool set is quite heavy and

1232
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,980
there's a lot going on they've had a lot

1233
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,500
more time to get up to Pace

1234
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,540
um so it's a bit of a David and Goliath

1235
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,400
trying to catch up to a system like that

1236
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,380
and build up a system of transparency

1237
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,800
and security and what's been quite uh

1238
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
security Lacks

1239
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,920
uh

1240
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,400
system in general photography as a whole

1241
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
um

1242
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,960
yeah I'm gonna skip this slide here but

1243
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,020
that's uh the main that's a long shot of

1244
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,119
it I'd love to hear questions I've got

1245
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,339
cadburys cream eggs I'll happily throw

1246
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,440
it people if you ask a really good

1247
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,420
question or if you're being really

1248
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,300
annoying or aiming your head and

1249
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,300
but I've I've been told off for through

1250
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,420
or the idea of throwing them so uh yeah

1251
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,800
you'll just need to come down at the end

1252
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,359
to collect them

1253
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,140
um

1254
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,819
the

1255
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,520
final point I just wanted to make before

1256
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,000
going on to questions is that frankly

1257
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,940
the app it was an it's a bit of a closed

1258
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,680
Source State at the moment or closed

1259
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,740
Source uh closed entry State and we've

1260
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,480
got envelope Code system if you're

1261
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,059
interested in having a look at the app

1262
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,980
um you can scan the QR code it's taking

1263
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,900
you to my link tree but I've got links

1264
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,380
from there and to the appropriate page

1265
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,359
in the App Store

1266
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,880
and separately

1267
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,760
um for the students and first second

1268
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,440
third year we're looking for brand

1269
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,140
ambassadors again the link will be part

1270
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,540
of there I'll leave this slide up

1271
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,579
um now as we go to questions so yeah

1272
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:32,059
thank you

1273
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,859
thank you

1274
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,140
very much

1275
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,339
yeah so the question was am I not

1276
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,559
or the example I gave earlier in regard

1277
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,160
to Kodak and the staged imagery and

1278
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,920
that's a fair point that a system like

1279
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,480
this could give and false

1280
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,359
assurances in a staged environment but

1281
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,220
all of that extra metadata as well

1282
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,540
that's being provided through the

1283
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,540
transparent UI would hopefully help

1284
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,359
and reduce cases of for example stage

1285
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,760
content getting through the net

1286
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,440
um arming the user with as much

1287
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,380
information as possible is kind of key

1288
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,760
um which I might not have made clear

1289
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,040
through the metadata and transparent UI

1290
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,280
part but yeah the hope is that the more

1291
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,859
information you have the better informed

1292
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:48,300
you can be and the better choices you

1293
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,440
can make

1294
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,359
and you can rely a lot more in the

1295
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,000
system than doing all of the information

1296
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,339
and time protecting yourself

1297
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,359
so yeah good question thank you

1298
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,900
yep

1299
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,060
[Music]

1300
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,880
so the question was if you were to

1301
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,760
upload it through a separate device onto

1302
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,440
your phone and then try and get it into

1303
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,440
the app so the main point of what we're

1304
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,119
trying to do with frankly is sort of

1305
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,200
restricting the capture in the first

1306
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,119
place so you can only use it through the

1307
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,400
in-app camera very similar to how

1308
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,440
Snapchat was quite early on before it

1309
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,780
had the gallery access

1310
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,540
um so the idea is yeah the the content

1311
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,420
is assured because we were there at the

1312
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,940
point of capture to almost say like yeah

1313
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,720
perhaps so good good question thank you

1314
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,460
interrupts

1315
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,119
yep

1316
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,420
yeah so the question again just to recap

1317
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,980
was

1318
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,559
um how do you handle low no signal

1319
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,619
situations where someone captures it

1320
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:39,540
um initially and trying to get that to

1321
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,940
the DLT as fast as possible

1322
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,059
um so especially for the low signal

1323
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,559
um the idea of getting that fingerprint

1324
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,359
up as quickly as possible is super

1325
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,579
important because from that you can

1326
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,220
assure no edits have taken place because

1327
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,140
the way the hashing algorithm

1328
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,420
fundamentally works is any edits would

1329
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,119
immediately change that fingerprint

1330
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:03,359
um no signal you're then also relying on

1331
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,540
strong on device security and signing it

1332
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,579
on the hardware level as fast as

1333
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,339
possible and height of yeah hiding that

1334
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,500
information into the hardware

1335
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,839
um until such a time you can upload the

1336
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,020
full uh or even that initial fingerprint

1337
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,140
and then the film wanted further on

1338
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,319
um the example might a good example

1339
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,540
might be Google photos you take a photo

1340
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,720
on your device uh you take 10 more it

1341
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,160
doesn't necessarily upload them all

1342
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,780
until you're on for example Wi-Fi

1343
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,400
connection because it doesn't want to

1344
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,640
absolutely check your data so yeah

1345
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,098
good question though thank you yep

1346
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,400
yeah so the question was in regards to

1347
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,880
the centralization of the diagram I give

1348
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,880
um for the distributed Ledger um

1349
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,940
yeah we obviously aim to work with for

1350
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,819
example uh BBC on major news

1351
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,460
organizations so that we are not the

1352
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,780
source of truth because we are

1353
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,400
fundamentally are building this system

1354
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,500
so that we wouldn't be the source of

1355
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,940
truth that will be shared amongst

1356
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,520
multiple organizations ideally with

1357
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,339
different views so for example in the US

1358
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,559
you have your major news organizations

1359
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,079
on each side of the debate uh having

1360
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,660
both of them contributing to the upkeep

1361
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,180
of a system like this would ensure no

1362
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,300
biased content really getting in as well

1363
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,480
um so yeah the aim is using dlts and

1364
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,460
this uh

1365
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,220
specifically permissioned blockchains as

1366
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,460
an example of have invading trusted

1367
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,800
sources to help maintain the system and

1368
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,720
not just bearing the way of all

1369
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,579
ourselves so yeah it's a good question

1370
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:02,180
thank you

1371
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,460
um Danny stop now yes kill no worries

1372
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,380
well thank you

1373
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,510
um it's good Chan

1374
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,339
