1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,660
uh hello everyone hope you've all had a

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,580
good day today uh plenty of good talks

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,740
across all three tracks

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
um thanks for letting us speak for today

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
and finish the finish for the closing

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,260
keynote So today we're going to talk

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,920
about uh growing as an MS SP sock

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,960
um the challenges that we've faced

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,160
um and then also what we wanted to do

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,560
was kind of give people more of an idea

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
about what happens in a sort of

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,660
different roles and what to expect we

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,980
could have felt that we because we both

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,300
went to abertillas we'll introduce

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,040
ourselves in a few minutes

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
um that there wasn't as much information

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,180
about blue teaming and socks in general

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,579
as we would have hoped and hopefully

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,700
this can give more of an insight into it

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,960
um so let's get started

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,940
so just to introduce myself I'm Donnie

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,200
Henderson

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,780
um I as I just mentioned I went to

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,140
abertay in 2016 I did the MSC ethical

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,780
hacking and computer security

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,340
from there I went into an in-house sock

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,140
at a large Bank

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,939
um stayed in the financial sector in

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,260
Edinburgh moving into security

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,000
architecture and then vulnerability

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,140
management

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,540
uh and then a year and a half ago moved

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,820
to Quorum cyber uh where I'm now one of

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,500
the top managers

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,299
um what we kind of want to talk about is

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,680
that you know there's different roles

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,180
out there

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
um as I mentioned we'll talk about a few

39
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,540
of them we've all gonna have we both had

40
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,479
a kind of a variety of different roles

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,299
on uh yeah so that's myself anyway hey

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,799
everyone I'm Stan

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,460
um

44
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,920
I started in albertine in 2015 as a

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,799
Computing student at end of my first

46
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,079
year sort of um I've moved to data

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,340
hacking degree because I thought it was

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,799
a little bit more interesting

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,900
um I've then done the accelerated degree

50
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,740
and I graduated for like the honors in

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,579
2018 and from then started my first rose

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,520
and soccer analyst and a large um bang

53
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,740
for an in-house sock as Danny said just

54
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,020
now basically at the time I had no idea

55
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,700
what I'm going to be doing I just know I

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,040
was joining a security Operation Center

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,259
gonna look at some stuff

58
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,639
um but yeah there was not much

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,860
information out there but I'll give it a

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,180
go

61
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,120
um I started as a analyst stayed there

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,220
for a while then I got promoted to a

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,319
senior analyst and then I decided I

64
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,760
wanted to do something different than

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,700
in-house stuff so I moved to an mssp I

66
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,319
was a principal secured down was there

67
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
and I helped grow the stock improve

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,680
processes and and after about a year and

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
a bit there I moved to Quorum because I

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,140
thought it was a little bit more

71
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,700
exciting and

72
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,739
quite small company that was like

73
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,860
growing so um I joined last May as a

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,840
senior stock analyst and there

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,760
a little bit about about Forum was

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,580
founded in Edinburgh 2016 and that was

77
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,080
one of the fastest growing cyber

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,780
security companies in the UK and it was

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,019
just a few employees in 2017

80
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,180
um a few years later I had 75 employees

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,019
in 2020 and then as of now we're about

82
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,080
180 people and Counting um obviously

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,660
we're growing a lot because there's a

84
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,280
a lot of cyber security stuff but good

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,659
happening out there so there's a lot of

86
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,459
new clients being on boarded and

87
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,680
therefore we need more people to look

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,379
after them and last year

89
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,260
um we recruited 12 graduates for our

90
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,019
grad program hoping that this year is

91
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,239
going to be about double that

92
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,980
um but there's more information in the

93
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,659
website

94
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,340
so I thought we'd just talk about a

95
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,560
brief history of Subs the first thing

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
that is salts were found in no no no no

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,580
one does the wrong one Danny

98
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,799
ah there we go really glad at least one

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,060
person laughed at that because we were

100
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,500
really worried about that

101
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,819
um no but let's actually talk about a

102
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,260
brief history of socks um obviously

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,760
we've only been in the industry a few

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,819
years but uh it could be really be it

105
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,920
can you know send back to the kind of

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,680
mid 1990s um back then it was mainly

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,239
Health monitoring it was the

108
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,220
availability of devices

109
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,140
um and then you know various alerts

110
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,379
based off of that uh incident detection

111
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,459
um between 1985 to 2006 uh you could

112
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,400
kind of go into reactive monitoring

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,260
um this is when you would see the

114
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,939
implementation of different solutions

115
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,540
like antivirus intrusion detection

116
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,358
um they would add to the kind of number

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
of signals that you got in that would

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
give you more accurate results for

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,660
um you know alerts and whatnot

120
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,759
um when you go into this phase you go

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,620
more away from the original

122
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,900
implementation of salts which was made

123
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,240
like in a military base uh you moved

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
into kind of like large Enterprises uh

125
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,919
backs that kind of things

126
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,479
um you then move into proactive

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,680
monitoring

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
um so this is kind of when uh the

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
introduction of mssps which we'll go on

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
to discuss in a few minutes started

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
um so uh the you know it was the

132
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,300
introduction of seam tools and DLP

133
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
um which allowed more and more signals

134
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,860
to be congregated one in a solution

135
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,280
um and then acted upon from there

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,020
um and then kind of in the last few

137
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,639
years as I'm sure you've all you know

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,199
heard it's there's been more

139
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,020
implementation of uh kind of Automation

140
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,520
and machine learning so that would be

141
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,800
proactive monitoring what's more uh

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
automation on the side of it

143
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
uh this tonight hero made it more

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,060
available to kind of smaller Enterprises

145
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,280
and businesses

146
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,060
um

147
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,380
whereas before it was more logical

148
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,080
so the two types of socks there are

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,060
basically um you have your own in-house

150
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,539
self and you also have msbs so and then

151
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,460
in-house sock basically what you're

152
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,780
going to have is going to be a

153
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,000
department organization usually part of

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,460
it and that will be dedicated

155
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,380
specifically to monitoring the the

156
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,539
company's Network and look for any

157
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,340
security

158
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,160
um events happening and investigating as

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,780
as needed

160
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,919
with the the need to have 24 7 coverage

161
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,360
you need to have

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,979
um bigger experience you need to be

163
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,080
looking at a lot of stuff

164
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,840
um this is not really a feasible option

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,940
for especially smaller companies

166
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
um so that's why

167
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,539
um as I mentioned in the previous slide

168
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,720
basically the need for mssp came in

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,759
so with a with an atmosphere which is a

170
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,400
managed security service provider

171
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,539
um what you've got is basically an

172
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,460
external company that will do all your

173
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,639
security needs such as Autumn

174
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,460
um so with the specifically for the sock

175
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,620
what we have basically is we're going to

176
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,300
have the 24 7 monitoring you're going to

177
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,000
have the expertise of analysts that um

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,220
are looking through a variety of

179
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,319
different clients

180
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,600
you're going to have access to a variety

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
of incident response offensive security

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,460
just different services that you

183
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,740
as a small companies probably won't be

184
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,020
able to afford and this is also a key

185
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,600
key difference between the two so and I

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,580
didn't have so you're typically going to

187
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,319
be a smaller team and you're going to

188
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,539
have smaller budgetably ways you're

189
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,160
going to have a smaller

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,560
um tools like basically less tools to to

191
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,080
use within your company and so most of

192
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,639
the time is seen as a cost to the

193
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,780
business

194
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,600
um whereas the nemesispy you have a

195
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
typically a larger team is obviously

196
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
going to be looking across a variety of

197
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,819
companies you need the resourcing to be

198
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,220
able to to do that and you're going to

199
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,240
have a bigger budget you're going to

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
have access to slightly different Tools

201
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,599
in order to be able to do your job

202
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,680
better

203
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,500
um and obviously as as a service

204
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,360
provider the revenue comes from from

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
customers so it's not seen sort of a

206
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
cost of the business and there are pros

207
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,440
and cons for both as well

208
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,960
um depending on the um then household

209
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,460
you might have a little bit bigger say

210
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,039
on how the security is done in your

211
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,780
company in terms of like processing

212
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,759
compliance and stuff like that and

213
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,699
sometimes that's not always the case

214
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,919
um so depending on the need there's

215
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
there's pros and cons for both in the

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,440
house and an MSS resource

217
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
so starting your career and I saw um

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,639
what can you expect usually what people

219
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,160
start in uh in the socks are either so

220
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,440
analysts or soccer engineer

221
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,479
those so this whole Canal is basically

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,819
pretty much as the um or the people that

223
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,620
are on the front line what you do is

224
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,479
they'll they'll monitor the 3r security

225
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,020
alerts and editing that comes in for

226
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,840
typically and the um in our stock will

227
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,240
have a variety of clients who monitor

228
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,220
the networks alerts come in they'll go

229
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,620
ahead three other investigator

230
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,539
um they will need to communicate

231
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,520
sometimes with the clients whatever is

232
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,958
happening if there's a cyber incident

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,000
happening and they might need to speak

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,860
with a client confirm What's

235
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,320
um what's the deal explain to them the

236
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,060
situation

237
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,600
um they'll also be um working with other

238
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,519
people in the team to

239
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,279
uh more than like the developer

240
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,620
playbooks develop um thread hunts

241
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,660
depending on what emerging threads they

242
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,240
are and overall just collaborating with

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,700
the team as a whole and also with with

244
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,080
other teams which we'll cover a little

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,339
bit later on

246
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,380
as a soccer engineer

247
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,440
um the primarily needs for them is to

248
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,060
basically look at the back end of the

249
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,620
service and make sure everything runs

250
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,720
smoothly and that goes from anything

251
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,720
from tuning alerts to which basically

252
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,420
will improve the service and

253
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,160
that you can you can make sure that

254
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,779
everything runs smoothly

255
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,240
um and they'll be reviewing proactively

256
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
alerts so that you make sure

257
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
everything's fine there

258
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,500
um they'll also be identifying

259
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
improvements for specific rule sites

260
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,339
that will actually trigger um on the

261
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,680
back of variety of events so then the

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,440
analysts can investigate them and as

263
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,360
well they'll also be triaging emerging

264
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,339
issues within the cell can just work

265
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,420
with with

266
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,680
um the whole engineering team to

267
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,360
prioritize stuff that needs to happen in

268
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,459
order to keep the service running as

269
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,119
best as it can

270
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,200
um in terms of procreation opportunity

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,240
in the sock obviously there's the senior

272
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
versions of both of those

273
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,740
um the senior stock analysts

274
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,320
the information there kind of covers

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,779
both senior and principles like the pen

276
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,880
it really depends on the company you're

277
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,220
working with role names are not

278
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,100
everything sometimes one row can be

279
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,779
doing one thing in one company then the

280
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,100
same row and a different company can be

281
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,080
doing five different things on top of it

282
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,120
but primarily the the role for the

283
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,459
senior analyst is basically to

284
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,800
help normal analysts whenever they have

285
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,660
needs for that basically they act as an

286
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,220
escalation point

287
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,779
um the amount of them and support them

288
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,279
whenever there's a need for them make

289
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,899
sure that they progress as they should

290
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,180
and they also look into improving the

291
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,519
overall quality of alerts and just look

292
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,959
into

293
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,880
how best

294
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,399
um they can improve the quality of the

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,140
of the service

296
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,320
um we also work with like a variety of

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,300
clients on various engagements

298
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
um in order to basically make sure that

299
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,660
the client gets what they need and

300
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,000
everything that they need to be

301
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
receiving from a service perspective is

302
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,620
happening as it should be

303
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,480
um we also do

304
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,459
um as a you know analyst basically also

305
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,959
involved in a lot of the developing

306
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,579
internal process and making sure those

307
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,380
are following making sure

308
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,880
um the service basically progresses

309
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,700
doesn't stay stagnated there's always

310
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,040
need to improve something

311
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
um for a socket for a senior soccer

312
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,300
engineer as pretty much all the the

313
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,339
engineer tasks that they're doing that I

314
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,959
mentioned earlier on however they're

315
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,240
also going to be organizing and running

316
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,620
the day-to-day stuff there's a little

317
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,959
bit more management oriented

318
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,860
um

319
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,680
but it's pretty much just the senior

320
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,060
version of it again

321
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,620
um acting as an escalation point into

322
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,519
someone with a little bit more

323
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,740
experience that can help inventor

324
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,720
um Junior engineers

325
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,279
obviously those are not just the two

326
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,660
roles but those are the most prevalent

327
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,620
ones

328
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,839
um from the soldiers a lot of people go

329
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,120
and do incident response they can go

330
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,740
into digital forensics some people

331
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,120
decide to go and deal with the

332
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,640
compliance and dop like the data Lake um

333
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,540
data loss prevention there we go

334
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
um side of things so depending on

335
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,440
depending on what you want to do there's

336
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,240
a variety of opportunities to to develop

337
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,260
so obviously the title of the

338
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,640
presentation is challenges of a growing

339
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,160
mssp shout out to chat GPT for helping

340
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,959
us out with the title of that

341
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,760
um I really like this diagram here it

342
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
kind of shows that you know in every

343
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,240
operations team probably in every

344
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,100
business uh there's always challenges

345
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,380
that will then feed into other ones uh

346
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,360
which will then feed into other ones

347
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,160
um the four that we want to focus on

348
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
today uh were customer service

349
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,839
resourcing technology and solutions and

350
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,060
then also training

351
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,220
so customer service

352
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,920
um in my opinion uh well in our opinion

353
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,959
uh what's just as important as technical

354
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,240
skills is soft skills um I think we've

355
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
talked about this uh to the people that

356
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,660
we've seen at the recruitment stands um

357
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,220
there's a few talks I've seen have also

358
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,019
touched on this as well

359
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,100
um building and maintaining

360
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
relationships is so important in

361
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
operations especially in mssps with an

362
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,399
mssp you have multiple customers from

363
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,720
multiple different backgrounds different

364
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,180
security knowledges and they'll have

365
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,980
different needs as well and then you

366
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,600
know they might also

367
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,260
um

368
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,720
have more collaboration with you

369
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
um so communicating with confidence is a

370
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
very key skill as well

371
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,220
um as I just mentioned there's going to

372
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,079
be companies from different Industries

373
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,000
uh and that will have different reasons

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,040
for uh acquiring your service and they

375
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,060
might have different

376
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,860
um levels of knowledge so you have to

377
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,600
tailor your language to suit the

378
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,339
audience for example if you're dealing

379
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,399
with a large uh Financial firm you might

380
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,620
be dealing with someone that has a lot

381
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,360
more security knowledge than someone

382
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,639
that works for a small charity

383
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,200
um or you know

384
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,899
um just another industry that might have

385
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,540
a different outlook on security

386
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,540
so one thing to always remember and I

387
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,920
think that this is good advice for

388
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,019
anyone that's um you know leaving

389
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,820
University like going into the first job

390
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,040
I would have liked this advice myself is

391
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,560
when you go into somewhere like an mssp

392
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
remember that you're the expert you're

393
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
the one that they've hired

394
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,139
um to do a job and to give your

395
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,660
expertise on something not everyone

396
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,180
needs to know all everything that's why

397
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,920
you work as a team

398
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
um but being able to communicate not

399
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
only with a customer but also with your

400
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
peers uh we'll definitely help you out

401
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
with this so collaboration I just talked

402
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,980
about that briefly

403
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,959
um what makes the service better is if

404
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
you're constantly collaborating with uh

405
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,040
the customer and being able to improve

406
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,279
on the service that you're given to them

407
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,779
uh this can be through regular

408
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,399
operations calls

409
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,720
where you can

410
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,480
um you know convey any concerns that you

411
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,600
have uh you can pass over intelligence

412
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,820
um any sort of uh you know scanning

413
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,100
activity that's going on any any issues

414
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,139
that they may have with certain users or

415
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,820
any threats they may have had a tip on

416
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,519
um and you know just an example of

417
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,980
um great customer service that we've

418
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,540
experienced and building entertainment

419
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,639
relationships we had a customer recently

420
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,540
was on boarded and because of

421
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,639
um a tactical reason uh there was an

422
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,500
incident which caused us to onboard and

423
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,139
very quickly uh We've since maintained

424
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,579
quite a healthy relationship with them

425
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,740
constantly uh collaborating with them

426
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,860
sharing knowledge and this has then

427
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,540
caused them to

428
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,880
um speak to others in their industry and

429
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,920
provide good reference which is then got

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,720
a small business

431
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,579
um or business means more customers

432
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,660
which means that we learn more

433
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,339
so the next thing I want to talk about

434
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,720
is resourcing

435
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,459
uh selecting the right people is

436
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,500
obviously very important

437
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
um we you look for a wide variety of

438
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,720
skill sets and the reason I say that is

439
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,100
it's important to remember that not

440
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,380
everyone is going to know everything

441
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,899
um but you know I certainly don't

442
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,000
um it's good to know that who you have

443
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,980
in your team that you can turn to for

444
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,360
certain things

445
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,079
um

446
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,480
you also should under understand an

447
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,399
attacker's mindset

448
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,740
um and also be empathetic to your

449
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,660
customer situation we need to remember

450
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,820
that when a customer is coming to you

451
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,860
for support or when they ask you for a

452
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,600
service and there's a reason for that

453
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,120
they're either concerned about something

454
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,480
and they're under legal obligation to

455
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,820
have you there or some similar reason to

456
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,600
that

457
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
so this diagram here on the right I like

458
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,740
this so

459
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
so what this is trying to convey is

460
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,600
um analysts are obviously primarily

461
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,339
there for incident handling they're

462
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,220
looking to investigations but that

463
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,320
information doesn't just stop there so

464
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,199
this um depicts uh kind of life cycle so

465
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,639
the information that you might get from

466
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,920
an incident that's been handled uh could

467
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
then go into threat intelligence which

468
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,420
then goes into use case development so

469
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,300
the the information that you get from

470
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,560
this Analyst at the point of the

471
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,420
investigation doesn't stop there it

472
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,100
could go all the way through uh through

473
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,779
to use case development and the reason

474
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,600
that that is is because an analyst would

475
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,380
um

476
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,880
safely did the same type of

477
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,160
investigation repeatedly um or if they

478
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,079
spotted a pattern they might be able to

479
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,179
provide more context for the next time

480
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,579
that this happened

481
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,839
when we are looking at selecting the

482
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,699
right people you need to we need to try

483
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,140
and look and see if we can find someone

484
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,459
that's kind of well-rounded that might

485
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,299
have

486
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,000
analytical skills that would extend past

487
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,119
just uh investigations

488
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,380
so

489
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,679
another challenge is balancing head

490
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,780
counts so this happens in every business

491
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,419
especially in operations it's a constant

492
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,400
balance between the total required

493
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,980
output that you need and how many staff

494
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,539
that would require

495
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,200
um

496
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
I think it's fair to say that everyone's

497
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,039
had the cliche of cyber security is

498
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,260
constantly evolving changing

499
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
um that is something that is constantly

500
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,220
in the minds of people that are

501
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,220
recruiting because not only do you have

502
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,760
to adapt to various threats you have to

503
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,660
um

504
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,140
base your resourcing off of that fact so

505
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,660
if there's a you know over the past few

506
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,580
years artificial intelligence has become

507
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,320
more important that might mean in the

508
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,960
next few years that would be one of the

509
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,080
main factors in recruiting it's a

510
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,200
constantly evolving landscape

511
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,340
uh another thing

512
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,160
is adapting to customers coverage

513
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,200
requirements so

514
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,460
um at the core of it a security

515
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,919
operations center is there to provide

516
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,320
security coverage for our customers

517
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,980
estate uh over various time periods uh

518
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,700
Quorum and most Subs have customers the

519
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,980
most nssp so I have customers around the

520
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,039
UK or internationally

521
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,539
um so these are going to be on different

522
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,760
time zones they'll need different

523
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,299
various levels of coverage

524
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,720
um so sometimes it might be 20 24x7

525
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,700
sometimes just through specific

526
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
um outside of business hours things like

527
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,120
that so that's something that we always

528
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,199
have to bear in mind

529
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,220
the next thing I'm going to talk about

530
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,020
is basically training and knowledge

531
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,820
sharing so

532
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,740
obviously because I've covered a lot of

533
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,299
companies have went

534
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,660
um remote so that put us specifically

535
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,400
um interesting challenge in actually

536
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,380
training stuff and especially when it

537
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,960
comes to people that are new to

538
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,039
um do socks so um it's a specific

539
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,660
challenge being effective while being

540
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,919
remote as well because obviously

541
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,480
everyone has different

542
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,880
um styles of learning then everyone has

543
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,860
preferred method that they prefer to

544
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,780
learn so

545
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,820
basically training people in the same

546
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,220
manner doesn't always help absolutely

547
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,080
everyone

548
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,620
so we have through experience through

549
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,960
some mistakes errors

550
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,299
um we've managed to come up with what I

551
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,940
think are quite robust training plan

552
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,980
um which basically made we make sure

553
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,799
every every new hours that we get

554
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,880
um

555
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
a strain up to the the same standard

556
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,600
through the means that actually help

557
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,460
them rather than just having a it was a

558
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,799
specific one way that we just sort of

559
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,080
convey that information

560
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,380
um on top of that we also um have

561
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,320
continuous continuous mentoring and as

562
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,600
mentioned earlier on basically primarily

563
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,480
from the senior analyst to the offer

564
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
um support and to do a bit of a little

565
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
bit of quality control

566
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,640
um

567
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,919
with the continuous mentoring basically

568
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,780
again the whole point is to make sure

569
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,760
that downloads provide the best service

570
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,460
they can to to the customer that their

571
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,679
investigations are on point so they

572
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,720
don't mess stuff they have basically

573
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,940
they pay attention to the details and

574
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,760
just share the knowledge that the senior

575
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,480
um

576
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,460
see our team will go have through the

577
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,840
years of experience they either sharing

578
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,520
with the general analysts and they can

579
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,179
actually learn from that and we also do

580
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,559
um Quality Control just to make sure

581
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
everything's in Top Notch

582
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,820
um I don't mean through checking

583
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,559
investigation speaking with homeless

584
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,419
making sure everything's all right and

585
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,480
just overall looking through the work to

586
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
make sure everything's is the basically

587
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,299
the customers are getting the best

588
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,100
service they can

589
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,020
um there's also a lot of collaboration

590
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,220
between

591
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,380
um between different teams so as Danny

592
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,760
mentioned earlier on anything that

593
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,200
happens in the sock doesn't just stay in

594
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,880
the sock that is uh contextual

595
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,559
information that could be used by other

596
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,760
teams

597
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,780
um and that collaboration is is really

598
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,880
needed to make sure that

599
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,520
um specific stuff that happen for one

600
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,020
client might be relevant to a different

601
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,320
client so when we have the

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,580
the collaboration between different

603
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,520
teams for example the customer success

604
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,500
team what do what they can do is if

605
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,480
there's something specific emerging

606
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
today for one client that we've seen if

607
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,559
they manage where a few different

608
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,880
clients that are in the same industry

609
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,080
obviously they can speak with them and

610
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,179
they can tell them right we've seen this

611
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,419
happen in sort of your industry

612
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,159
what we could do for you is we can do

613
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,500
XYZ you can look into this one

614
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,780
um just to basically make sure that we

615
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,640
don't just keep information in one place

616
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,380
it's shared with the wider team so then

617
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,900
we can help as many customers as we can

618
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,600
and um another important part of the

619
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,860
knowledge sharing is basically

620
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,140
documentation of processes

621
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,720
I'm sure a lot lots of you will know

622
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,539
basically documentation has really

623
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,159
needed part of everything

624
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
um when it comes to courseworks

625
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,580
obviously you have to write reports and

626
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,799
because this is the way of you conveying

627
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,600
the information that you've learned or

628
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,120
you've found so it's the same thing with

629
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,640
um msspot basically

630
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,220
um any process that our in place should

631
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,020
have a good documentation this ensures

632
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,659
that any anyone coming after you knows

633
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,580
exactly what needs to happen

634
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,360
um

635
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,059
basically every other team would be

636
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,740
aware of the exact process that takes

637
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,260
place so then everyone knows where the

638
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,600
different people involved in a specific

639
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
whether it's an investigation an

640
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
incident everyone knows what needs to

641
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,820
happen and everyone has uploaded about

642
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,799
it

643
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,940
I'm going to talk about a little bit

644
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,700
Technology Solutions as Danny said

645
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,760
um it's an ever-emerging landscape so we

646
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,140
have to keep up with the threat actors

647
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,020
in some shape or form so the main way

648
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,299
that the stock Works basically is we

649
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,640
have detection rules that we fire on

650
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,100
specific events happening we're going to

651
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,539
have a standard

652
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,240
um set case of rules that are based on

653
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,419
on just generic threads whether that's

654
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,120
unknown devices sign in the terms

655
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,880
authentication whatever so those will be

656
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,980
deployed across the customer base

657
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,980
however we we do have some bespoke um

658
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,780
rule sets for different clients

659
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,460
different Industries depending on the

660
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,200
threads um each of them they have and

661
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,380
depending on the threat model they have

662
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,960
um however all of those rules said

663
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,100
obviously they're going to trigger on

664
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,299
specific

665
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,159
um set of thresholds and something

666
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,799
actually happening however there's a lot

667
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,559
of stuff and a day-to-day business that

668
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,360
could trigger false positives just

669
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,400
benign activity that is expected to

670
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,679
occur but also has triggered

671
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,280
um

672
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
one of our alerts so in order to to

673
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620
fight that basically we have um tuning

674
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,780
of alerts as I mentioned earlier there's

675
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,720
both ad hoc and regular tuning depending

676
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,280
on the need of the client and depending

677
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,860
on how noisy they are

678
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,280
um and on the back of that we also have

679
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,820
automation that is there to enrich

680
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,559
alerts and make sure that it helps the

681
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,700
analysts to have all the information

682
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,280
needed so they are best prepared when

683
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,799
they're doing an investigation

684
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,240
and

685
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,400
as obviously earlier basically because

686
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
of the ever-changing thread landscape

687
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
different clients will basically will

688
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
use different vendors for their needs

689
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,539
and either it's firewalls IDs ips's

690
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,020
whatever you you want they will use a

691
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,760
variety of them not there's not going to

692
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
be many customers using the exact same

693
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,539
set of Technologies so

694
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,780
in order to basically keep up with that

695
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,120
um we need to be up to date with all the

696
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,679
documentation of it we need to be aware

697
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,080
of excuse me

698
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,880
what the customers are using and how

699
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,799
they're using it because on the back of

700
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,659
the information we receive from those

701
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,120
Technologies and those Solutions we need

702
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,980
to carry out our investigation and

703
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,360
that's why as Danny mentioned earlier

704
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,679
it's very good to have a good

705
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,240
communication with your client because

706
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,820
being upfront and knowing what they have

707
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,559
they will let you know what's happening

708
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,760
with the environment they will let you

709
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,140
know when there's new products and new

710
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,779
Solutions being deployed which will then

711
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,120
on the back of that help you have better

712
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,700
investigations and will help you do a

713
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,600
better analysis

714
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
um

715
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,279
as a little bits about threat

716
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,720
intelligence as well

717
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,779
um obviously with emerging threads um we

718
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,220
have a threat intelligence team that

719
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,679
will feed us information about emerging

720
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,779
threads and then we will go ahead and do

721
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,960
thread hunts and whether that's for a

722
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,760
specific customer again or the what the

723
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,080
whole industry and everyone we have in

724
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,520
that industry

725
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,860
um we're going to carry out thread hunts

726
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,360
and find out if there's anything

727
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,820
specifically happening and just

728
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,760
basically try and proactively um save

729
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,559
the customer

730
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,659
and some someone might be might be

731
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,880
wondering why is all this needed

732
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,000
um basically the need of all of this is

733
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,020
to

734
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,539
um basically lower the ticket fatigue

735
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,860
what it's called basically when

736
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,600
banalysts are investigating a lot of the

737
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,640
same alerts that are just benign but

738
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,320
it's false positive they're they're

739
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,559
noisy stuff that are just um

740
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,840
wasting time of actually quality um

741
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,580
investigations I can actually bring

742
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,460
suspicious and malicious events um up to

743
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,000
the surface so um has any uh mentioned

744
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,039
earlier on about the um

745
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,080
customers coming from instant response

746
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,000
this is one of the best examples for

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,679
this one whenever a customer comes in

748
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,480
from an incident responds into the stock

749
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
when they're on boarded um in order to

750
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,440
make sure we monitor

751
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,460
um everything we put them in a

752
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,500
heightened monitoring um schedule sort

753
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,380
of thing where we just throw

754
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,419
all the standard rules we have on them

755
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,159
to basically start alerting but we're

756
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
also going to add in some bespoke ones

757
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,340
specifically to the thread and

758
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,539
specifically to the Cyber incident

759
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,640
they're dealing with however what

760
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,740
happens is because they they go through

761
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,659
a rapid onboarding into our into our

762
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:13,740
service

763
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,900
um none of this is going to be tuned so

764
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,299
we're going to get a lot of alerts for

765
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,340
stuff that is benign just because we as

766
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,740
a new customer and because the there's a

767
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,539
need to immediately start monitoring to

768
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,100
make sure nothing else happens faster

769
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,500
past that incident there's going to be a

770
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,919
lot of noisy alerts that um basically

771
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,860
can sort of Hide Away actual malicious

772
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,200
activity so that's why we go through

773
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
tunings that's why we go through the

774
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,320
Automation and basically trying to

775
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,960
reduce the default's positive rate in

776
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,460
order to make sure that the only alerts

777
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,200
we're getting are actually quality

778
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,900
alerts that can bring up any suspicious

779
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,919
or

780
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,120
um malicious activities

781
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,400
that's all for us um we'll take some

782
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,120
questions right now

783
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,539
no questions

784
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,779
they've done pretty good job then yeah

785
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:10,679
yeah

786
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,700
um there's a little bit of a challenge

787
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,159
if anyone wants to to try it

788
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,179
um

789
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,080
don't know what it is you can find out

790
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,640
um but if anyone wants to speak with us

791
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
we're going to be down here for a few

792
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,980
minutes thank you
