1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,020
hey folks

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,360
so hopefully you're here for my talk uh

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,460
if you're not here for my talk you're

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,559
welcome to leave uh today I'm going to

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,900
talk about if you've not seen me speak

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,300
before a couple of things I go off on

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,980
tangents quite a lot

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,980
um I swear down again and hopefully you

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,240
enjoy the top that's not really a

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,320
warning that's just kind of like if

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,880
you've got questions save them for the

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,099
end um I've had interactive thoughts in

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,460
the past but because yeah

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,739
um so yeah this is me uh Amanda Gill I'm

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,540
also known as a professional internet on

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,620
most things

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,800
um I am the UK and EU support me around

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,500
EU UK adversarial engineering at Lara's

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,940
Consulting so what that means is I do

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,980
red healing and they allocate thanks to

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,719
other people that's great

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,219
um I've been slightly defensive but

23
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,020
mostly offensive for over a decade so

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,320
that is applicable to both security and

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,000
vernacular it's not the right words but

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,640
what's it hard uh I've written two books

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,039
uh so the first one is on how to get

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,480
into pen testing and the second one is

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
on hope you have pen testing and going

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
to others I'm also a contributor to

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
various open source software projects uh

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,460
the most recent I've watched is

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,820
Grandmaster which is used for a mass uh

34
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,280
brute forcing against endpoints so if

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
you've got credentials or you've lost

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
their credentials you want to get into

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,560
like Azure or OCTA or other services

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,740
like Grandmaster is the tool for it

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,060
so what I'm going to be talking about

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,159
today uh this is less of a technical

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,780
talk and more of a if you're wanting to

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,100
get into pen testing or if you've done

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,020
testing pen testing for a while or maybe

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,820
you don't understand pen testing it's

45
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,799
not going to be any of that and it's

46
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,840
going to talk about kind of the mistakes

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,340
we make to spend test those why the

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
business hates pen testers or techies in

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
general like it's not exclusive to pen

50
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,320
test or generally speaking Business

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,619
technical so don't tap the chair please

52
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,479
and that's whoever the just

53
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,680
happened at the back

54
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,920
um yeah so it's relevant to anyone

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,119
working as a consultant with an

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
organization who is in a technical role

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,020
so as a consultant in hand testing you

58
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,140
speak both geek and suit and it's really

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,759
important to be able to do and I'm going

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,020
to be talking about risk understanding I

61
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,220
know you talk about the common mistakes

62
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm going to talk about why the business

63
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,700
should actually care about findings um

64
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,620
and how to translate them into tangible

65
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
value and showing value as a consultant

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,260
so delivering your your deliverable uh

67
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,239
giving your or giving like talks giving

68
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,000
debriefs or what's not calling the

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,959
always a good one to start with

70
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,140
and then transforming them I didn't

71
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,520
finish that it's like transforming them

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,140
into actual findings so that's what I

73
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,879
meant to say real professional here

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,959
folks

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,440
so understanding and conveying risk

76
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,379
there are multiple components that go

77
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,420
into risk and when you're getting into

78
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,220
pen testing or you want to get into

79
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,660
Consulting one of the things that people

80
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,640
don't really tell you is realistically

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,959
speaking you're getting paid to write

82
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,959
reports the hacking is free and if you

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,580
get that into your mind then you you go

84
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,840
right okay I want to build a cool hacks

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,879
I want to like get four days or like a

86
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,860
remarkable execution that's cool and all

87
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,900
but being able to convey that to our

88
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,519
clients really important and

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,019
understanding the context in which

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,459
you're convenient to the client is even

91
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,840
more important

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,159
um someone in this room who's sitting in

93
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,959
the front row about to fall asleep uh

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,540
told me a really wise once a while ago

95
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,400
with every finding you raise the client

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
creates work for someone so being able

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,180
to contextualize what you're raising to

98
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,980
someone is really important and what I

99
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,599
mean by that is if you have something

100
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,180
that is say a friendly so you put SEO

101
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,379
injections you've got an application

102
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,599
that's vulnerable where you can inject

103
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,519
um malicious queries and get data back

104
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,459
that depending on the context might not

105
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,019
be a critical risk if it's on the

106
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,819
internet unauthenticated and you're

107
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,080
getting personal identifiable

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,760
information yes it's probably a critical

109
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,620
however if it's on an internal

110
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,060
application where there are multiple

111
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
Technical and procedural controls in

112
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,900
place that are restricting access maybe

113
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,640
you're on a virtual desktop environment

114
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,319
you've got multiplied authentication in

115
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,760
place you might have

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,220
um input validation to an extent then

117
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,840
that goes from being critical to a very

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
medium risk of even a low depending if

119
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,738
there are compensating controls equally

120
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,819
um where you're thinking right okay I've

121
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,860
got this really cool attack chain uh

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,120
I've exploited like active director

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
certificate services and the effects for

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,899
it inside the environment might be

125
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,358
rebuild your environment so where you

126
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,220
might raise it as a as a high the actual

127
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,680
fix is more detrimental and more

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
difficult so that releases the risk and

129
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
hopefully raises the priority to the

130
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,419
organization and one thing I'll talk

131
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,340
about later on is prioritizing what

132
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,100
you're reporting to clients because one

133
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,560
of the bigger the first tangent one of

134
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,300
the bigger things is client requirements

135
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,259
so

136
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,880
um if a client has a requirement for you

137
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,500
to come into a pen test or do an instant

138
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,960
response or act as a Solutions architect

139
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
or a secret architect sticking to your

140
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,919
scope and sticking to your understanding

141
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,440
of the environment is important and you

142
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,820
might not have the whole picture so this

143
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,800
is why context is really important you

144
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,440
might be in a very time box so anyone

145
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
who's done pen testing or is looking to

146
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,440
get into pen testing they're typically

147
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
time boxed engagement so you might be

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
given five ten days to look at an

149
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,040
application look at an environment try

150
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,520
and into something and in those days so

151
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,259
five days ten days you need to do the

152
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,060
hacking write the report and keep the

153
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,320
client up to date with what's going on

154
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,360
so you might not have enough time to

155
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,979
understand what you're looking at you

156
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,139
might be inside a really enormous

157
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,720
Windows Active Directory environment and

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,100
you've got context that are in specific

159
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,900
groups you can see oh we've got there's

160
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,699
a lost prevention group here is that

161
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,320
loss prevention because of data loss

162
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
prevention so like DLP so your

163
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,460
exploitation or is that Financial loss

164
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,080
like what what's the naming and the main

165
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,180
culture around the groups so having

166
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,100
context is really important and this is

167
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,900
where communication comes in something

168
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,820
we as Geeks are pretty bad at is

169
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,720
communication and

170
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,580
is if you get into your head that

171
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,740
Consulting is about reporting and

172
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,720
speaking because the clients you will

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,940
become better not overnight you become

174
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,160
better speaking to clients if you

175
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
struggle with speaking to people hand

176
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,759
wrestling and Consulting probably isn't

177
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,979
for you the hacking is great you can go

178
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,419
and do research and stuff but if you can

179
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,759
convenience you are a zero use to the

180
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,160
organization because your role as a pen

181
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
tester

182
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm using pandas as a prime example

183
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,660
because it's what my background is in

184
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,699
your role as a pen tester is to

185
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,620
highlight risks and findings to an

186
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,600
organization that are going to help them

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,660
secure their their model and it might be

188
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,580
that you're raising things that are not

189
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,020
necessarily technical findings they

190
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,639
might be procedural false so one of the

191
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,440
things I find quite commonly in things

192
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
like Insider threat engagements or in

193
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
certain threat assessments where you

194
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
start as an employee or maybe you've got

195
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,160
credentials and you can see that access

196
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,979
into the environment and you you need to

197
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,020
emulate a malicious employee so you've

198
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,360
got Insider threats insert threats split

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,220
into two here we are tangent but it's

200
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,780
not even taking a two waves you've got

201
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,979
maliciousness here and you've got

202
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,139
accidental Insider accidental Insider

203
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,479
tends to be uh see an employee

204
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,520
accidentally deletes drops production

205
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,800
database it happens people do it that's

206
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,240
an accidental incident that's still an

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,800
insulated threat because it's a risk in

208
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
in terms of the business but I'm

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,380
malicious inside there is someone who

210
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,720
goes down purposely to go and Achieve

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,560
access and objectives

212
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
so you're finding it might be a

213
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,900
procedural finding so the procedure

214
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,039
finding that I come across quite

215
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,780
frequently is who are data governance

216
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,460
management and what that actually means

217
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,919
is that if you're crawling file shares

218
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,940
so you're running something like Snap

219
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,360
war or um HUD shares so there are two

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,660
tools that are used for indexing SMB

221
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,280
shares so and five shares within the

222
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
windows environment you have Soundbar as

223
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,340
well and then in search of them using

224
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,340
regular expressions and various other

225
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,620
um strings to catch things so you're

226
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,720
looking for things like ease and maybe

227
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,900
insecure permissions in itself that's a

228
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,699
technical finding but the feeling there

229
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,500
is pure data governance so the feeling

230
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,539
in that is that the organization people

231
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,919
with an organization have at least set

232
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,780
up the professions wrong or they may be

233
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,520
putting things in a central file share

234
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,500
that shouldn't essentially match one key

235
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,479
example I've seen in a lot of pen tests

236
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,340
recently is if you're using um I'm not

237
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,479
sure if it's defaults it's not really

238
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,099
the condition on it but if you're using

239
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,240
the Azure

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
um ad password blacklisting or deny

241
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,419
listing

242
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,000
um feature the centralized block list of

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,340
passwords is stored on the sys file and

244
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,380
anyone can read that now that's not

245
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,880
necessarily a sense of information but

246
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,139
if you get access into the environment

247
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,240
as uh Melissa Insider and you want to

248
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,819
Brute Force passwords having the list of

249
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,259
things that shouldn't be allowed is a

250
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,160
really good starting point because

251
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
you're like right okay I'm going to try

252
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,460
some of these and there might be Legacy

253
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,440
accounts that have these passwords but

254
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,700
the odds are there's not gonna be very

255
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,559
many so taking them out of your string

256
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,700
less than saying like things like

257
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,020
Seasons things like months of the year

258
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
and company name are quite common

259
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,059
um local local cities and stuff I mean

260
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,099
by default I think Microsoft has like

261
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,600
the top 100 passwords that are there so

262
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,980
you've got like password welcome one

263
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,360
that kind of stuff

264
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,580
um but taking that mindset and applying

265
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,740
it to looking at things a more broader

266
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,899
scale will allow you to deliver better

267
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,980
value

268
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,740
so the kind of common mistakes that NS

269
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,440
has made and I what was not about

270
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,779
aileron is raising a finding or raising

271
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,300
a specific issue and Report creates work

272
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,180
for someone and that is true so anyone

273
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,500
who's ever received the paying attention

274
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,240
report or anyone who's ever looked at

275
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
any response report and seen all the

276
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,640
alerts that you have things like

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,019
electricity where you've got thousands

278
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,339
of alerts and you're like okay well I

279
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,360
don't really know what to do with this

280
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,920
or we want to deal with this it's the

281
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,779
same with pen test reports some pain

282
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,459
testers will be like right okay well

283
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,920
I've got a really dry report maybe not

284
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,140
got any findings let me just collect all

285
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,940
of the vulnerable HTTP headers and have

286
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,580
one finding per header which I mean the

287
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,080
root cause of that is fetch your headers

288
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,839
so one recommendation if there is a

289
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,760
recommendation that fixes multiple

290
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,100
problems have one finding for it the

291
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,899
caveat for that is if there are

292
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,399
different areas within an environment

293
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,959
that it may be applicable to for example

294
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,660
if you're testing um the dev environment

295
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,920
the QA environment and will be the

296
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,240
production of Ireland or the uat

297
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,920
environment it might be that you're

298
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
speaking to different teams so the

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
client May request that you have three

300
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,800
of

301
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,680
different teams so that's an

302
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,940
understanding you need to have going

303
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,220
into it the other thing is taking

304
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,360
vulnerability assessment findings um so

305
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
I've talked about this in the past but

306
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,180
I'm vulnerable assessment and a pen test

307
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,560
are two totally different things and so

308
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,940
was a red team sort of property and they

309
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,680
are not the same thing organizations

310
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
within the UK and the states and around

311
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,019
the world will take the the same naming

312
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,000
scheme in a bike right okay with Soldier

313
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,040
red team but we're going to send you a

314
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,240
junior on site they don't say that we're

315
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,140
just going to send someone on site

316
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,220
they're going to run nessus and they're

317
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,260
gonna off it's not already that

318
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,640
that's a vulnerable assessment in my

319
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
eyes and equally since I've joined the

320
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,019
company I work for now my understanding

321
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,820
of what pen test looks like versus what

322
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,920
appended so I understand what appendix

323
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
looks like in an open scope engagement

324
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,779
versus a very time boss is totally

325
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,060
different typically working for like

326
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,279
I've worked for four or five UK

327
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,480
consultancies

328
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,060
and a lot of them are good internal pain

329
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,519
tests Rock up run this is jobs are good

330
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,019
friends friends with families export

331
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,339
them or maybe don't exploit them just

332
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,260
just find them whereas the company I

333
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,420
currently work for you don't believe in

334
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,980
this I mean you've got it they'll be

335
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,899
known again but you're looking at

336
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,360
um kind of root cause analysis high risk

337
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
findings High impactful findings things

338
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,620
like

339
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,600
really complicated attack paths whereby

340
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,399
you're maybe compromising a path to the

341
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,899
domain Advent and you're maybe looking

342
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,760
at getting I don't know vulnerable

343
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,440
specific services and you're getting a

344
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,880
ballistic certificate and you're

345
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,140
impersonating domain I've been and

346
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,160
you've got to be happening so that's

347
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,839
that's not even the the main objective

348
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,579
that's like stage zero and then your

349
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,380
actual actions and objectives in the pen

350
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,060
test are well I want to go after

351
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,740
financial data I want to go after

352
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,240
intellectual property or I want to go

353
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,459
after these specific documents once you

354
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,140
get the main admin that's when you can

355
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,339
go after those specific things because

356
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,899
you can impersonate users you can go

357
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,459
after a specific things you can access

358
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,980
either the network if if the test is

359
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,420
looking at Network segregation you're

360
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,640
looking at well actually as a standard

361
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,260
user I can't browse to this part of the

362
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,579
network however because they've got

363
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,019
administrative privileges I can add

364
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,700
myself to the groups that lets me to see

365
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,620
that part of the network or it might be

366
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,360
that I've seen in environments whereby

367
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,980
once you get the main Advent happens

368
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,720
I've got lunch across the environment so

369
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,980
you might have active directory

370
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,779
restrictions in inside the environment

371
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,160
you might have access control

372
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,839
restrictions instead like your Linux

373
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,920
environment or whether you're like a

374
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,420
specific Enclave once you have

375
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,300
green things too high or not enough

376
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,959
context to give an ample restricting so

377
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,220
um I'll talk about vulnerability

378
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,920
findings later on but things like

379
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,779
if you have

380
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,420
um I don't know smme public strengths so

381
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,480
if SNMP is a protocol for identifying

382
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
information or getting information

383
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,540
mostly off of network devices but you

384
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,380
can have

385
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,120
um other systems so you can have service

386
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
or an SNP

387
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
typically a lot of pen testers will

388
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,459
raise that as a high risk now if you

389
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,839
actually go and exploit that and you

390
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,279
look at the information that SNMP is

391
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,720
giving you back from a public Community

392
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,300
string it might be as simple as here is

393
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,459
the host name of the box that is an

394
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,260
informational finding at best but

395
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,120
without doing the exploitation phase or

396
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,620
without diving a little bit deeper you

397
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,000
don't have the context therefore you're

398
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
going to rate high risk and the client

399
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,060
might be like well actually we're going

400
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,160
to put that down as an accepted risk and

401
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,120
that's the other thing you need to

402
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,380
understand is

403
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,560
as a consultant you raise findings to

404
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,000
the client collect compaction but

405
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,079
actually

406
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,399
we've got

407
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,800
50 findings that's pen is this massive

408
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,240
environment there's lots of things wrong

409
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,100
with the environment but we're going to

410
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,620
accept all the risks and that is going

411
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,620
to the client specific context what they

412
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,880
may come back to you though and say is

413
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,500
well you've raised this as a critical

414
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
risk we've got these compensating

415
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
controls in place blah blah blah blah

416
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
can you drop the rest rate in the report

417
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,420
and for the most part I would disagree

418
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,920
with that because you're reporting on

419
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,480
what you can see you're reporting on

420
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,500
what you've seen that period of time

421
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,180
there are specific contexts where you

422
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,339
might be in an environment where you're

423
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,019
like well actually okay well I've seen

424
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,220
you've got multi-factor authentication

425
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,420
in place but it's not for the specific

426
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,940
user so it's an outline case an outlying

427
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,120
problem

428
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,860
it's not uh a systemic problem it's a

429
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,660
it's an edge case problem so whereby

430
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,600
lack of MFA might be a high risk in

431
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,639
actual fact because it's one User it's

432
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,260
like well this is actually a gap in

433
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,000
process so therefore the default might

434
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,980
not be lack of MFA the fault might be um

435
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,139
not mature enough or the process needs

436
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,000
to be reviewed so that's taking the

437
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
technical finding and killing off the um

438
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,120
governance or the

439
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,360
GRT system

440
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,019
um the procedural fault are then

441
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,760
applying as a friendly the other thing

442
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,079
to understand is that you know

443
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,480
understand the lack of understanding so

444
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,980
I talk about context and talk about

445
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,320
environment quite a lot you need to

446
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
understand this consultant and also if

447
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
you're if you're a um receive If you're

448
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,360
receiving pen testing you also need to

449
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,459
understand this too as a consultant you

450
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,500
don't have the full picture you know

451
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,699
most of the time you have a full picture

452
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,199
so you don't understand the internal

453
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,639
Politics the internet bureaucracy the

454
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,899
teams that these reports are going to

455
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,180
the the things that they affect what

456
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,920
stage of play they are how long they do

457
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
the environment does the client even

458
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,920
know about them so that lack of

459
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,019
understanding is one thing the other

460
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,519
lack of understanding is the lack of

461
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,760
technical understanding so looking at a

462
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,519
specific exploits and specific things so

463
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,680
one of the most common exploits that you

464
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,060
probably get taught in University when

465
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,880
it comes to the windows exploitation is

466
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,639
lso8067 net API which is uh smpe

467
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,579
vulnerability from 2007 2008 which is an

468
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,320
unauthenticated remote code execution is

469
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,139
unability however under the hood what in

470
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,579
the export investment is pretty stable

471
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,899
but there are other ones that will cause

472
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,120
a buffer overflow now for those that

473
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,980
don't maybe know about Buffalo Force

474
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,300
they can cause the machine to crash

475
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,339
sometimes and running these kind of

476
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,380
exports and production servers have an

477
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,459
impact as well so if you don't

478
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,019
understand what that's doing you are

479
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,240
introducing unnecessary risk in an

480
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,360
environment as a pen tester you want to

481
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,639
go into the environment find what you

482
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,260
need to find and clean up after yourself

483
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,519
because

484
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,920
the amount of times I have cured reports

485
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,440
I've spoken to clients I've seen

486
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,480
leftovers from previous pen tests it's

487
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,519
ridiculous you you go into the

488
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,620
environment and you you make it or you

489
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,060
you bring tools in the environment and

490
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,800
you leave them behind like yes exactly

491
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,260
yes is a legitimate administrative tool

492
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,740
for remote execution on systems it uses

493
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,720
SMD you can use it as admin because it's

494
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,519
not usually use a system the amount of

495
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,980
times I've seen that the PS exact SVC

496
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,139
service running on boxes from a random

497
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,060
host that's just been sitting there that

498
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,920
is potentially exploitable and you can

499
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,260
use that for execution which is making

500
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,880
the environment less secure than it was

501
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
when you given and the objective is to

502
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
make it more secure so by making it less

503
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,639
secure you're you're not you're doing

504
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,560
them at the service the bottom one there

505
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
is in Christ the amount of

506
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
times have been on calls with other pen

507
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,839
testers so not in my current phone but

508
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,660
other other companies and you're you're

509
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,279
on the call and you're like right the

510
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,019
client might be getting an external pen

511
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,579
test an internal pen test an application

512
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,440
security assessment and there are

513
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
definitely Consultants doing each aspect

514
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,860
and you have an understanding of

515
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,660
different aspects and these people like

516
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,519
your colleagues but they are chatting

517
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,740
absolute travel to the client like oh

518
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,540
yeah

519
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,560
that's completely wrong but because

520
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
you're you're in

521
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,740
colleagues you don't want to call them

522
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,119
out in front of from the FED all right

523
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,500
so

524
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,540
and also the client might call you about

525
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,099
it and that's total nonsense what you're

526
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,359
talking about like have been on calls

527
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,059
with vendors before whereby it's been

528
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,459
myself so my colleagues and other pen

529
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,559
test firms and I it's very

530
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,000
unprofessional but I've called it other

531
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,559
pen test forms for saying you're wrong

532
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,020
there was a there's like um a client

533
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,040
called

534
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
a couple of years ago actually so it

535
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,980
wasn't it wasn't a Liars it was a

536
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,160
previous company and the the client had

537
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,380
another pen test if I'm on the call and

538
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,299
they were talking about how

539
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,100
um Kerberos thing worked they're talking

540
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,299
about how you're progress the lesson I

541
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,080
was like I'm just going to stop you

542
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
there what you've said there is

543
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,679
completely Incorrect and not applicable

544
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
to what you're showing on screen and

545
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,799
they just went right we'll just skip to

546
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,299
the next finding and I'm like that's

547
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,860
just the lack of understanding and it

548
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,780
also falls into in class so try

549
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,860
and be honest if you don't know

550
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,380
something just say you don't know and

551
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,940
if you're trying to be professional on a

552
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,440
call with a client

553
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,260
try and mask your language in a way that

554
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,419
you're social client into talking about

555
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,260
different things if you're not

556
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,700
comfortable saying I don't know it's

557
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,260
also important to have humility in this

558
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,539
game too being able to make me don't

559
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,280
know and and say well I don't know about

560
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,780
this but I'll go and researcher or I'll

561
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,760
find you the answer I say that all the

562
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,260
time because nobody knows everything

563
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,299
there are specific topics I don't know a

564
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,260
lot about things like

565
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,740
certificate services so adcs for sure

566
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,120
easier to say

567
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,740
it's a vulnerability that allows you to

568
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,140
there's nine different certificate uh

569
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,179
vulnerabilities there's ESC one through

570
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,340
nine and they have different properties

571
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,380
that you can exploit to impersonate

572
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,720
users or gain the Kerber ticket for

573
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,299
specific user and one of the things I

574
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,220
didn't understand like how do we fix

575
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,200
this and from everything I was reading I

576
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,820
was like well actually you can't fix it

577
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,740
you need to re-implement everything and

578
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,120
it later transpired from reading more

579
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,100
that there's actually specific not for

580
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,419
all of the nine of them but there's this

581
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,000
in like ESC two and three and four there

582
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,980
are specific flash you can label

583
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,840
in existing configurations that will

584
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,460
help method it doesn't affects the

585
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,440
problem but it adds an additional way of

586
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,179
navigation so very additional research

587
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,100
really important

588
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,200
so why should the business care reasons

589
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,059
to the pen testing why should you depend

590
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,440
testing a product and how do you improve

591
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
your process

592
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,039
well pen testing

593
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,280
I as a pen tester I don't think most

594
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,720
companies need pen testing and that

595
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,039
sounds really ironic because I've been

596
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,780
doing pen testing for a while but I

597
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,340
don't think pen testing delivers a lot

598
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,100
of value most of the time a lot of the

599
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,080
time clients don't need pen testing they

600
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,340
probably need a more mature security

601
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,840
program where they're looking at things

602
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,360
like an asset list and vulnerability

603
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,700
management patch management those are a

604
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,260
few things that if you have those three

605
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,580
things now that you can at least start

606
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,740
looking at pen testing equally having a

607
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,299
secure development process the amount of

608
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,740
things that you look at applications

609
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,080
like applications mobile apps Cloud apps

610
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,780
and even like cicd pipelines there are

611
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,000
things that there is no security thought

612
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,440
that has gone into that entire process

613
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,580
I've seen it so many times that it's

614
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,860
it's just it's hilarious to see but it

615
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,960
just happens and

616
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,460
so the reasons that you should do pen

617
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,799
testing so that there are maybe three or

618
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,179
four three or four ones off the top of

619
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,860
the head things are like compliance so

620
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,299
if you're going through like sock two

621
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,100
which is a framework for finance and

622
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,059
dealing things you've got things like

623
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,760
PCI DSS and you've got check which is

624
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,740
the UK government organization for well

625
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,600
Government testing check

626
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
you've got other forms of compliance

627
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
those are compliance-based pen tests

628
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,840
those are we need a check in the box to

629
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,100
see that we've had this application pen

630
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,600
tested before it goes out to The Wider

631
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,360
Market or we've had this app this um

632
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,400
part of the environment pen tested to to

633
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,260
a degree that we can deal with data

634
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,940
that's not the secret or top secret or

635
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,340
and data marketing there are things the

636
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,660
other reason to do pen testing is if

637
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,860
you've got the three things that talks

638
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,140
about doing which you want to imagine

639
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,940
and an asset list

640
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,100
taking that and maturing your security

641
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,900
model is really important too

642
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,480
so looking at things like well we've got

643
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,280
we've got our cicd pipeline so a

644
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,600
continuous integration case development

645
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
pipeline so we're building apps on the

646
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,780
regular how do we secure those apps and

647
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,160
how do we make sure they're secure well

648
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,320
looking at first of all the code so

649
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,640
reviewing the code on the application

650
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,260
setting the role reviewing the process

651
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,020
so that the cicd highways particular and

652
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,340
thought about looking at the pipeline

653
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,440
itself so other vulnerabilities in India

654
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,760
and the infrastructure I mean the

655
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,660
chances are it's probably going to be

656
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,860
enclosed so it's probably going to be

657
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,260
servos and the if you find products

658
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,980
you're going to report into this

659
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,720
representative

660
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,100
so the respective Cloud providers so AWS

661
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,400
Azure gcp Alibaba Oracle electric poison

662
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,799
they're all kind of the same the top 50

663
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,220
and gcp and yes and sure and if you find

664
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,419
a bug in the infrastructure there the

665
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,799
odds are it's not going to just affect

666
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,820
the client application it's going to

667
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,580
affect like the entire platform so it's

668
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,320
it's likely just going to be a little

669
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,620
bit more secure not always but some days

670
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,960
so yeah compliance you've got mature in

671
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,520
your organization you've got you might

672
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,380
just want to have an idea of what your

673
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,720
um organization looks like so a lot of

674
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
the time uh clients will get or

675
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,020
organizations will get a pen test

676
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,120
carried out to maybe build an asset

677
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,919
register I wouldn't really call that pen

678
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,860
testing like maybe pin sweep or or Port

679
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,419
scale environment to identify what

680
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,159
you've got within your environment

681
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,960
equally you might have something more

682
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,059
specialist so maybe you run industrial

683
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,100
Control Systems um or but you have

684
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,539
credit connection infrastructure and you

685
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,059
don't know you know what ICS systems

686
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,200
you've got so you maybe have water

687
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
filtration you maybe got like reduction

688
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,100
lines but you don't know what it

689
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,600
equipment is in the operational

690
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,400
technology environment so the OT so the

691
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
ipot bridge and performing a pen test

692
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,620
within an ICS environment you need to be

693
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
really careful because you don't want to

694
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,860
take things offline in fact I have taken

695
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,720
a production later before and it cost

696
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,820
the company millions of dollars not not

697
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,620
a good work but equally the client is

698
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,480
quite cool about it so you see these in

699
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
the things

700
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,020
but why I say that is you you pen test

701
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,760
the ICS equipment you find out that it's

702
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,679
it's secure whatever but then there are

703
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,020
other machines inside the factory that

704
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,580
are maybe not so secure so maybe you've

705
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,260
got uh I don't know maybe you've got a

706
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,120
desktop that is Bridging the OT Network

707
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,159
to the ID Network I've seen it in the

708
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,200
past where you've got maybe an engineer

709
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
brings a laptop in because they want to

710
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,260
watch Netflix while they're working and

711
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,640
they plug it in and it's got TeamViewer

712
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,659
running on it so they can remote into

713
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,760
the host and that team viewers out of

714
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,960
date so you can exploit it and get cool

715
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,400
execution and because it's good

716
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,960
connection from the corporate Network to

717
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
the OT Network you're going from

718
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
corporate Network straight into

719
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,780
production and as an attacker as a boss

720
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,679
is attacking you might want to

721
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,500
ransomware of the entire ICS environment

722
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,020
as a pen tester probably not so much I

723
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,179
have done ransomware assessments before

724
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,740
where we've written custom runs

725
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,419
somewhere to encrypt the environment to

726
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,600
show what the impact would be and but I

727
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,539
I don't give people free backup testing

728
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,820
because as we're just test your backups

729
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,600
work

730
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
so the other reason you might do pain

731
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
testing is to improve processes so I

732
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
talked about securing paper it's not

733
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,020
about securing app is securing

734
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,059
infrastructure and if you've got certain

735
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,980
things internally that are like

736
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,539
procedural and governance faults doing

737
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,039
pen testing might identify those things

738
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,159
so what where you have a good example

739
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,140
this is password policies if you've got

740
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,059
a password policy documented that says

741
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,159
we need to have 12 characters three

742
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,120
three

743
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,360
um three attempts maximum lockout and um

744
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,620
I don't know that there's also facing

745
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,480
Windows 10 in 30 minutes so every every

746
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,039
30 minutes you can try three before you

747
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,200
lock their code that's all documented

748
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,240
it's in Theory been implemented by Group

749
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,799
Policy but then you go to test it it's

750
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,480
like actually I can do 20 before I lock

751
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,620
against it and there's no automation

752
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,200
window so proving that controls what are

753
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,460
disproving the controls right so

754
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,900
creating hypothesis is improving and

755
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,460
disapproving it it's another reason why

756
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,440
I should depends

757
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,240
reasons to hate right

758
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
so I talked about earlier on about hand

759
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,140
testers

760
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,380
um Consultants making environments more

761
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,640
insecure than they were when they first

762
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,700
came in and one of the main reasons that

763
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,440
I find people hate pen testers is

764
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
because they've had a bad experience and

765
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,620
they found that someone's taking off the

766
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,659
production system one of my good

767
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,159
colleagues told me a story recently

768
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,440
about how when he worked in a previous

769
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,659
company uh one of the database Engineers

770
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,460
refused to get any pen testing done

771
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,620
because one time he had a production

772
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,020
database that uh running on Solaris

773
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,780
seven or eight so it's really old

774
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,520
um that was taken down by some Junior

775
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,260
pen tests and who brought a SQL query

776
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,640
that dropped the tables and because he

777
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
didn't have any backups he just made a

778
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
look fill but also it took a production

779
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,980
database off so he was like right that's

780
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,220
it

781
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,059
the organization had to de-scope that

782
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,299
from pen test and the organization as a

783
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,679
result like well we've discussed this in

784
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,240
the pen test maybe the exact don't have

785
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,559
the context around this they're like we

786
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,120
hit the pen test as a result and you

787
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,860
don't have the context another thing

788
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,600
anyone who's ever been on site for a

789
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,120
client anytime anything breaks on site

790
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,320
doesn't matter what it is the light

791
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,500
switches are going off for I don't know

792
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,000
it must be in the network absolutely

793
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,039
fantastic it's not that people don't

794
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,120
believe us

795
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,500
he wouldn't like it when few things

796
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,860
break either so making something

797
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,940
intentionally unsecure maybe not

798
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,260
understanding that making it insecure

799
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,179
they might not hate you the time that

800
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,200
you're doing the pen test but you might

801
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,940
come later down the line and maybe it's

802
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,580
not maybe it's a compliance based

803
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,080
engagement

804
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,419
um you you come in you give your report

805
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,740
and go right okay there's probably 10

806
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,480
high risks whatever and you leave stuff

807
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,039
line about the Auditors come in you look

808
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,299
at the report to go right okay and they

809
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,320
look at the environment they go well

810
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,360
actually you've not fixed this so this

811
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,799
is no vulnerable to this because pen

812
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,840
test Alex has done why so having the

813
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,640
understanding that you are potentially

814
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,900
breaking things about is really

815
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,720
important too and like I said everything

816
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,520
is broken lack of cleanup and care of

817
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,380
environments can a self-explanatory

818
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,840
taught that to death

819
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,360
so maximizing your return

820
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,360
so this is where being a consultant

821
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,980
first and being a hacker second is

822
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,840
really important so taking your

823
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,900
understanding from

824
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,400
I am looking at your environment I'm

825
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
going to work with you and I'm going to

826
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,940
understand what your business does the

827
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,760
the so security for the most part is a

828
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,039
loss it's an organization in the sense

829
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,659
there is a financial burden it's a black

830
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,940
hole like until the return on investment

831
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,279
comes from security people don't see so

832
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,559
what is security well we didn't get

833
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,419
hacked so we saved X millions of dollars

834
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,100
but the business doesn't care about that

835
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,419
necessary pain test and it's like oh

836
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,400
we've got we've got invoice for 100

837
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,559
grand for pen test and why the they

838
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,779
want to pay that like what what benefit

839
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:10,860
does that does that give the

840
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,240
organization so working with the

841
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
customer to allow them to or to enable

842
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,900
them to better understand their

843
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,100
environment and better understand the

844
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,779
value so taking what I've said hopefully

845
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,760
in the last 20 minutes or 30 minutes and

846
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,559
taking that and applying it to when

847
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,179
you're speaking to customers equally

848
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,340
taking their understanding of their own

849
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,200
environment and maybe giving it a

850
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,059
different light because as a pen tester

851
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,500
you speak lots of different people you

852
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,700
speak Executives you speak the

853
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,320
developers you speak to people who are

854
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,820
being not technical at all so people

855
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,400
Marketing sales and you've got those

856
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,740
that are my business admins

857
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,840
uh points in which I've done engagements

858
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,520
I've learned more about a client's

859
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,960
environment than they know about their

860
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,760
environment so you might uncover things

861
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,020
that they don't know about you might

862
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,400
uncover

863
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,500
um I don't know maybe maybe bill in

864
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,360
finances brought a rashify in because he

865
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,520
wants to set in Minecraft or he wants to

866
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,380
set and download Power and he wants to

867
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,880
do whatever and he's got another way of

868
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,220
doing it by being on the network and

869
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,900
finding that maybe not knowing so much

870
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,580
but finding the Raspberry Pi and they're

871
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,380
like right that's a bit weird you've got

872
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,120
a you've got a massive Windows estate

873
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,620
that you could note that Xbox is about

874
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,120
this random machine that's got the

875
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,799
default password of raspberry is super

876
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,600
high raspberry boom I'm on I want a

877
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,439
roughly access

878
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,240
they're like we don't have any raspberry

879
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Piers we're talking about and it turns

880
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,120
out it's probably an understudy desk so

881
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,360
you find out you do like a not flashy or

882
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,159
you whack out what the idea looks like

883
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,140
it's got an IP address and if something

884
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,059
else is going on and it's you can

885
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,820
identify things equally in application

886
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,460
security testing you might look at it a

887
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,080
totally different way or most of the

888
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,179
time we do is as testers we look at

889
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,260
applications in a totally different

890
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,000
manner to the way than which the day of

891
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,559
intended and that's why pen testing can

892
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,500
be really valuable because things like

893
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,640
um privilege escalation within

894
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,020
applications you might have an

895
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,159
application that you start off as a

896
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,799
standard user you find out through some

897
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,179
means that there may be a lack of

898
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,980
validation uh Dave and I were shot at

899
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,779
this on the car on the way up yesterday

900
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,520
there would be a lack of validation in

901
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,840
terms of headers so you might have

902
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,820
client-side controls on your application

903
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,700
that restrict what you can do

904
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,919
client-side so maybe maybe the password

905
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,020
policy is you've got maybe 10 characters

906
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,240
apart that your client states but if you

907
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,340
send that in a pop request and send that

908
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
a proxy and you you forward that on you

909
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,120
might have a password of no characters

910
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,919
or one character or whatever and that is

911
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,600
supplemented a classic control because

912
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,980
the dealer hasn't thought about that and

913
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,059
that's why this is really important

914
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,760
equally speaking privilege questions so

915
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,640
a lot of applications nowadays are built

916
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,000
on Frameworks and by default for a lot

917
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,279
of them they are more secure than they

918
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,539
would have been 10 years ago because

919
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,179
their security control Supply now to get

920
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,039
something to work right we just snack

921
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,539
over a full post as a developer and see

922
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:46,799
what's they need to turn this setting

923
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,080
off because I need to get the CSS

924
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,460
working I need to get this specific

925
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,960
thing working and what you've done

926
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,460
unintentionally is turned off a security

927
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,340
control which has major application more

928
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,659
insecure so as a consultant you're

929
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:58,740
coming in you're looking at you're like

930
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,320
actually this application is vulnerable

931
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
to a cross-hatching unless the

932
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,260
application is vulnerable to SQL

933
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,059
ingestion and you've read the

934
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,260
documentation like it shouldn't be

935
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,700
available to this because you've got all

936
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,200
these controls enabled but it finds that

937
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,539
you've turned off user input validation

938
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,720
for example so understanding that and

939
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,039
being able to apply it and telling the

940
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,779
client about their application and he

941
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,580
puts in the client about things that you

942
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,840
might find that are really not security

943
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,340
for anything not maybe not governance

944
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,140
findings maybe they're just QE findings

945
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,000
the right things I've done pain tests in

946
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,679
the past whereby you do an application

947
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,919
security test you do a cloud test the

948
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,419
fact that the application hasn't

949
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,919
actually been through a QA so you find

950
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,059
things that are broken the app that

951
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,320
aren't security faults they're just like

952
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,940
I click this button nothing happens and

953
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,200
that might be a I think the reason

954
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
behind as well so that's providing extra

955
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,419
value and extra understanding

956
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,419
you also build up experience uh to teach

957
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,100
charging situations and explain things

958
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,039
so the more time you do Consulting the

959
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,600
better understanding you have of what

960
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,460
what's the different Technologies one of

961
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,659
the things I learned quite quickly

962
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,580
quickly when I started the pen testing

963
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,500
was you were thrown into probably a

964
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,059
different environment every single week

965
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,919
or every other week and you may know

966
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,779
nothing about it so when I first started

967
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:11,520
in pen testing I was about 2014 2012

968
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,279
2013 2014 and was working for for a

969
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,260
large security event at the time and it

970
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,520
was a first day like here's a laptop

971
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,960
it's still an Essence jobs are good and

972
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,860
go and go and do whatever

973
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:25,980
and I was like I know what those words

974
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,539
mean but not what the order is so

975
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,220
learning on your feet and reading

976
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,480
documentation is really important as

977
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,020
well and building up experience so

978
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,580
this is important for learning pen

979
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,779
testing this is important for getting

980
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:37,919
higher this is important for just

981
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,419
building up a general understanding of

982
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,620
the industry

983
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,120
um one of the things that I found over

984
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,039
the years of interviewing people

985
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,659
speaking to people doing doing things

986
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,220
with classes side part is really

987
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,960
important I'm not saying you need to go

988
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,520
and do side projects but if you have

989
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,200
like a home lab or something or you have

990
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,460
an interesting cloud or you have an

991
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,960
interest in

992
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,640
um game sheets that game sheets is quite

993
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,559
a good one from lava development doing

994
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,640
that kind of stuff in your free time

995
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,460
builds up an arbitrary or a different

996
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,380
understanding of a different topic

997
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,820
that's not relevant to your your main

998
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,039
job but you might be on a call with a

999
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,500
client and you might be like a good

1000
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,419
example of this is I run unify so you

1001
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,039
better think equipment at home and I was

1002
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,480
on site working for a council a couple

1003
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,340
years ago doing doing government work on

1004
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,760
check work so and comprise they were

1005
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,200
having problems with their access points

1006
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,460
they're like oh these are not adult

1007
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,960
thing or whatever it's like I'm just

1008
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,220
going to put security like I said like

1009
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,480
I've seen this problem before because

1010
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,940
ubiquitous when was wrong like it's

1011
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,200
fine when it's when it's when it's

1012
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,820
working but when it's not working

1013
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,380
stuff as well as I hear all the things

1014
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,640
you can look at here things you can fix

1015
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,500
this is not my professional advice this

1016
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,059
is just personal

1017
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,340
so that was that was a a situation I

1018
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,700
think also on the same topic

1019
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,919
um I watched an engagement already last

1020
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,320
year I think and it right about the time

1021
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,240
maybe it wasn't last it was when log 4G

1022
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,340
came out so log 4G vulnerability that

1023
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,320
affects the Java Library

1024
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
um the English is getting remote

1025
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,120
execution on at endpoint and what I

1026
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,860
found from less about my own home

1027
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,740
network was the log 4G exploit that was

1028
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,899
available didn't quite work so I fixed

1029
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,580
it a little bit up and published it to

1030
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,980
internal yet okay next week on a client

1031
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,960
engagement ran the same export and got a

1032
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
shell on a ubiquity endpoint I was like

1033
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,740
oh this is running this the same stuff

1034
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,899
so running running lasts not really

1035
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,100
important

1036
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,039
home lobs as well it's not a man's

1037
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,320
requirement but it does help so if you

1038
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,000
are unsure about a topic or you're

1039
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,380
unsure about technology you're unsure

1040
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,179
about how to do something maybe you're

1041
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,460
really interested in SQL injection and

1042
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,840
you've been through like hack the Box

1043
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,340
you've been through like try hack me and

1044
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,799
you're still not quite fulfill that

1045
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,480
hunger you're that the fulfilled that

1046
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,700
understanding I think a whole lot and

1047
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,380
looking at how it's built will allow you

1048
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,899
to understand it better I still stand by

1049
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,700
the mythology of Bill break the fanfics

1050
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,860
so if you can build something understand

1051
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,720
how it's put together understand the

1052
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,760
specific configurations you can be

1053
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,779
better at breaking it because you're

1054
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,100
going to look at how these things are

1055
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,899
put together and what the things you can

1056
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,240
talk about equally if you can build it

1057
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,380
and break it you're probably going to

1058
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,580
understand how you want to defend it

1059
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,260
because you want to you've got it built

1060
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,820
up so you can hope that you perform the

1061
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,260
attack you understand how the attack

1062
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,359
Works how to defend against that well

1063
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,560
what are the mitigations what are the

1064
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,820
character measures that you can apply to

1065
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,980
mitigate that I don't think we can

1066
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,540
affectionate because because you've got

1067
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,000
the full full chain you can look at is

1068
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,980
that a quick fix this is it a case that

1069
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,739
like ms08 also SIM for example it's a

1070
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,619
patch I mean if you're running in a

1071
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,239
production environment Windows Server

1072
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,159
2003 or Windows XP you've already got

1073
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,020
other problems which is Legacy systems

1074
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,580
you've got like a pass management might

1075
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,540
have

1076
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,119
um like although ATMs or things like

1077
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,339
that might run uh 2K3 but having

1078
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,080
understanding how to fix it like maybe a

1079
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,239
patch or maybe a really

1080
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,879
um long-winded process so adcs like

1081
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,199
there's probably about earlier on the

1082
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,739
process to fix that is uh

1083
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,139
um service is vulnerable but and for

1084
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,399
some of them you can apply like a

1085
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,359
management

1086
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,000
um things called like manager it's like

1087
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,040
some something configure manager but if

1088
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
you apply that setting and the

1089
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,580
certificate when you go to request it so

1090
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,560
that if actually if a DCS as you request

1091
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,359
the certificate on behalf of a user

1092
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,880
using a different UPN which is the

1093
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,160
username and you can impersonate that

1094
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,359
user you request the camera is looking

1095
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,460
for it it's like average ticket for it

1096
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,500
and then you derive the Intel and hash

1097
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,420
you can use that ntlm hash can I go back

1098
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,160
to clear text then you have good text

1099
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,420
credentials or you can use it in like

1100
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,920
past the hash or you can use the Kerber

1101
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,900
ticket in like an in-person tax use it

1102
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,060
important intercession and access things

1103
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,520
but by applying that management

1104
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
um feature what that means is when you

1105
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
request a certificate it goes for

1106
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,520
manager approval so the the whole

1107
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,900
attaching is broke at that point because

1108
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,420
when you're when like set certifying or

1109
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,040
certain either the two tools that are

1110
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
used to applying the latest

1111
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,700
implementation instead of finding the

1112
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,859
c-sharp windows implementation you can

1113
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:48,780
run C sharp Linux but this kind of

1114
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,180
business and when they go to request the

1115
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,760
certificate the um the the approval

1116
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,619
comes the it goes to approval and if

1117
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,480
it's not on automatic approval or if

1118
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,760
there's not a sale for that that'll flag

1119
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,020
it all out to the sock it'll probably

1120
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,700
flag it alert if you've got to set up

1121
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,460
and to it to approve it and if it is

1122
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,800
getting a random request from either of

1123
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Dave's iPhone or whatever the host name

1124
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,800
then that looks suspicious and they're

1125
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,359
hopefully not going to prove it they'll

1126
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,980
fall asleep guys

1127
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,280
uh so each Aiden's just like falling

1128
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,500
asleep so yeah working working with

1129
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,940
customers and Consulting effectively

1130
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,560
building up experience and taking charge

1131
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,940
so when I say taking charge in

1132
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,280
environments talking about the situation

1133
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,660
earlier on where you're on a call with

1134
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,520
maybe multiple clients multiple

1135
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,500
um

1136
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,119
consultances multiple vendors if you

1137
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,040
know a topic really well and you can

1138
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,260
explain it to multiple audiences that

1139
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,619
comes in handy a lot you can take your

1140
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,000
understanding of it and you can just

1141
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,099
apply it to the call you can speak to an

1142
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,359
Executives you can speak to care for

1143
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,359
people and you can switch pins quickly

1144
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,400
and that's another important skill so

1145
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,040
delivering your value is if you're able

1146
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,520
to take context on something uh it takes

1147
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,859
equal injection as an example and so

1148
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,420
seek rejections and vulnerability and

1149
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,099
databases and you if you can take that

1150
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,780
and explain it the executive on the same

1151
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,280
call so they might be like what SQL

1152
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,140
injection it's like well you've got a

1153
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,180
database or you've got like a collection

1154
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,800
of things you want to get information

1155
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,680
from and what I can do is I can inject

1156
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,200
or I can add additional characters or

1157
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,480
additional strings to that collection

1158
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,520
and I can pull out arbitrary data so I

1159
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,660
can extract the information I should

1160
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,760
have access to why is that a risk right

1161
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,800
well it's a risk because

1162
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,619
as as an attacker as a malicious

1163
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,180
employee what I can do is I can attack

1164
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,920
the application and I can pull it

1165
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,020
personal identifier and permission we'll

1166
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,040
wait here well the impact is you've got

1167
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,119
potential Financial impact you've got

1168
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,859
potential data disclosure you might have

1169
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,140
legal impact depending on what area of

1170
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,460
the what levels you're working in if

1171
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,900
you're based in Europe you've got things

1172
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,540
like gdpr to deal with so if you're

1173
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,359
exposing customer data or personal

1174
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,640
identification of your customers or your

1175
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
employees your subject to their Privacy

1176
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
Law you're subject to potential impact

1177
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,700
from Regulators equally if you're doing

1178
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,680
the compliance route if you've got

1179
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,180
um SQL injection again if you've got SQL

1180
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,920
injection inside a card for the data

1181
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,660
environment that allows you to maybe get

1182
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,000
a shell so remote code execution from

1183
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,920
your corporate Network into your CDE

1184
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
that's a problem because as a standards

1185
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,660
attacker or standard center user I can

1186
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,180
go from what should be two segregated

1187
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,040
networks via an application that can I

1188
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,320
can get execution inside the CDE it

1189
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,180
might be that the communication between

1190
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,880
the staff the corporate Network are are

1191
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,740
totally segregating to the Fireballs

1192
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,660
this walking access the application is

1193
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,460
allowed through for some reason

1194
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,380
so if you can get command execution you

1195
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,880
are suck a bit in the cross boundary and

1196
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,260
therefore introducing additional

1197
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,540
interesting things

1198
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,820
so the other thing was to talk about is

1199
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,460
qualifying findings from V8 to pen test

1200
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,020
so this wonderful meme is um you won't

1201
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,980
be able to read it back it's really

1202
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,320
difficult to read up here you've got SSL

1203
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,420
version 2 and version three uh basically

1204
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,140
SSL and TLS findings now out of the box

1205
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,800
nessus reports uh SSL V2 and V3 is a

1206
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
critical risk as a CVSs 9.8 now what

1207
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,680
that means is that apparently you can go

1208
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,500
and just pop and decrypt it has the

1209
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,720
data because it's a critical right wrong

1210
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,099
however

1211
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,200
this is a this is someone raised it to

1212
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,700
enter the reason I'm talking about this

1213
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,480
is

1214
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,339
um when you get findings like this and

1215
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,960
you get outputs from running back this

1216
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,579
is from nessus but it's applicable to uh

1217
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,980
quality specificable to akinetics a lot

1218
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,000
of different tools they have different

1219
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
ways of scoring things

1220
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,079
um

1221
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,660
as far it's not weird there are no

1222
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,180
actionable exploits unless you are state

1223
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,820
sponsored of compromising V2 V3 like

1224
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,700
there's no execution there's no

1225
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,020
quantifiable risk however

1226
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,000
so if you're doing like PCI ESS or

1227
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,380
payment card industry you're dealing

1228
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,660
with yeah Cardinal data you will

1229
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,880
probably feel compliance for having

1230
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,619
the wrong version of TMS the wrong

1231
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,560
version of SSL which is why here a

1232
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,940
critical rest of the critical rest is

1233
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,560
that you're in risk of failing

1234
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,540
compliance from an exploitability

1235
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,980
perspective it's not critical but from

1236
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,720
our complacent there is

1237
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,640
consequently there are a lot of

1238
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,200
informational findings that are actually

1239
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
critical so

1240
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,880
a really nice finding that nasus raises

1241
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,560
I use Nest is going to use it I use

1242
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,960
necessary examples of use it quite a lot

1243
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,300
um Cisco smart installed which is a

1244
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,520
vulnerability that affects Cisco devices

1245
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,920
formula and it opens up an FTP server

1246
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,720
and you can access it and you can access

1247
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,280
the configuration you can get all good

1248
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,780
execution that's really there's an

1249
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,400
information within the nurses that

1250
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,660
should be a critical risk because you're

1251
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,359
going from network access so on the

1252
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,500
network or maybe external offices

1253
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,839
external facing to access to the switch

1254
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,820
and access to execution on the switch

1255
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,579
this is a problem similarly and you've

1256
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,480
got

1257
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,339
proxy shell so proxy shell is a

1258
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,780
vulnerability that affects it makes soft

1259
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,760
exchange and it is raised so nurses has

1260
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,619
got various checks that it does and a

1261
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,240
lot of scanners it costs us the same

1262
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,560
thing where it will be if it can't

1263
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,020
resolve the URL it's like well it's not

1264
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,099
available because I can't resolve the

1265
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,540
URL but it doesn't bother to check well

1266
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,560
because it doesn't bother to check

1267
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,599
things so automatically it takes what

1268
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,920
would you create a risk in Marxism

1269
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,359
permission risk so building up that

1270
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,440
understanding of the environment

1271
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,520
building up the understanding of like

1272
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,619
home lab and doing things allows you to

1273
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,079
take that context and build it up around

1274
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,359
what you're looking at to then take the

1275
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,119
risk apply the context to the risk and

1276
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,560
then Mark is a critical may not be a

1277
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,720
critical might be a high risk but

1278
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,700
it's just ridiculous you see this kind

1279
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,920
of stuff so qualifying findings for

1280
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,800
theater appendix look at the output from

1281
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,240
a scanner is one thing looking at the

1282
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,260
environments and other things with

1283
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,000
scanners they're nothing to understand

1284
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,500
especially if you're starting out

1285
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,300
scanners don't pick up everything the

1286
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,980
one thing that they pick up quite a lot

1287
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,660
of the time is things that lack of patch

1288
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,940
management things like lack of

1289
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,040
um like specific specific things that

1290
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,380
are maybe update or Legacy software

1291
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,339
things like that it'll pick up

1292
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,540
governance failures they don't pick up

1293
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,800
less configurations they don't pick up

1294
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
things that are in protocol level

1295
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,940
unabilities so things like cameras so

1296
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,500
Kerberos thing is availability that

1297
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,640
affects it's not even a vulnerability

1298
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,400
it's a feature that is exploitable and

1299
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,560
enables an attacker to request curlers

1300
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,359
tickets for service accounts that have

1301
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,220
got uh principal names which uh service

1302
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,020
principal name SPN

1303
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,780
to effect to access specific services on

1304
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,520
the machine and as an attacker I can

1305
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,260
request Kerberos tickets using Kerberos

1306
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,040
attack

1307
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,380
those tickets back to clear text and

1308
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,240
have the clear text credentials for that

1309
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,540
account

1310
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,520
having understanding of the environment

1311
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,500
and looking at it from uh CIS admin

1312
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,560
perspective so if you um so taking care

1313
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,060
of things for example if you run Ed

1314
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,280
Explorer which is a CIS internals tool

1315
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,260
um which is signed by Microsoft you can

1316
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,119
run it on an endpoint it does have some

1317
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,800
indicators component indicates like that

1318
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,660
but run at an endpoint you go through

1319
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,280
the active directory output so ad

1320
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,540
Explorer will allow you to connect to

1321
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,760
the domain controller with a set

1322
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,920
standard domain credentials and what it

1323
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,500
gives you is a printout of all of the

1324
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,880
information active directory so you've

1325
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,960
got users you've got your groups you've

1326
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,980
got Steph templates you've got

1327
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,780
configurations you've got organization

1328
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,020
organizational units runs off the tongue

1329
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,819
um and you've got everything in between

1330
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,619
and you've also got service principal

1331
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,060
names in there and you've got the

1332
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,099
information about the the specific users

1333
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,440
with an ads or running that looking at

1334
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,119
it and stepping through it manually you

1335
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,800
can pull that information together and

1336
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,599
form the attack pack off of that so

1337
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,920
that's not necessarily available certain

1338
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,000
findings but that is taking

1339
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,500
understanding of an environment and

1340
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,240
applying it to a specific binding

1341
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,760
similarly looking at this happened tools

1342
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,740
and exploiting them for for evil is also

1343
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,079
really interesting so and again not so

1344
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,400
much fun about a certain but you never

1345
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,900
touch some tricks looking at the system

1346
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,940
travel Suite if you get a chance to run

1347
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,380
it in your home lab don't hold all the

1348
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,640
system down the street and look at them

1349
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,200
there are lots of different tools that

1350
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,520
have been written over the years that do

1351
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,800
lots of very specific things but the

1352
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,839
work inside of balance because these

1353
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,220
circumvents are they circumvent

1354
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,920
detection and they're quite interesting

1355
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,140
to look at equally from a defensive

1356
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,400
standpoint you've got things like proc

1357
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,079
one process explorers this one they're

1358
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,460
all in this is how sweet they're used

1359
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,380
for um modern processes they're quite

1360
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,700
interesting from a defensive standpoint

1361
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,020
so

1362
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,980
yeah running a little bit behind time or

1363
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,780
ahead of time anyway I've got 14 minutes

1364
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,180
left has anyone got any questions from

1365
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,740
the rubbish I've told you for the last

1366
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,160
five minutes

1367
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,540
don't I'll rush it once

1368
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,599
at the back yep

1369
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,300
so the question was looking at people

1370
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,460
processing technology where the common

1371
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,079
um common faults

1372
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,020
I think in more in less mature

1373
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,700
organizations technological faults tend

1374
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,319
to be that the big ones like the kind of

1375
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:44,760
technical debts is quite a big one so

1376
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,319
you might have a lot of controls in

1377
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,780
place but you're not necessarily got the

1378
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,119
um protections around understanding and

1379
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,540
in more equally the the people I hate

1380
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,680
the things that people are the weakest

1381
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,319
Gene but almost always you can social

1382
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,180
engineer someone you can catch them off

1383
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,220
guard you can fetch them I mean I I love

1384
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,839
it I've been fishing for it it happens

1385
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,000
everyone is viable to it you might be in

1386
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,800
a situation whereby it's just the right

1387
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,020
time to catch someone process and

1388
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,940
procedural faults they go hand in hand

1389
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,560
with technical debt and Technical faults

1390
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,920
so there isn't a one one answer for all

1391
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,480
it depends in the organization I'd say

1392
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
in a pen test nowadays with mature

1393
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,319
organizations The Faults I tend to find

1394
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,359
are people and procedure evolves they

1395
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:25,980
have the technical controls down to a t

1396
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,780
like I've worked in organizations where

1397
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,980
they've got

1398
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,599
um like really secure active directories

1399
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,040
so they've got tiered Administration

1400
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,480
models in place where about you need to

1401
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,200
use

1402
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,700
um your admin account access different

1403
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,800
layers you need to Traverse up okay vice

1404
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,720
versa whether procedural faults there

1405
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,180
whereby the MFA tokens issued or SMS and

1406
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,980
if you can intercept the SMS or you can

1407
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,020
do a Sim Swap and again you have a token

1408
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,599
then there's problems there

1409
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,640
so yeah it's applicable to different

1410
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,680
organizations

1411
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,359
anyone else

1412
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,020
yep

1413
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,339
yes

1414
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,560
so to answer both questions the question

1415
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,060
was do you think external pen testing in

1416
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,220
his current model is broken yes or no

1417
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,859
I'd say for the most part

1418
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,960
the the beauty of people who get into

1419
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,400
pen testing is being able to think on

1420
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,480
your feet and be able to learn new

1421
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,859
technologies while you don't have the

1422
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,900
full context around the organization the

1423
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,819
model itself of external pen testing is

1424
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,520
valid but the way it's applied in

1425
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,800
different markets is is wrong

1426
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,260
I think that the way that the UK market

1427
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,819
for the most part approaches external

1428
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,920
pain testing is incorrect and looking at

1429
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,660
it from uh

1430
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,400
the UK Market looks external pain

1431
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,780
testing for the most part from a

1432
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,160
compliance perspective most of the time

1433
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,480
it's either check work or it's looking

1434
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
at like clients attack box they need to

1435
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,839
detect they've got two years to test

1436
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,700
five thousand IPS you're not going to

1437
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,200
testify those IPS in three days you're

1438
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,819
probably gonna scan them okay they've

1439
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,200
got nothing open or whatever you're not

1440
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,640
going to amply test the organization

1441
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,140
you're going to look at

1442
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,680
um

1443
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,780
here you'll see things like Cloud you're

1444
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,579
going to see things like reporting the

1445
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,859
thing I learned from moving from a UK

1446
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,780
company a US company is

1447
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,339
um and I'm not sure if this is exclusive

1448
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:14,160
to lares we don't stop so an external

1449
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,740
pain test in the UK was come on this is

1450
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,560
fine stuff whatever in the states it's

1451
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,260
like Wild West it's like right

1452
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,180
Brute Force if the client doesn't

1453
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,740
specify the social engineer is not a

1454
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,060
scope it's probably in scope so you can

1455
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,160
fetch people and do whatever and to go

1456
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,720
back to your point of the context around

1457
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,420
the organization I agree that you the

1458
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,140
the

1459
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,700
um the models are on the Block context

1460
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,319
but that's why working with a customer

1461
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,240
and building their trust is important

1462
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,740
because they can hopefully give you

1463
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,839
context on what you're looking at so

1464
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,520
whereby you might be looking at a system

1465
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,800
that you think is ridiculously severe

1466
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,060
and it's actually that this is a Dev

1467
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,380
system but it's not called therefore

1468
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,359
whatever so communication it goes down

1469
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,280
communicating with the client

1470
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,380
yep

1471
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,380
um

1472
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:03,960
how do you have any tips for

1473
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,400
seeing the clients when they're

1474
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,760
prescribed where he wanted

1475
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,200
the bus service and you know

1476
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,720
so pushback's an interesting one and you

1477
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,819
do get it quite a lot and the first

1478
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:19,859
thing is remaining Cam and understanding

1479
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,980
that don't take it personally and I've

1480
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,420
had a lot of colleagues in the past who

1481
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,560
take you personally and they're like oh

1482
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,880
this client's attacking me because

1483
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,020
that's like no they're probably pushing

1484
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,819
back to their budget

1485
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,920
um when you're conversing with clients

1486
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,500
try and speak their language so if

1487
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,700
you're trying to convince them and bring

1488
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,200
them on board to do something if they

1489
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,060
are focused on risk talk to them about

1490
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,579
risk if they are focused on up time but

1491
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,859
a lot of payments they're focused on

1492
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,720
um organizational maturity talk about

1493
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,460
how pen testing can fit into that

1494
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,619
maturity model and looking at how they

1495
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,540
do business maybe do a little bit of

1496
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,500
background research say well actually

1497
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,880
you haven't pushback can we have it on a

1498
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,319
call a bit less or maybe discuss this

1499
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,760
over here look at what the organization

1500
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,319
does maybe ask them about what their

1501
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,819
current security model and security

1502
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,859
program looks like and then what you can

1503
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,099
do to add to that and don't turn it into

1504
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,140
a shirt and match I've seen I've worked

1505
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,520
with consultants in the past you're like

1506
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,980
 you I'm right in verbatim just

1507
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,060
straight up until they're quite off

1508
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,339
don't do that it's not not the best

1509
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,319
approach so

1510
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,839
yeah just just get down and talk talk

1511
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,640
The Language and and if if you're still

1512
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,079
getting pushed back convertible

1513
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,780
colleagues ask us what they would do the

1514
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,099
other thing that I didn't really mention

1515
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,260
was how you deliver actual value work

1516
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,700
with who you're working with so if

1517
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,140
you're if you're in an organization with

1518
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,180
lots of Consultants the chances are

1519
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,680
you're not going to be the first person

1520
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,079
that's come across this specific problem

1521
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,760
if it's dealing with clients or if it's

1522
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,380
dealing with the technology speak to who

1523
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,780
you're working with collaborate don't be

1524
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,420
alone will like try and collaborate

1525
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,099
fostering collaboration is something I'm

1526
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,960
a massive advocate of and working

1527
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
working with people working with who you

1528
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,839
work with and working on people's

1529
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,480
strengths is is invaluable and not just

1530
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,700
any organization if you if you've got

1531
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,079
people that you can speak to in the

1532
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,940
industry obviously stripping out client

1533
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,900
names and things but you've got a

1534
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,880
specific problem taking that pushing

1535
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,560
back from class if you can ask someone

1536
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,420
this movie come across so well I've got

1537
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,500
this client situation and they're

1538
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,180
pushing back as if not about X control

1539
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,220
advice on like a wide control in place

1540
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,319
and just saying what do you think and to

1541
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,380
get someone else's opinions most of them

1542
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,040
anyone else

1543
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,460
nope

1544
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,520
cool uh well so if anyone wants to fall

1545
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,380
in swear I don't post technical content

1546
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,880
anymore most of the time I share post I

1547
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,020
am going to get back to posting

1548
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,880
technical content at some point

1549
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,260
um I take about four words now so I've

1550
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,839
got a force blog and any tools and

1551
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,220
contributions and stuff I have no

1552
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,720
excited GitHub because I know it's hard

1553
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,700
writing code again so

1554
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,500
