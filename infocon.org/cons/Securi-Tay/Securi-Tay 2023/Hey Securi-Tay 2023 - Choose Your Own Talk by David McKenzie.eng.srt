1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,520
this is choose your own talk so I

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,720
originally wrote this a couple of years

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,700
ago when I go uh

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,900
Kino

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,380
thrust upon me a very short notice and

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,540
had no real idea what was going to

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,380
happen so uh the normal bits and Dave

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,060
McKenzie half the people that should

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,980
know me

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,380
I took out stick I'm old I

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,000
currently cyber security operations

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
Director of National gas which used to

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,020
be National Grid and they sold it and it

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,760
all got really complicated but

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,100
essentially yeah that's me I've done 80

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,500
support and some response uh I'm a

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
vulnerability Wrangler not a major one

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
uh like somebody that sneaked into the

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,940
room light

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,320
and do a couple of groups and stuff like

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,579
that and if you're interested in any of

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,079
that come and see me and I'm more than

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,059
happy to chat about me

24
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,680
outside of this

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,420
right

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,239
when I originally did this one whenever

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,699
I do a talk I always try and have a hook

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,180
like a trick a fun thing something that

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,420
means that someone will remember

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,180
me the talk and hopefully if if I give

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,740
you something entertaining you might

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,240
remember some of the serious stuff

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,460
hopefully the stuff that keeps you sane

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,299
later in life that would be good uh so

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,759
when we did it originally

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,320
uh

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,140
okay but everything I went all out

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,400
um

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
there was an option in the talk that

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,600
made everybody immediately show it as a

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,840
shoot Scott with the Nerf gun

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,340
um

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,460
and amazingly

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,700
it worked uh

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,280
that boy is so scared it's unreal in me

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
but like I'm on the stage it's like

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
probably about like that this is that

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,420
cheer and I could see him trembling the

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,579
fear was there and I was winding them up

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,720
and everything because he went and he

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
got ready and I was like no no put the

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,420
safety glasses on put the safety glasses

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,119
on uh of course just added to the fear

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,799
all the way through uh but you can't

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,259
make it today so we won't be shooting uh

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,780
a cup of Scott's head unfortunately

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,500
because that'd be fun but I do promise

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,099
that we will do something similar

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,540
but

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,020
how this works

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,760
first we need to pick the slides that

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
we're going to talk about

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,540
now

64
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,280
another funny story about a conference

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,379
is that uh

66
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,780
I like conferences I like you know the

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,640
community and stuff like that uh but uh

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,220
we dare we do have to Petco we get

69
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,920
slides and there is someone in the room

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,620
that's really better about Pac-Man where

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,959
is he

72
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,060
oh hi Mike

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,900
so uh

74
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,560
there is a see if we get it wrong like

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
so if we get like a pink ghost or

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,340
something like that then the talks are

77
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,959
not going to be that interested although

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,400
some of them are mildly entertaining

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
because that really went out with the

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,720
jokes on the slight Styles uh so let's

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
not go with that uh

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
because nobody wants 10 minutes of

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,940
silence and

84
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,040
Scott's not here to go on about engine I

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,599
mean Dolan's here so we can definitely

86
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,500
do number 14.

87
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,780
we'll come back round to that don't it

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,080
don't worry

89
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,800
all we need to do

90
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,739
[Music]

91
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,500
waitress number 10 uh

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,860
yeah uh your callum's not here so no no

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,210
years

94
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,130
[Laughter]

95
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm gonna do is Mike's gonna come down

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,239
and give us a hand because Mike's

97
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,610
awesome around Applause for Mike please

98
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,980
[Applause]

99
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,959
so uh does anybody know the difference

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
between social engineering and Magic

101
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,879
now and go with that

102
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,000
right

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,939
nice

104
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,500
although depends how successful you are

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,299
in the magic and probably in the social

106
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,120
engineering uh the difference is when

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
you do magic people are supposed to walk

108
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,940
away feeling good when you do social

109
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,780
engineering not so much right Mike we

110
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,699
got

111
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,180
kind of three five files

112
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,500
pack two piles

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,979
right okay

114
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,540
no we don't

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,780
three Pals see math brilliant

116
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
uh

117
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,320
you know a bit faster I see

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,780
all right come on pick it up all right

119
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,020
okay

120
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,520
pick a card

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,800
okay

122
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,759
pick another card

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,680
oh it's a Pac-Man it doesn't work

124
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,139
oh and completely cocked out the magic

125
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,600
took

126
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,759
that is really annoying that's what I

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,880
get

128
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,919
you're dead you won so that's that's

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
like on the plus side if that's the only

130
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
demo trick thing that goes wrong

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
awesome

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,580
right so uh

133
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,979
let's go with the orange ghost right so

134
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,280
the way this works is

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,139
somebody show you a number uh we're not

136
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,419
doing number 12 until like two or three

137
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,500
in

138
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,680
because because otherwise you know

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
 everybody does seven always the

140
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
first one

141
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,199
so uh

142
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
always like it's every time I do a Talk

143
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,940
number seven's the the first one that

144
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,740
everybody picks because it's essentially

145
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,960
we're all ghouls um

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,759
and the reason which we're talking about

147
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,940
worse than ever if you think about it uh

148
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,699
what do you mean by worst

149
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,180
so you could go with how much money

150
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,479
uh somebody lost uh somebody lose their

151
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,180
job the company go under it all comes

152
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,580
down to impact uh and one of the really

153
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,020
disappointing things about impact is

154
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,759
if you actually look at the impactor

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,979
company

156
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,220
what happens when a company releases

157
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,199
this massive breach

158
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,720
the share price goes down for 10 minutes

159
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,460
and then it pops back up again and it's

160
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,239
business as usual

161
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,539
uh um LastPass is an interest one so uh

162
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,340
as one of the previous talks today went

163
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,460
like all security vendors get hacked uh

164
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,800
and all of them are mostly still there

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,039
so what do you do about that uh LastPass

166
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,780
was a very targeted and interesting

167
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,060
attack and in as much the first one was

168
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,479
a bug standards then you get and we got

169
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,860
a bunch of encrypted stuff that was

170
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,500
useless and then they went really really

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,900
really targeted because they wanted to

172
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,259
decrypt the stuff and then it became a

173
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,460
really

174
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,580
I mean I'm not sure many organizations

175
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,340
in the world could have prevented what

176
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,139
happened to that senior Dev

177
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,060
because they came after me okay right so

178
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,360
he was using Plex server uh and then

179
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,639
they they may or may not have hacked

180
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,500
Plex to get a crap version of it down

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,360
onto him some people are speculating and

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
stuff like that but ultimately it's that

183
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,560
whole I can use my personal laptop and

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,500
then I got the key logger on there and

185
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,120
then they got his master password for

186
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,120
login that's a lot of effort

187
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,699
by people who are very very determined

188
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,520
to get in and your next stage after that

189
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,080
level of determination is walking up and

190
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,460
second a gun to somebody's head and

191
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,759
saying type your password in here

192
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,060
at that point you go sure not a problem

193
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,199
uh so yeah LastPass will

194
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,319
stock price or tank about three to four

195
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,900
months time with back where it was

196
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,599
nah

197
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,220
it's too big to go well they're not too

198
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,660
big to go in they're not quite that big

199
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,180
but I don't think uh none of the other

200
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,219
ones have uh

201
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,620
they are in a slightly unique situation

202
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,380
because they're one of the first kinda

203
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,159
password managers to to get it I mean

204
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,200
I.E password manager Chrome password

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,180
manager used to get popped all the time

206
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,880
and people that now and now the release

207
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
better versions are secure they're

208
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,440
excellent I still don't trust to save my

209
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
password in my browser in fact we spent

210
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,399
years teaching people not to do that and

211
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,620
pleading with them not to do that and

212
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,060
now it looks like it actually might be

213
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,920
one of the more safe places to keep it

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,060
you know right okay

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
no no no

216
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,180
can we enter that out

217
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,089
[Laughter]

218
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,580
circling back to the topic the worst

219
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,480
impacts the worst incident ever for me

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,540
uh was actually a review of an incident

221
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,620
that I did

222
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,120
for a law

223
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,019
firm a stroke insurers that was actually

224
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,700
looking at how an incident was handled

225
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,500
and exactly what happened so I ended up

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,360
interviewing a lot of people that were

227
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,839
involved uh and in that one there was a

228
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,220
breaker process you know like that

229
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,500
anybody was in Andy's one was the whole

230
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,940
You've got people process and Technology

231
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,940
sort of thing the process broke

232
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,480
because it covered and it was a well

233
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,120
normally uh to change those Bank details

234
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,519
we would do a phone call between that

235
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,620
person or would go to that person's desk

236
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,959
or phone them but since they'd all just

237
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,660
gone home nobody had any phones nobody

238
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,880
had the ability to go to somebody's desk

239
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,399
to confirm it so the person

240
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,380
just emailed them and of course when

241
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,360
you're emailing the hacked email account

242
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,080
that's not a great uh check uh

243
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,820
that person lost a job never actually

244
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,060
got to talk to her uh but the actual

245
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,800
person whose email account was

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,100
compromised was a lawyer uh lots of

247
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,500
money went walking out the door and he'd

248
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,540
been off when I spoke to him he'd been

249
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,560
out of work for two months with stress

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
because he blamed himself

251
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,820
there was nothing he could do I mean

252
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,519
he's like business email compromise

253
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,000
uh it does the even it's it happens

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,339
there's no MFA so it's not like he

255
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,959
failed because he didn't turn into the

256
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,700
company and say you must have MFA on my

257
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,800
account I mean that's what we're here

258
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,320
and it's there to do is to confirm that

259
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,300
these controls are in place so it's not

260
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,279
that guy's fault

261
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,680
but he was broken

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
and

263
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,760
from that point on it's always every

264
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,940
time I look at an incident it's always

265
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,860
that always comes back to mind so all

266
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,120
the other ones and all the other crazy

267
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,860
incidents and two in the mornings and

268
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,120
these sorts of things

269
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,420
they all just become Tuesday uh it was a

270
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,980
running it was a running joke we used to

271
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,079
do uh but that one always always

272
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,640
remember I didn't even have to work in

273
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,100
the incident it was literally the fact

274
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,839
that uh this poor

275
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,980
person was so broken by it

276
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,140
and it wasn't his fault at all he never

277
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,260
like okayed any giant transfer of monies

278
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,300
or changes or Account Details and stuff

279
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,420
like that and yet that person it's his

280
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,579
email address he thought he was going to

281
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,019
lose his job and all these sorts of

282
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,060
things he likes nothing new you so the

283
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,360
impact for me the the impact that

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,579
matters the most

285
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,519
are the people that are involved the the

286
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,620
users that got I mean

287
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,880
because they're the ones that always

288
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,560
feel that they've failed somehow even

289
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,720
though really in most cases we failed

290
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,399
them or it's failed them or the

291
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,440
companies failed them but they always

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
take it the the hardest and they worry

293
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,740
about whether they're going to be able

294
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,420
to feed their kids next week and things

295
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,740
like that because

296
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,680
so financially yes money goes at the

297
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,420
door but insurance ends up and giving it

298
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,160
back sometimes depending on current

299
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,839
cyber Insurance uh things reputation uh

300
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,240
yeah we all laugh at like various things

301
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,040
like you know Florida Gates and things

302
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,800
of that but people still buy them

303
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,740
um so yeah ultimately

304
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,320
the org stroke that doesn't matter our

305
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,019
reputation doesn't matter Finance unless

306
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,220
you put the company out of business

307
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,200
that's a terrible thing but most

308
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,180
incidents don't do that

309
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,779
um

310
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,880
for the actual people that are affected

311
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,500
by it or that are the worst ones that

312
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,660
come out of it and they're the ones that

313
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,120
nobody ever talks about

314
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,540
uh so if you are ever involved in an

315
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,339
incident

316
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,720
make sure that the people you're talking

317
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,579
to are you we're quite good at making

318
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,200
sure the other instant responders around

319
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,779
us are good if the if somebody isn't

320
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,279
checking that you're still alive need

321
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,459
pizza Coke beer time off whatever then

322
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,480
change company but uh to me the the

323
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,980
biggest thing is nobody ever actually

324
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,860
goes to make sure that the victims are

325
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,600
actually okay everybody thinks the org's

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,160
got a problem oh my God all the systems

327
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
are done would be ransomwards the person

328
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,060
that received the email and clicked on

329
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,260
it

330
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,700
they're the one that's sitting there

331
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,139
going well all this chaos is happening

332
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,720
they're sitting in tears so spare them a

333
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,700
moment to take you two minutes to say

334
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,459
hey this wasn't your fault and you might

335
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,320
save them like two months of mental

336
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
anguish

337
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,980
right

338
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,060
you have no idea how hard it is to

339
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,399
animate like this in a nice Loop uh in

340
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,339
PowerPoint uh yeah to think it was easy

341
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,680
but now

342
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,579
right give me a number

343
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
what was that 10 profit from fear of

344
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
misery so this is this has come up today

345
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,240
as well uh to be honest uh and I can go

346
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,880
and click on it just because

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,540
uh

348
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,420
it's been mentioned a couple of times in

349
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,279
passing and a couple of talks uh today

350
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,320
uh

351
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,220
a lot of what we do is telling people

352
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,680
that bad stuff might happen

353
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,139
and if they don't do something the bad

354
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,240
stuff's gonna happen

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,600
uh that sucks uh if you're having to

356
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,579
make your point by making someone

357
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,519
fearful you're not articulating it

358
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,540
properly

359
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,920
uh

360
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,440
if you sit and say no you will be hacked

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,480
if you don't do this it's not a great

362
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,699
conversation and you don't wander in and

363
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,420
try and sell somebody the third gen

364
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,220
firewalkers otherwise think of the

365
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,779
children

366
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,279
um

367
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,160
as an industry we suck at this mostly

368
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
because we're trying to protect things

369
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,279
we're all Defenders so by definition

370
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,899
we're trying to stop bad things from

371
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,459
happening but see as soon as you start

372
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,440
making that your sales tax mate if you

373
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,180
don't buy this bad things are going to

374
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
happen think of the children uh that's

375
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,199
not good

376
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,300
um so

377
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,139
security should be enabled an enabler

378
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,420
it shouldn't necessarily be something

379
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,519
that is unnecessarily a costing you

380
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,660
should be able to articulate your

381
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,120
security concerns and see and this

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
allows us to help keep things up

383
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
don't turn around and say if you don't

384
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,459
buy it it's all going to go down

385
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,380
because then you're just really dropping

386
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,899
into that fear thing and the problem is

387
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,760
you can only do that so many times from

388
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,459
purely selfish sales point of view if

389
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,620
you turn and say you don't buy this

390
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
you're going to get hacked they don't

391
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,279
buy it they don't get hacked you'll

392
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,660
never come back to that person that sell

393
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,220
them something are you

394
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,920
um and similarly you can't go in every

395
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,040
six months and say to the the CEO if you

396
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,480
don't buy this we're going to get hacked

397
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,920
is it yeah but you six months ago we

398
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,940
bought the thing to stop us getting

399
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,139
hacked

400
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,060
it's like yeah but this is the new

401
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,980
hackers and they've got new stuff it's

402
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,980
like yeah good luck on the fourth

403
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,600
iteration of that getting any money out

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,620
of it

405
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,220
um so yeah we are here to help people

406
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,100
ultimately uh unless you work for an

407
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,120
mssp and you look just uh

408
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,160
you do not work in cyber

409
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,199
if the company you work for doing

410
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,199
security makes plastic palm trees

411
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,620
I use plastic pantries a lot uh then you

412
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,899
are in plastic pantries

413
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,180
so everything you do should be about

414
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,800
making plastic pantries

415
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,740
so when you are talking to the rest of

416
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,480
your business so you're talking to the

417
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,759
people you should be talking about this

418
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,259
makes us better making plastic palm

419
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,899
trees hey these systems available that

420
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,459
went down that might affect our plastic

421
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,560
palm tree creation you don't have to sit

422
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,600
and say oh my God it's you're all going

423
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,180
to die but you can turn it and say look

424
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,799
there's some availability issues here

425
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,619
it's an operational risk it's the same

426
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,660
as if we didn't have fire alarms we

427
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,640
could have a problem the same as if we

428
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,260
don't have two of them and one of them

429
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,240
fails these are the ways that you can

430
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,220
talk to business you don't have to drop

431
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,339
into the if you don't have one of these

432
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,619
the children will die also plastic palm

433
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,510
trees won't get made

434
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,299
[Music]

435
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,079
um

436
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,380
so don't uh if you find yourself ever

437
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,660
doing pre-sales calls

438
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,240
and heading down the dark path towards

439
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,380
like

440
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,260
pushing Somebody by making something

441
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,660
sound scary you're not articulating

442
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,720
stuff properly you should re refocus and

443
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,940
go this is about availability this is

444
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,020
about keeping things up this is about

445
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,419
making us more secure more efficient

446
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,840
more resilient resilience is a great

447
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,179
work to talk about it makes us more

448
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,280
resilient not if we don't do it we're

449
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,240
gonna die

450
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,039
it makes us more resilient it means if

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,600
we do have something bad happen over

452
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,120
there that we can handle it those are

453
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,919
easy things to talk about and it's not

454
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,960
necessarily tournaments in so if you

455
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
don't do this we're all going to die

456
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,580
given my current job sometimes there is

457
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,020
if we don't do this we're all gonna die

458
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,799
but um

459
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,260
right oh

460
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,059
interesting okay

461
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,840
really issue

462
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,539
14 are you sitting uncomfortably nice

463
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,220
it's a new one I haven't done this one

464
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,400
before

465
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,200
um

466
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,620
[Applause]

467
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,960
incident response or digital forensics

468
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
who's doing it too has done or is doing

469
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,700
a digital forensics degree or it says

470
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,799
parents extended degree

471
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
good news you're going to be looking at

472
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,900
what genie in the office looks at on our

473
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,580
lunch break and you're going to wish you

474
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,120
never had

475
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,640
[Music]

476
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,900
uh and as much as uh I was once told I

477
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,059
was talking to a colleague that works in

478
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,940
digital forensics and they said 50 of

479
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,400
their workload came from HR asking them

480
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,780
to investigate internal staff

481
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,340
so um

482
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,220
there is uh I always talk about silos

483
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,260
and don't be a silos and try and make

484
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,640
sure you're part of the team and stuff

485
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,100
there is just a little bit of Asylum you

486
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,160
should keep around and just be careful

487
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,620
you will end up coming across whether

488
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,080
it's doing silk analysis instant

489
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
response some things you will come

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,419
across stuff on people's machines

491
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,900
and you look at it and you go hmm

492
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,960
it's not really the incident or the

493
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,820
security problem I'm looking at but it

494
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,260
probably shouldn't be doing that on

495
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,320
their work laptop during the day

496
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,919
um

497
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,740
having a good process for that stuff

498
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,720
is super important because otherwise

499
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
what you have is a sock analyst who

500
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,980
looks really confused and goes I'm not

501
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,660
sure what I'm supposed to do with this

502
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,100
and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to tell

503
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,820
anybody uh we have I'm having been an

504
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,520
mssp in the past come across a few times

505
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,820
where analysts will come you go

506
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,520
do we tell the customer

507
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,940
Gene in the office there's a paper yeah

508
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,100
is there an active security risk are

509
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,480
they using PornHub are they using some

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
dodgy version sites no use important not

511
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,720
brilliant that's absolutely fine don't

512
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,700
worry about it um

513
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,440
ultimately you can certainly say hey

514
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,020
look they're going to some inadvisable

515
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,760
sites that we know we can get malware

516
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
from

517
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,179
that's the closest you can get to report

518
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,460
and genie in the office vendor

519
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,470
habits

520
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,580
[Music]

521
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,240
uh

522
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,900
right give me a Dumber

523
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,299
15. oh right okay uh

524
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,220
another new one nice uh

525
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,780
you can now get chat GPT to write

526
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,399
incident responsive playbooks for you

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,980
so

528
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,340
that's a question isn't it uh you can

529
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,600
also train chat GPT and its Brethren to

530
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,660
do lots of really interesting things and

531
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,940
response if you are determined enough

532
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,000
and put enough responses into things you

533
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,260
can train it to give you the wrong

534
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,059
answer

535
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,919
or an amusing answer

536
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,059
um

537
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,820
but

538
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
as

539
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,799
AI it's been a like laughing joke in

540
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,960
cyber for

541
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,440
10 years uh because AI is going to come

542
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,539
along and solve all our problems uh

543
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,659
machine learning does help and if you

544
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,280
can give enough data to train on it and

545
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,679
what is normal

546
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,500
there are uses there

547
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,419
but

548
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,659
technology keeps moving and what you do

549
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,520
today as a soccer analyst might not be

550
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,020
what you do in five years as a soccer

551
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,020
analyst uh whatever you do don't get

552
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,900
stuck in your ways uh honestly if there

553
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,520
is a robot sitting at your desk when you

554
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,080
go in and people like him better than

555
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,600
you that's fine because it's a robot and

556
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,240
it's cool so just embrace the coolness

557
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
that is the robot uh but ultimately

558
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,039
you're going to have to keep learning

559
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,100
new things uh and

560
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,980
if chart GPT does give us

561
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,080
fantastic instant response playbooks

562
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,700
then why not use it to do the initial

563
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,020
part of the legwork and then check it

564
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,940
afterwards because if it saves you two

565
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,900
days

566
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,840
two days your life you get might be or

567
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
two days that your employer can use you

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,740
to do some other meaningless minion

569
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,100
tasks but you know what are those uh

570
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,600
the technology will keep getting better

571
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,539
and better the need for cyber will not

572
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,679
you're not allowed to leave in the

573
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,000
middle of my talk

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,539
shut up

575
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,559
was it the talker genie in the office

576
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,679
okay uh someone's already discovered a

577
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,000
laptop right

578
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,059
um

579
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,320
technology will keep moving process and

580
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,299
procedures have to keep moving if you're

581
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,039
investigating tickets exactly the same

582
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,740
way you did two years ago you're

583
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,720
probably missing a trick somebody should

584
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,220
have updated somebody should have

585
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,360
performed there especially if you're

586
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,679
doing the same thing every single time

587
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,720
it's like please go and automate that

588
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,700
it's called enrichment just go and do it

589
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
it's easy

590
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,559
but ultimately yeah except the fact that

591
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,120
in the Cyber industry your job is going

592
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,400
to change regardless of whether you get

593
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,020
a new job title or not

594
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
technology will keep moving you will

595
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,679
need to keep on top of that said

596
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,020
technology and sometimes robots will

597
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,120
come along and eat your snacks but

598
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,159
hopefully

599
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,500
uh that doesn't mean you're out of a job

600
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,880
it just means that you're the guy that's

601
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,320
in charge of Roblox and how cool what

602
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,860
job titles

603
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,580
right come on give me numbers

604
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,820
that's 30.

605
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,219
[Laughter]

606
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
uh

607
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,130
[Applause]

608
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,059
[Laughter]

609
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,400
there is a serious point to this I do

610
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,080
like to mess with donut

611
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,220
um

612
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,940
uh

613
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,140
if I if you look at it there's a ton of

614
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,480
Honeypot talks on today in fact guys

615
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,860
some things that are nearly need to do

616
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,500
and grab and say hello to uh but

617
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,380
ultimately uh yeah we're all talking the

618
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,340
same stuff we're all trying to do the

619
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,500
same things if somebody takes your

620
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,260
slides and like verbatim says word for

621
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,520
word what you said

622
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,020
that

623
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,820
do we do we need to have

624
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,120
okay yeah that's like that's a crap

625
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,559
thing but if you take somebody's idea

626
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,299
and says that inspired me and I go off

627
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,400
and investigate and do my own thing even

628
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
my honey pot talk at a conference that

629
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,780
was affiliated with another University

630
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,640
would probably not like if I say it on

631
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,480
stage that personal Flames uh

632
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,299
uh I did one in that inspired Donan to

633
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,919
want to go and do one on honeybots and

634
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,240
to be honest the one that I did on

635
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,580
honeypots was inspired by the fact that

636
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,140
I saw another one which I really hated

637
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,419
because the guy got it really wrong

638
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:31,500
um

639
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
it wasn't that anything he said was

640
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,640
incorrect he just didn't actually give

641
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,400
people the proper point of like why you

642
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,380
would want honeybots

643
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,179
and so it became a really they're really

644
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,279
really cool no point that he's saying

645
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,960
this is why you want one

646
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,000
um so that drove me slightly insane to

647
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,380
the point where I went next conference

648
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm doing a talk that says why you want

649
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,679
honeypots

650
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,340
um

651
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,140
so yeah uh don't steal be inspired

652
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,020
that works

653
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,460
I'll be working at your time

654
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,059
oh

655
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,679
thank you because I like this one uh

656
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,520
I often get commented on by corporate

657
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,500
Executives that I mean working companies

658
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,039
for of the you don't take things very

659
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,659
seriously or you always seem to be

660
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,580
having a laugh or a bit of a joke or why

661
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,260
have you got Nerf gun

662
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,320
um

663
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,539
it literally is if you don't

664
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,880
if you try and take every single thing

665
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,940
in your cyber career that seriously it's

666
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,220
going to break you I know I've kind of

667
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,100
been there at times uh

668
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,340
so ultimately make sure that the people

669
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,320
that you work with you get on with see

670
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,059
if you're sitting in a team

671
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,020
and you hate everybody

672
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,220
you probably need to move well one you

673
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,779
need to look at yourself and go how can

674
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,299
everybody hate me that

675
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,480
can it be all of them being wrong

676
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,460
but there is a hey make sure that you're

677
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,900
working with people that you know that

678
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,799
you trust

679
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,799
that you like uh

680
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,679
and just make sure that you don't get

681
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,200
dragged down into the here's another

682
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
ticket here's another ticket here's

683
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
another incident this is terrible

684
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,539
somebody stole this some of the the

685
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,400
worst incidents have dealt with have

686
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,620
been like chat like Children's Cancer

687
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,720
charity gets hacked

688
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,820
I mean honestly

689
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,279
it's like what kind of scum

690
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,279
would do that uh and let's face it they

691
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,380
don't even care they just if they

692
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,059
noticed it was a charity then they go

693
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,860
hey they probably got crap I.T and crap

694
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,779
processes so might get some stuff out of

695
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:52,799
it

696
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,779
But ultimately if you start taking that

697
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,760
stuff that seriously all the time you

698
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,080
don't have some sort of release

699
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,080
mechanism main is picking on doing

700
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,100
um

701
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,320
and sometimes make uh

702
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,559
But ultimately yeah it's uh you need to

703
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,900
find an Avenue to be able to deal with

704
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,059
this stuff sensibly

705
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,539
yes go have a hobby that isn't cyber or

706
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,700
isn't the same cyber that you do every

707
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,419
day

708
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,360
But ultimately make sure you've got

709
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,740
people around you that you can laugh

710
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,880
with because otherwise you cry and then

711
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,740
you can't work anymore

712
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,679
and you have to go meet plastic pantries

713
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,220
for 11.

714
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,140
that took longer

715
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
for

716
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,440
okay number two

717
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,419
which may require some assistance from

718
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,200
the studio audience

719
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,960
so it has been commented though

720
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,539

thing uh right so uh if Donan can get

769
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,340
some guidance from people that would be

770
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,200
super useful I'm trying to find my

771
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,419
safety glasses because there's zero

772
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,860
danger that I'm gonna stand over there

773
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,520
yeah

774
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,480
safety glasses

775
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,559
uh and what did those makeups over the

776
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,539
makeups over there

777
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,360
right so it is reasonably If people

778
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,939
could aim it slightly up from uh

779
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,739
right donut straight ahead

780
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,110

[Laughter]

782
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,200
really right so give them a hand to aim

783
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,980
it a little bit

784
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,500

oh right okay

809
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,638
uh

810
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,719
there's lots of focus on Blue teams red

811
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,780
teams uh purple team is obviously blue

812
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,300
and red uh telling me no more instant

813
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,839
responses

814
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,820
white or black sometimes

815
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,960
um

816
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,060
if you're an engineer you're uh

817
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,199
yeah sometimes yellow sometimes green

818
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,599
education or Ops is also orange and gold

819
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,239
and green it doesn't matter like find

820
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,599
what you want to do and go and do it uh

821
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,440
some of the best blue team people I know

822
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,418
wanted to be red team and because

823
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,159
they've had that training

824
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,800
made them really effective at Blue

825
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,359
still went off to Korean lunch but

826
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,500
that's fine

827
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,220
um

828
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,800
But ultimately uh

829
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
we're all in the industry to help make

830
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,619
plastic palm trees or whatever as our

831
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,119
company's there we're there to defend

832
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,740
and do good

833
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,500
if you get the vision

834
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,960
that gets sailored and then you don't

835
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,480
have good cons and things get a bit

836
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,540
squirrely so don't really worry

837
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,460
especially right now if you're in uni or

838
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,720
you just finish uni and you're going

839
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,820
what do I want to do I won't try stuff

840
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,780
go ask people that I mean I'm blue team

841
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,760
really because I've always done like

842
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,900
defense

843
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,300
but uh and I know plenty of people that

844
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,099
have never done anything but pen testing

845
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,300
I know plenty of people have never done

846
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,060
anything but instant response

847
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,040
But ultimately it doesn't matter we're

848
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,140
all there to do a job we're all there to

849
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,780
try and help our company or our

850
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,420
community or whatever we're doing we're

851
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,160
all there

852
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
trying to pull us all in the same way if

853
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,119
you end up having a fight in your

854
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,359
company with the pen testers in front of

855
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,339
the rest of the company

856
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,160
what does that do it means that you have

857
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,540
a fight and the rest of the company go

858
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,680
their children we're not going to listen

859
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,060
to anything they say no they don't get

860
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,440
any budget

861
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,280
um

862
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,859
so it doesn't really matter uh purple

863
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,900
team is quite interesting because as far

864
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,579
as I'm concerned purple team is that

865
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,160
whole or your red team will emulate the

866
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,540
bad guy

867
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,940
and see if the blue team picks up

868
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,099
is that what a pen test is

869
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,260
that not like part of a pen testing

870
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,359
scope anyway so is that not Red's team

871
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,760
with the sock just picking up the alerts

872
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
and if you're gonna have processes to

873
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,260
continually do it is that not continual

874
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,900
testing of your sock not really what the

875
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,200
salt should be doing anyway so fine

876
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,060
let's call this all purple in fact to be

877
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,099
honest let's mix it all up we can all be

878
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,380
bro no

879
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,160
um

880
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,440
ultimately it doesn't matter find your

881
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,420
Niche it doesn't matter what color it is

882
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,280
and it doesn't matter what you're doing

883
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,839
doesn't matter really what the team's

884
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,880
called you find what makes you

885
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,700
passionate in cyber or elsewhere but

886
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,099
then why are you here

887
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,380
and then do that and find a way to make

888
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,000
that make a difference and Define the

889
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,220
other people that can fill in the gaps

890
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,660
if I'm going to be sitting doing pen

891
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,760
test and then I probably shouldn't be in

892
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,380
charge of the sock somebody else should

893
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,720
be doing that sort of thing so you make

894
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,640
the team up and we all make a lovely

895
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,160
rainbow and it's lovely

896
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,160
right

897
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,740
Rifts

898
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,959
your name's Elizabeth and uh

899
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,220
oh

900
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,060
Miss clip

901
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,839
some of the best sock analysts I have

902
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,960
worked with stroke trained stroke hired

903
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,940
uh

904
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,560
we're not

905
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,780
straight out of uni

906
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,359
and or on a degree or anything like that

907
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
there are people that changed

908
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,000
Med career

909
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,460
and that doesn't mean that you don't get

910
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,099
good sock analysts straight out of uni

911
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,960
but you'd need different people with

912
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,780
different experiences to to complement

913
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,640
if you're the only soccer analyst fine

914
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,780
you know you're gonna have to pick one

915
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,359
but ultimately

916
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,359
if all you can do is regurgitate what a

917
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,820
lecturer told you last week

918
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,380
no I need something to do critical

919
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,940
thinking and can look at things and

920
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,800
understand and say that doesn't feel

921
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,099
right uh and you get more of that from

922
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,260
experience whether it be technical life

923
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,380
experience or whatever yes but also you

924
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,940
also need to have all that background

925
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,240
and all the kind of if you're not at Uni

926
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,380
learning the OSI model of networking

927
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,480
which has slipped through most added but

928
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,280
I've had a Mexican teacher that taught

929
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,780
me networking couldn't understand the

930
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,300
word he said all the time I'm selling I

931
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,700
read the book just passed

932
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,540
um

933
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,920
But ultimately

934
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,140
Tennessee is probably that that and not

935
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,420
not accepting the fact that I've seen

936
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,859
the same thing five times and I'm just

937
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,720
gonna do the same thing five times so

938
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,760
step outside and going hey that seems

939
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
better why am I doing this

940
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,619
uh and it's built a turn around to the

941
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,780
person next to you and say I don't know

942
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,339
and equally

943
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,079
when the person next he turns and says

944
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,640
they don't know to be able to help that

945
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,250
person so a good team player

946
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,560
[Music]

947
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,420
obviously there's like running joke in

948
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,680
cyber that we're all looking for the

949
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,940
seven years experience and the

950
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,920
technology that came out last year

951
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,200
um

952
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,480
entry-level graduate uh post uh must

953
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,500
have a cisp all those jokes you know

954
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,520
they're all like you know the the

955
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,880
mutually exclusive uh requirements on

956
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,619
the jobs pick I mean how does that work

957
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,160
but ultimately yeah uh when I'm looking

958
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,920
for a salt analysts I have hired soccer

959
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,260
analysts not on what they know

960
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,400
technically

961
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,099
but on what kind of person they are

962
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,800
whether I think they care

963
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,520
uh whether I think they'll give up at

964
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,900
the at the first one whether they're

965
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,640
willing to accept

966
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,800
the easy answer I mean I think one of

967
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,740
the slides of my talks earlier said that

968
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,980
one in three stock analysts admitted to

969
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,440
ignoring alerts

970
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,380
I'm gonna hire the tour of the three uh

971
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,240
please because you know but I mean

972
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,920
ultimately if you're getting so many

973
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,079
alerts in a sock

974
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,180
that you are getting to the point where

975
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,619
you're like yeah I've seen that before I

976
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:41,820
don't care I don't care I don't care I

977
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,780
don't care

978
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,540
we failed you're building the sock more

979
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,000
than you're failing us as a silk analyst

980
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,859
but as a soccer analyst and you just

981
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,680
take your hand up and go hey hang on

982
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,359
we're getting the same flow the same

983
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:55,980
stuff over and over again and it's all

984
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,079
answer is always X so why does it come

985
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:58,859
in

986
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,800
so tenacity caring those are the things

987
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,540
that are the most important

988
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,900
yes you must understand a bit of

989
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,160
Technology

990
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,220
but a lot of the technical stuff I can

991
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,060
teach you

992
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,740
and to be honest a lot of the technical

993
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,619
stuff is probably that you learned in

994
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,240
uni might be out of date by the time you

995
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,920
get to a stock analyst job five years

996
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,320
down the line because technology moves

997
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,740
and changes so the ability to

998
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,180
want to learn to pick up the next new

999
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,160
thing to to not

1000
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,400
run away from a challenge that's what

1001
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,320
makes a good soccer analyst

1002
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,160
uh something gives a so

1003
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,540
which is why Elizabeth is the best

1004
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,440
soccer analyst in the world

1005
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:54,780
also I I really like people who can walk

1006
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,079
numbers

1007
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,160
oh oh right okay this one

1008
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,480
it's letting me know what the answer is

1009
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,200
before I click on it

1010
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,720
it really depends uh so bizarrely you

1011
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,359
can look at any two uh instant response

1012
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,060
tools best one but in case maybe

1013
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,579
maybe it really depends on what you need

1014
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,660
to be doing

1015
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,359
best tool is you

1016
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,680
your brain

1017
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,400
your tenacity your caring uh

1018
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,339
bizarrely Communications tools uh

1019
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,320
anybody that disputes that communication

1020
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,300
tools are really important in cyborg

1021
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,760
explain to me teams

1022
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
okay

1023
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,000
um I like lying uh but and as much as

1024
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,920
I'm a fan of body ports and deception

1025
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,079
technology simply because I can put them

1026
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,579
in anywhere

1027
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,160
and I get

1028
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,960
once you get rid of your volume scans

1029
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,640
and stuff hitting them if they go off

1030
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,680
it's a problem straight away there's no

1031
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,619
edit maybe do we need to investigate you

1032
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,540
literally go

1033
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,040
this is a problem we need to go to

1034
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,859
immediately address it so I feel like

1035
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,619
that for me when I'm the blue team and

1036
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,060
I'm really worried about lots of alerts

1037
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,500
I've got thousands of systems coming

1038
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,300
into me in logs and people doing crazy

1039
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,319
stuff and VPN and into Netflix so in the

1040
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,700
US so you can watch something on Netflix

1041
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,440
that isn't in the UK and they do it on

1042
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,440
their corporate laptop all that nonsense

1043
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,420
you get lots of noise from security

1044
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,060
tools but for me when you stick in a

1045
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,319
canary or a Harry Potter or something

1046
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,339
like that and you can figure it right

1047
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,619
once you've got it in it's like done

1048
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,440
and you go with that thing ever sings

1049
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,500
you go your bed and you deal with it so

1050
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,200
for me that sort of

1051
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,380
High Dependable tool is super useful

1052
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,599
from usability But ultimately yeah like

1053
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,240
the comms uh

1054
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
super important because you can't

1055
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,359
communicate with people then there's no

1056
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,579
point in you existing

1057
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,160
so yeah so it's it's the ones that you

1058
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,900
don't think but you have my best cyber

1059
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,859
tool

1060
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,900
currently thinks canaries because I just

1061
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,640
love how simple and easy it is for me to

1062
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,619
deal with them uh uh my most important

1063
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,720
two can we tools are actually our own

1064
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,940
communication uh

1065
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,800
which makes you feel really dirty and

1066
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,300
sad that it seems

1067
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,280
um

1068
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,760
but ultimately uh every every specialty

1069
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,880
every color uh every person will have

1070
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,599
their own

1071
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,460
favorites for the job that they do day

1072
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,040
to day uh what you want to do is find

1073
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,720
yourself a mentor that's really good at

1074
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,760
whatever you want to be in and say what

1075
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,500
do you use explain to me why you like it

1076
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,819
and they make up your own minds don't

1077
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,880
carbon copy go what are you using why

1078
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,260
are you using it why do you like that

1079
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,760
better than the other stuff so you can

1080
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,319
actually understand the ins and the outs

1081
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,560
of the tool and actually go ah this

1082
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,900
makes sense and oh I didn't know it

1083
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,339
could do that or I didn't know I'd ever

1084
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,859
need to worry about that scenario

1085
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,180
but know that I know I need to worry

1086
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,800
about that scenario yeah that tool makes

1087
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,619
sense so you can learn a lot from the

1088
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,780
day job by looking at the tools that

1089
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,880
people are actually using and if they go

1090
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,640
I hate this

1091
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,420
you need to come in somebody getting

1092
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,500
your tools

1093
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,359
um but yeah so yeah that's my my

1094
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,319
favorite tool is you

1095
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,740
are we running numbers probably

1096
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,279
oh nice

1097
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,400
uh

1098
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,000
uh so

1099
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,980
doing stuff in the community doing stuff

1100
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,079
like this talk uh a Discord servers all

1101
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,420
these sorts of things uh

1102
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,819
they are not just for going out and

1103
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,760
getting drunk in fact at certain other

1104
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,040
university event I may have gone up to a

1105
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,660
table of students and said you're a

1106
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,859
bunch of idiots and they'll look to me

1107
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,000
with a blankly

1108
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,220
some of them in this room possibly yeah

1109
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,819
yeah yeah

1110
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,859
can you remember why I said you're an

1111
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,720
idiot

1112
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,540
yeah okay sure enough uh so I went up to

1113
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,740
them and said you're a bunch of idiots

1114
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,339
because at the table next to you are a

1115
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,579
whole bunch of people that run cyber

1116
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,160
teams and uh

1117
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
like let's say there was like

1118
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,900
yeah you had an mssp

1119
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,140
hiring manager there an mssp engineer

1120
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,180
there was a

1121
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,339
uni stop I mean there was a whole bunch

1122
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,440
of people there that basically are

1123
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,960
saying on higher you guys are sitting in

1124
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,240
the same drunken table that you sit in

1125
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,880
every single night when you should be

1126
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,760
studying or doing something proper

1127
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,599
um

1128
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,000
and yet the people that could hire you

1129
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,700
tomorrow are sitting at the next table

1130
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,520
looking at you going hmm

1131
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,380
and I don't mind that you're drunk what

1132
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,700
I want you to do is come and talk to me

1133
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,680
and say hey what do you do and that's

1134
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,780
what you need to do you need to get out

1135
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,339
in the communities and then not just sit

1136
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,839
at the same table the same people but

1137
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,640
starting to say hey who are you and what

1138
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,579
do you do and ask and care and then you

1139
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,020
never know that person might give you

1140
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,960
your job in at the end of your degree at

1141
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,060
the next job or the next job after that

1142
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,619
ultimately

1143
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:16,079
in communities we can do lots of good uh

1144
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,579
one of the easiest things for a

1145
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:20,700
community to is help people get into the

1146
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,819
their careers and help them stay sane in

1147
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,440
their careers which is also reasonably

1148
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,579
important

1149
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,359
um

1150
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,700
but yeah you need to sit there and look

1151
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,220
and go is there somebody in this room

1152
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,140
that I don't know who they are and then

1153
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,599
go and find out who they are not right

1154
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:37,740
now listen to the rest of the top but

1155
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,480
maybe do it afterwards

1156
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,980
But ultimately

1157
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,400
get out there do good in communities and

1158
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,140
you'll find a job opportunities come

1159
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,319
along uh I have hired

1160
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,960
one

1161
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,420
who is one person in this room purely

1162
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,520
from the fact that I met them through a

1163
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,579
community event not because

1164
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,540
and that was a yeah one

1165
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,900
the wrestling mirror no because then we

1166
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,200
yeah you did you met bill at an event so

1167
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,640
but I was talking about me this is about

1168
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,480
me it's my talk

1169
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,099
my talk do you want to come into the

1170
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,280
talk

1171
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,940
this is now Elizabeth's talk everyone

1172
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,579
I'm going home

1173
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:26,040
but yeah make sure you look around and

1174
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,780
go I don't know you

1175
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,420
um so uh

1176
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,579
there was a uh

1177
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,980
uh in fact when I this this did this

1178
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,280
talk for the very first time uh there

1179
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,960
was a bit about you know making sure

1180
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,940
that you've got diversity and stuff

1181
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,560
around your Workforce and one of the

1182
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,819
guys at the end of the government yeah

1183
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,859
yeah I made the my own company and I

1184
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,480
have a real problem with diversity I can

1185
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,280
completely understand because like what

1186
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,619
I did is I like I made my company and

1187
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,140
then I hired all my mates to come and

1188
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,640
work with me and everything but now we

1189
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,900
realize that you know our company made

1190
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,780
up of middle-aged white guys you're like

1191
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,640
why are all your friends middle-aged

1192
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,520
white guys of course you can't see that

1193
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,900
when you're standing in front of the guy

1194
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,579
because like it was really normally he

1195
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,760
was a sponsor as well so yeah but um it

1196
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,740
became a it's a thing where you sit and

1197
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,619
going if all your friends look and think

1198
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,660
exactly like you nobody's ever going to

1199
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,099
tell you that you're wrong

1200
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,260
and that's important in life

1201
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,000
I've heard

1202
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,060
um

1203
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,800
But ultimately make sure that like

1204
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,079
people that don't think exactly the same

1205
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,400
way as you will bring you another

1206
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,920
context another point of view and some

1207
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,119
things that's a difference between the

1208
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,280
bad guy when and the good guys lose it

1209
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,119
four

1210
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,619
uh

1211
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,599
okay

1212
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,319
uh

1213
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,359
I see ah there's a little lesson to

1214
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,579
myself talk about this or I'll be on the

1215
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,400
ID cyber webcast like the other day and

1216
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,000
but yeah two days ago um

1217
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,700
uh funny instant response story uh

1218
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,220
that leads to diversity thinking

1219
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,900
trusting and a whole bunch of other

1220
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,220
weird and wonderful things but

1221
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,300
ultimately

1222
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,859
um

1223
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,619
two weeks into the job

1224
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,440
I'm working an incident uh

1225
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,980
and it's a business email compromise uh

1226
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,839
and it's not just one account so you're

1227
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,859
immediately starting to worry about

1228
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,200
admins and stuff like that gonna oh like

1229
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,300
this thing but we've got loads of loads

1230
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,920
of foreign logins you speak to the

1231
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,260
client and say you have

1232
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,680
people working in Nigeria all right no

1233
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,839
all right okay and what about Russia

1234
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,000
China no no everybody's UK based right

1235
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,680
right so what you're telling me is that

1236
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,559
anybody logs in successfully outside of

1237
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:50,940
the UK

1238
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,520
is probably compromising yeah so okay

1239
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,160
that's a good place to start since we

1240
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,480
don't have much of the real logs but

1241
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,859
we've got that stuff so let's go get

1242
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,960
that and so we went through and so we

1243
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,540
prioritized all the uh foreign logins

1244
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,619
and went right okay that person's

1245
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:06,300
compromised when did they get comprised

1246
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,619
blah blah blah try and check out the way

1247
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:09,420
back through it's a very long and

1248
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,920
horrible incident

1249
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,079
mostly because

1250
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:15,059
they didn't really have any good logging

1251
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:16,680
and that's always a crap one when you

1252
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,059
get pulled into an incident and you go

1253
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:21,420
they go hey how do we get hacked

1254
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,079
no idea your logs go back 15 minutes uh

1255
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,880
so I can tell you it wasn't in the last

1256
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,400
15 minutes

1257
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,140
but uh

1258
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,020
while we're going through all these uh I

1259
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm correlating names with people that

1260
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,280
we kind of know as VIPs and stuff like

1261
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,960
that and of the company

1262
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,819
and I come across the director's name

1263
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,380
you're like oh crap

1264
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,540
so right okay uh

1265
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,940
let's put that person up to the top of

1266
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,859
the list uh to get a phone call to get

1267
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,440
the whole You've Been breached we need

1268
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,359
to have a we talk about

1269
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,000
or you're saying I email I uncheck all

1270
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,500
that sort of stuff and make sure that

1271
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,119
everything in your account is what you

1272
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,040
think it is and there's an intensive you

1273
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,020
might have done said whatever via office

1274
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,900
365. you know this is an uncomfortable

1275
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,400
conversation

1276
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,460
so the MD of the company actually made

1277
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,200
phone call and said hey if you're such a

1278
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,480
not you're working on your incident

1279
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,140
unfortunately your account's been

1280
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,460
breached because you've been logged in

1281
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,380
from outside the UK which you say yeah

1282
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,300
definitely not been outside the UK right

1283
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
okay

1284
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,740
this is not fun uh

1285
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,599
and then I'm sitting looking at it going

1286
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,599
this is a little bit weird

1287
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,319
because all my other nefarious slogans

1288
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:38,540
are Nigeria's China's Russia's

1289
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:41,579
Spain which seemed to be a thing at the

1290
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:43,319
time

1291
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,140
and this one was Ireland

1292
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,460
but it's actually the UK officially

1293
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,319
um

1294
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,420
and he's definitely not been in Ireland

1295
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,400
so

1296
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
it's can be attributed to them

1297
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,460
so he's been breached doesn't he

1298
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,280
no it doesn't feel right so you go and

1299
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,900
look up the IP address it was already

1300
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,540
done and we know which ISP owns it we

1301
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,680
look at it going

1302
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,180
nothing there

1303
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,859
Google the ISP and start looking at

1304
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,800
their news records which for an ISP

1305
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,140
doesn't actually have that many but okay

1306
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,540
and it turns out

1307
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,300
by looking at that I then dropped what

1308
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,740
I'm doing run across to the phone call

1309
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,920
with the with this direct angle

1310
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,359
can you ask him what he drives

1311
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,160
which of course is a bit of a bizarre I

1312
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,660
mean I know you guys are still learning

1313
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,160
in uni and stuff like that but normally

1314
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,099
there isn't a module that says if the

1315
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,599
person drives this they're going to get

1316
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,700
hacked uh

1317
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,280
so I'm like this and meanwhile AMD the

1318
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,660
company's looking at me as if I've grown

1319
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,880
another head going you've been here two

1320
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,020
weeks

1321
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,760
so like your second incident you've

1322
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,440
worked on us and you're like you're

1323
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,780
asking me to ask the director of this

1324
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,819
company what he drives

1325
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,540
please

1326
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,140
um

1327
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,599
does he die of an Audi and he's like

1328
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,460
can I ask you do you drive around yes

1329
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,780
he's not been hacked

1330
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,900
uh when you Google enough of the ISP you

1331
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,700
find out like two years before they've

1332
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,400
been awarded the Audi autopilot contract

1333
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,200
and when you look at the autopilot you

1334
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,960
go of course that's the Wi-Fi in

1335
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,140
high-end Audis so basically every time

1336
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,319
you make a Wi-Fi connection to your car

1337
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,700
for the internet

1338
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,920
it pops out and I don't

1339
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
and it was quite legitimately driving

1340
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,660
this car around the UK meanwhile all

1341
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,599
this traffic was coming out of Ireland

1342
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:41,880
uh which is

1343
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,740
an interesting way to turn and say hey

1344
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,960
you're not being hacked it's because you

1345
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,640
drive an Audi that you've come up in my

1346
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,599
right

1347
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,280
but

1348
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,900
it's because it didn't feel right

1349
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,579
because all the other ones you could

1350
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,500
kind of see random times there were

1351
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,599
roughly local time zones all these sorts

1352
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,400
of things and you can see that they're

1353
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,619
all you don't want to stereotype things

1354
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,180
but generally stuff coming out of Russia

1355
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,300
Nigeria and China oh great

1356
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,200
um

1357
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,900
let's face it I like

1358
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,280
somebody might want to stand up and

1359
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,260
start shouting about ipgo location and

1360
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,559
how inaccurate it is but when you look

1361
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,359
at you go hang on this just doesn't feel

1362
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,700
right and so you keep poking it which is

1363
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,020
why a robot's not going to come along

1364
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,640
and replace your job anytime soon

1365
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,140
because

1366
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,000
just something that doesn't feel right

1367
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,880
in your water it's not easy to code into

1368
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,540
robots yet it says hopefully but

1369
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,940
ultimately yeah so yeah funny instant

1370
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,680
response story is that when you look at

1371
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,059
it and you just keep poking It Go that

1372
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,359
doesn't feel right keep poking it until

1373
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:44,280
you get an answer

1374
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,380
or you've run out of billable hours and

1375
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,099
then move on

1376
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,760
are we running out because we're running

1377
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,079
out of time anyway

1378
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,040
so uh

1379
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,559
oh I don't make it like me uh that's

1380
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,960
that's that's nice that's nice stop

1381
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,839
saying no to them uh it's easy

1382
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,119
when you say no to people a lot they

1383
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,619
don't like you uh so uh and this goes

1384
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,119
for it doesn't it does this for it

1385
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,339
support it does it for like cyber as

1386
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:19,680
well security has a really bad

1387
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,780
reputation for saying no you can't do

1388
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,000
that because it's not secure

1389
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,300
thanks uh

1390
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,880
always ask if somebody's asking you

1391
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,619
something really weird like hiya can I

1392
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,240
make it any any ruler can I put this

1393
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,579
3389 the old rule open to the internet

1394
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:36,660
please

1395
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,920
rather than saying no you're an idiot or

1396
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,079
I have had an analyst

1397
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,420
who's not here but became a sock manager

1398
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,099
so hey feel free to figure that one out

1399
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,380
essentially standing on his chair saying

1400
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,380
I can't believe they did this and you're

1401
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,240
like

1402
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,700
they did what it's 3389 opens Internet

1403
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,220
it's like that I.T guy was just trying

1404
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,780
to make something work the figure that

1405
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,220
might be something to do with the

1406
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,260
firewalls you put in any any rule in it

1407
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,000
started working the day I've went yeah

1408
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,099
brilliant and then meanwhile the

1409
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,260
the PA to the head of the company

1410
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,640
suddenly screams because the printer

1411
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,079
isn't it working so they run off and fix

1412
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,400
that he never came back and fixed any

1413
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,460
any rule that's an easy mistake to make

1414
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,920
so don't go on a high horse and say no

1415
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,440
no no you're wrong you're stupid no no

1416
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,380
that doesn't get you anywhere uh what

1417
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,579
you always want to do is if somebody

1418
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:27,960
comes up to you and says hey we would

1419
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,579
quite like to implement this and it's

1420
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,859
obviously ludicrous

1421
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,240
so I'm gonna say what are you trying to

1422
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,500
achieve

1423
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,240
because you may be able to help them and

1424
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,380
then you get a reputation for being

1425
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,819
helpful and believe it or not when

1426
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,140
you've got a tip repetition for being

1427
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,940
helpful people stop putting in Shadow

1428
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,220
I.T you're trying to get around your

1429
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,260
security controls because they know that

1430
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,700
they can come to you and say hey we'd

1431
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,020
quite like to do this and maybe a wee

1432
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,579
bit off the wall you go actually there's

1433
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:51,960
no problem with that that's fine or hey

1434
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,960
if we do it this way it'll be fine so uh

1435
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,260
don't say no to people instead ask what

1436
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,599
they're trying to achieve uh the other

1437
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:03,780
top tip for on a similar one is never

1438
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,619
mess with receptionist janitors uh

1439
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,000
uh

1440
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,920
it's just stupid it's just don't do it

1441
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,740
or an airline Airline staff and Gates

1442
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,599
don't mess up and witness at Birmingham

1443
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,220
Airport the other day did not what go

1444
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,660
well for the person that was unhappy

1445
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,000
about the queue uh funny that isn't it

1446
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,059
so yeah right I think

1447
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,520
that is a substantially out of time but

1448
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,900
we got through most of them which is

1449
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,119
quite impressive uh we didn't meet the

1450
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:33,119
magic trick work uh they're shot nearly

1451
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,040
worked but not quite but I didn't get

1452
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,319
shot in the face so thanks man

1453
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:37,920
um

1454
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,299
so

1455
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:42,599
that kind of just leads me to

1456
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,180
the end which is keep asking questions

1457
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,740
so if you have questions about anything

1458
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,720
that was on there feel free to ask me or

1459
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,919
Elizabeth because she knows better

1460
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,160
keep learning never let yourself stop

1461
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,720
always it doesn't have to be something

1462
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,579
technical just learn something new every

1463
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,020
day if you can it's always a good thing

1464
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,319
to be and apart from that if you I am

1465
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,119
still on Twitter although

1466
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:07,980
not sure how long any of us will still

1467
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,140
be on Twitter but

1468
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,780
you will be able to find me at

1469
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,940
