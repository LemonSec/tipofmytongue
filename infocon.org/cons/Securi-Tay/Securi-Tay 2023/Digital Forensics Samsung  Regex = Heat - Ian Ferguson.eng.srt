1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,220
okay good morning ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,280
how are you out there

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,920
uh are you having fun yet

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,460
oh you are oh I'll go away then

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,780
um

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,960
it is a pleasure and a privilege to be

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,720
standing in front of you once again uh

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,359
at security

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,400
some of you will know if you are kind of

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,359
old security hands that what happens is

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,120
about two weeks before security

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,340
some speaker drops out

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,120
the committee go panic and I get an

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,620
email saying would you mind just

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,420
presenting something for an hour all

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,000
right okay so so I I'm Chief Deputy

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Underdog Reserve emergency speaker I

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,340
think it's my official title as far as

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,079
uh security goals so so here I am to uh

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,300
to try and entertain you I have to say

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,579
this is a completely novel experience

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,500
standing here at 11 o'clock in the

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,019
morning because I always get put on the

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,339
four o'clock slot in the afternoon

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,619
because I'm the emergency Reserve guy

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,799
and everybody just wants to go to a pub

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,659
so I've actually got a genuine chance to

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,340
pull the ass off you for an hour this

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,439
morning while while there's some intense

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,680
some some attention why not

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
um for those of you who don't know me my

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
name is Ian Ferguson I'm actually one of

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,659
the staffers here at Abate uh

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,220
or a life

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,619
resident or a life sentence or something

36
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,220
I've been here for nearly 13 years now

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,040
would you believe uh I've also been

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
teaching digital forensics since I think

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,500
about 2004 and had the awful experience

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,600
in the digital forensics class this year

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
of realizing that some of the slides in

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
my deck were older than the people I was

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,399
talking to uh which kind of terrified me

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,000
but there we go

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
shall we do some technical stuff shall

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,299
we talk uh technology and some

47
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,100
interesting things I would like to talk

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,240
to you

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640
um

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,380
essentially about a real digital

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,419
forensics case that they got involved in

52
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,819
a couple of years ago I teach digital

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,500
forensics here for folks who don't know

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
me uh I occasionally get to do real

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,180
casework both on the defense side and

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,800
occasionally

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
um police Scotland come along and knock

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,459
on the door and say could you help out

59
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,599
with something this was one of those

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,060
occasions it's never made it into any of

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,800
my official teachings I thought yeah why

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
not why not talk about it today and see

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,520
if we can interest people in this so the

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,459
title is Samsung Plus regex

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,738
what you're about to see is the story

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Samsung mobile phone

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,620
so if you wanted something to take away

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,720
from here uh yeah we'll do the takeaway

69
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,040
we'll do the summary right at the

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,180
beginning

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,440
um what we did was we managed to

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
identify a new source of interesting

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,700
information

74
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,879
interesting on on Android mobile phones

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,379
in particular a file called ssrm

76
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,700
underscoreheating.log which doesn't

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,440
sound terribly exciting when you say it

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,540
like that but you'll see it actually had

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,940
quite profound consequences for the case

80
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,220
that I was involved with

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,959
basically what we're going to talk about

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,260
is the fact that I needed to search

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
a great big

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,780
forensic image from a mobile phone for

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,099
timestamps

86
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,900
sounds good

87
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,060
routine mundane the kind of thing that I

88
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,760
do teach in cmp209

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,319
um Turned out it wasn't quite as easy as

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,580
you might have thought and we had to do

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,340
some jiggering pokery to make it work in

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,480
particular

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,200
no that's that's clay post uh let's get

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,940
this technology here

95
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,920
um I had to develop a new version of

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,879
grep

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,620
to even heard of uh called by grab

98
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,019
to work with this ordinary wouldn't cut

99
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,239
it it's quite I think it's quite

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,519
interesting why that had to be done and

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,379
how it was done

102
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,680
um we then looked at turning a one-off

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
investigation and a one-off find of

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,060
something into a proper digital

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,519
forensics methodology and to see why

106
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,459
that might be an interesting task

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,199
um one of the things we were concerned

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
with is how widely it was applicable and

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,680
we'll talk a little bit about that as

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,780
well so that's that's the road map for

111
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,460
the next

112
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,560
hour or so

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,660
um some kudos to other people I'm glad

114
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,340
to say that Ethan is back with us this

115
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,100
morning he's my partner in crime

116
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,740
literally uh

117
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
that's a good joke I remember to put

118
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,199
that one in again

119
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,600
was a student that he had working for us

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,940
over the summer on this one plane and

121
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,919
also Lindsay without who's valuable

122
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,600
input and knowledge we wouldn't have got

123
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,340
as far as we did so well done to them

124
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,360
thank you

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
okay motivation Story Time two thousand

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,139
notes yes 20 2019 is it really that long

127
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:04,979
ago

128
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,740
uh Ordinary Day in the office sitting

129
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,960
upstairs get a phone call from reception

130
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,880
at the front desk

131
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,680
um police Scotland are here to see you

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
damn they finally caught me

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,220
um

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
went down

135
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,699
uh a fella

136
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,160
that I know DCI Martin do we have any

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,979
police Scotland folk in this morning

138
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,620
no say what I like about it good

139
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,820
so basically

140
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,740
um we've got this case that we're

141
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,539
working on it's a rape case and

142
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,740
the defendants defense effectively is

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,660
that you couldn't have been raping

144
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,000
somebody of that time because that

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
somebody was actually playing a game on

146
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,258
their mobile phone that was the defense

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,699
all right so it will actually boiled

148
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,100
down to was could we establish

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,960
whether this particular game thing

150
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,919
called toy blast

151
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,139
um or announcement called Peak games had

152
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,940
it been played on a particular mobile

153
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,940
phone I absolute period

154
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,120
if it had been you had an alibi if it

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,979
hadn't been then it wasn't looking too

156
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,020
good for it

157
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,900
now interestingly the victim

158
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,139
actually volunteered a mobile phone

159
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,960
so you may examine that and they're

160
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,759
given it to this was the folks alone

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,039
here is Dundee along Bell Street police

162
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,500
station just along the street there uh

163
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,020
they've taken the phone and they've done

164
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,819
a kind of full forensic number on it so

165
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,340
that they'd imaged it of course they had

166
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,020
the passcode so there was nothing

167
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,819
particularly exciting about the Imaging

168
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,220
bit of this of you know being encrypted

169
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,539
or any of that kind of just so there's

170
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,699
no there's no interesting stories about

171
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,639
cracking encryption with PlayStation

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
threes or anything like that this one

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,240
um

174
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,860
they've got a hold of an image of this

175
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,539
thing and they'd run it through all of

176
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,800
the current generation of digital

177
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
forensics tools if you're in this game

178
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
you will know x-ray you'll know

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,780
celebrate you may have heard a gray key

180
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,419
in this kind of thing uh they'd run it

181
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:10,560
through that and it could produce

182
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,620
absolutely nothing about said mobile

183
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,319
phone about this particular game or

184
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,060
about this particular time

185
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,699
so they sent it down to the folks in

186
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,300
Edinburgh uh the top secret digital

187
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,759
forensics facility just outside the

188
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,440
airport

189
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,360
um

190
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,220
with a burger van outside

191
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,080
we see all the coppers queuing up at

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,520
lunchtime so you know exactly which

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,539
building is the top secret facility uh

194
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,520
they couldn't do anything on it they

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
sent it down to the Metropolitan Police

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,099
in London could they dig any evidence

197
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,319
out of this phone that game had been

198
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,440
played during the actual 20 minutes that

199
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,180
were relevant to the case

200
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,560
and it came back nothing can't do it

201
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,720
[Music]

202
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
um

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,340
I think I'm pleased to be kind of the

204
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,360
Third

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,880
person in the queue what they call so

206
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
your person of Last Resort

207
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,240
they can't do anything they give it to

208
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,039
Fergie see if he can have a go at it

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,419
right okay

210
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,840
so they gave us a 32 gigabyte forensic

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
image of the phone an entire storage of

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,819
the phone they gave us some details of

213
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,979
the time period of Interest

214
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,199
I gave us

215
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,560
this shot

216
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,279
your phone is absolutely full of

217
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,899
screenshots where I've accidentally

218
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,458
pulled out of my pocket and gone click

219
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,099
and screenshot the damn thing they found

220
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,860
an accidental screenshot of round about

221
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,320
the right period showing a picture of

222
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,839
this game all right okay that's that's

223
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,399
something to go on

224
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,220
so there's quite a lot riding on this

225
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,140
um but it was very much well if you can

226
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,459
find something you can if you can't

227
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,080
don't worry too much about it you know

228
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,339
we tried and you are the last

229
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,459
result so I had a go and we tried

230
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,779
various things we thought well there's

231
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,060
be some Network logs on the device it's

232
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,580
a game it's bound to be shipping high

233
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,740
scores back to the Mothership somewhere

234
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,140
can we see any evidence that it's done

235
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,839
that is there a log file somewhere which

236
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,420
tells us this phone's been communicating

237
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,640
nope

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,120
um all right let's get

239
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,519
the boys at Bell Street to get in touch

240
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,500
with the ISP and I can't honestly

241
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,080
remember whether it was O2 who the hell

242
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,820
it was virgin

243
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,860
have you got the logs for that film is

244
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,899
there any evidence of you know what was

245
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,420
being sent over the network on that

246
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,180
phone at that particular time

247
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
came back black can't remember whether

248
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,600
it was we didn't we don't have any logs

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,980
or there was nothing for that time but

250
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,399
we came back

251
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,380
all right getting a bit desperate we

252
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,480
know who the game maker is let's

253
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,279
footprint them so we did the full

254
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,660
footprinting number trying to find a

255
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,100
little bit about them who they are where

256
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,899
they are turns out they're in Turkey I

257
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,540
think uh let's get in touch with them

258
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,700
have you got anything is there anything

259
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,220
in your system logs which will tell us

260
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,019
what that phone was doing at that time

261
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,380
no reply nothing said no

262
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
I think somebody did try and get Turkish

263
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,640
police to go and knock on their door I

264
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,959
don't think that ever happened whatever

265
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,680
um

266
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,720
all right we know the name of the game

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
we know a little bit about making games

268
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,279
around here at upper teeth

269
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,140
allegedly

270
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,779
incidentally we're all in the wrong game

271
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,360
by the way we shouldn't be we should

272
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,800
have all gone

273
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
on computer games instead of computer

274
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,180
security when we looked into this bloody

275
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,080
game

276
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,180
saw what people were paying for for a

277
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,640
few fancy graphics and some crap code

278
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,380
you know people are being paid good

279
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,240
money to churn this stuff up

280
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,839
awful uh basically we tried to reverse

281
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,279
engineer the game could we figure out

282
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,079
anything going on that this stage was

283
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,779
starting getting suspicious this game

284
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,700
actually isn't communicating with

285
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,459
anything at all it's a standalone game

286
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,440
on a phone there is no communication

287
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
there's nothing in the log there's

288
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,140
nothing

289
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,940
perfect

290
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,079
assumption

291
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,240
thing connected back to the Mothership

292
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,620
and we could find something that way

293
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,560
false as far as I know I didn't kind of

294
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,620
go ahead and prove that but uh

295
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,680
but without working the Assumption

296
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,480
disprove what else are we going to do

297
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,640
all right

298
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,740
and this is kind of the point of the

299
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,760
talk

300
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,940
digital forensics isn't just about you

301
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
use pressing the buttons and seeing the

302
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,660
pretty stuff that comes back if you

303
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,180
can't find was the game being played at

304
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,440
that time

305
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,779
try asking a different question

306
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,540
at time was the game being played now

307
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,200
that sounds silly and trite I know but I

308
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,760
can actually remember sitting there and

309
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,260
kind of the moment that my thought

310
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,000
flipped over

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,160
right stop looking at it that way look

312
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,600
at it the other way

313
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,480
can you find anything at all on the

314
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,820
phone which tells you what was going on

315
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,279
at that time period

316
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,360
oh

317
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
how would I do that well we've got all

318
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,740
of this stuff back from

319
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,560
the other forensic tools in Dunham

320
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,600
they're finding nothing relevant

321
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,160
what would happen

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,779
if I search the entire binary image for

323
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,459
timestamps relevant to the 20 minutes

324
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,399
where this crime is alleged to have

325
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,540
taken place one point how can I do that

326
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,120
well we could we can come up with time

327
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
pretty easy we know what it looks like

328
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,740
how do you actually search for that one

329
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,180
of these forensic tools have pulled it

330
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,820
out what are we going to do

331
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,860
in other words how do you search for

332
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,200
time steps at this point

333
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,940
again this is kind of one of the point

334
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,380
of the talks

335
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,000
you know you really do need to know the

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,220
fundamentals of what's going on in a

337
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
system

338
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,540
what do time stamps look like well

339
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,740
actually there's lots of different

340
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,139
possible formats of time stamps and we

341
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,700
looked at several

342
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,940
um SQL light as I'm sure you know is a

343
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,220
database which is widely used by Android

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,700
and in fact by Apple iOS as well

345
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,459
what would a time stamp in those periods

346
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,360
look like in SQL live format text it's

347
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
actually moderately easy to search for

348
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,920
not all programs

349
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,399
in fact

350
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
someone is breaking it why is it always

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,240
me whenever I stand

352
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,279
I'm not actually I don't I don't think

353
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,079
I've actually spoken in this lecture set

354
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,399
for about three years because

355
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,860
uh so it's a bit weird being back every

356
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,240
time I'm in

357
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,839
um

358
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,320
you will know that time steps are often

359
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,079
stored just as a great big integer and

360
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,420
that integer is often the number of

361
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,060
seconds since the 1st of January 1970 or

362
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,680
the number of milliseconds since the

363
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
first of January 1970

364
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,660
so the Unix epoch oh my God I'm older

365
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,120
than the unixie park

366
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,820
you can't measure me with use

367
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
um

368
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,260
there are some variations to that you

369
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,660
don't know whether the time stamp is

370
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,339
going to represent

371
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,220
UTC universal time code Greenwich Mean

372
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,839
Time

373
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,800
um

374
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,260
could have been British summer time was

375
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,959
it well not in December so that made

376
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,540
that one a little bit easier uh

377
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,459
was it actually even in local time was

378
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,500
it some other time zone

379
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,720
all right so this is starting to get a

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,760
little bit complicated what might that

381
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,360
time stamp actually look like

382
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,579
well I'm going to search using grip if I

383
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,139
want to specify how to find anything on

384
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,820
the computer I'm probably going to use a

385
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,680
regular expression

386
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,920
all right what does 10 am on a

387
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,260
particular day in question look like

388
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,040
well if it was a local time then it

389
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,279
looks a lot like that in milliseconds if

390
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,699
it's GMT it's an hour earlier it looks a

391
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,260
lot it's a number

392
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,459
okay

393
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,320
uh

394
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,899
all right well that's just an integer

395
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,079
remember CMP 101 some of you from years

396
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
ago uh data representation and all of

397
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,760
that jazz well let's try and represent

398
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,620
that as hex

399
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,040
turns out that it comes out like that

400
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,139
it's a hexadecimal

401
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,579
okay

402
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,160
um we knew that the incident I think it

403
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,440
was 10 40. let's call it 10 40 between

404
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,079
10 14 11 percent of argument we thought

405
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,519
we'd kind of

406
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,260
change the range a bit so we went for

407
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,320
anything between 10 a.m and 1 p.m and we

408
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,899
worked out what the

409
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,899
hex representation of those integers was

410
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,019
for those two times so we have bounds

411
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,760
that we're looking for right

412
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,019
hang on time steps

413
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,160
long

414
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,320
in C yes right so 64-bit integer

415
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,260
I mean had these things and actually

416
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,839
what I need to do is to ignore the least

417
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,519
significant Bank

418
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,620
and that's going to give me a time range

419
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,579
corresponding to

420
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,279
the start and the end so we're just

421
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,260
ignoring I can't remember how much of it

422
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
we ignored but depending on how many

423
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,100
bits you ignore you're kind of giving

424
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,980
yourself a different range of times that

425
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,079
you're looking for uh needs to be

426
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,839
encoded and escaped for the shell and

427
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,639
for the big rep

428
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,759
turns out we were searching for that as

429
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,440
our regular expression I think that's I

430
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,180
think that's 10 o'clock

431
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,459
well actually 10 o'clock and if you

432
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,860
remember your regular Expressions on the

433
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,579
end

434
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,860
dot means I don't care what's in there

435
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,899
so it's 10 o'clock and a bit

436
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,240
so I'm searching this whole

437
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,240
binary image for things representing the

438
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,059
time 10 o'clock in a bit to one o'clock

439
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,079
with a bit less

440
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,520
just say we're going to search 32

441
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,780
gigabyte image we've got a copy of the

442
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,359
entire memory of the phone

443
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,000
there's a problem with that and I don't

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,280
think I'd ever worked it out until I

445
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,940
came to this case

446
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,540
great

447
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,520
a friendly command line graph that we've

448
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,340
all used it was used every day is

449
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,559
profoundly

450
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,620
meant for searching things in text files

451
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,240
in other words it's meant for searching

452
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,340
for printable characters it's meant for

453
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,080
searching with things which have a

454
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,880
return on the end which say that's the

455
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,419
end of the line

456
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,340
hang on that 32 gigabyte file is

457
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,260
profoundly its binary data it doesn't

458
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,760
correspond to that

459
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,440
grip has a 2K line length limit

460
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
2048 a big surprise

461
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
I can't use gret to do this all right

462
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,640
okay that's a bit of a problem

463
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,280
also turns out there's no way of having

464
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,740
non-printable characters in The regex

465
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,660
actually I've since found out there are

466
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,940
some flames of grep do that the time

467
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,500
that we profoundly believe that we could

468
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,380
not use regex

469
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,840
with uh with non printable jars

470
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
and then the real big one is the grip

471
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,419
has been compiled this is true for

472
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,160
almost all of the versions see out there

473
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
with 32-bit file points in other words

474
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,179
the maximum size file you can search

475
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,880
with grep is four and a bit gigabytes

476
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,000
right that's just blown our approach out

477
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,980
the water we can't go grabbing for

478
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,240
timestamps

479
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,000
what do we do do we run away and cry

480
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,100
quietly in the corner

481
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,679
admit failure walk along the Bell Street

482
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,260
police station say

483
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,539
I'll ask I can do nothing

484
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,980
no

485
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,500
we are software Engineers we are hackers

486
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,660
we are head bangers we rewrote grip

487
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,360
this is the best this is the best book

488
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,580
coming to the best bit when you see how

489
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,100
long it takes to rewrite grep

490
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,539
you're either going to call me a

491
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,220
charlatan of God

492
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,559
right

493
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,000
um

494
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,640
we wrote A Thing Called well I call it

495
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,559
buy grab could be big could be biograph

496
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,880
who cares

497
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,539
um

498
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,360
I use Python I use the library called M

499
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,480
map memory management Library uh memory

500
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,980
mapping Library I'm going to tell you

501
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,860
how marvelous that is in a second uh and

502
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,140
good old regex library the standard

503
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,679
regex line python python is more modern

504
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,500
job python has 64-bit file pointers so

505
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,360
we've just blown that objection to Java

506
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,640
straight out of the water

507
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,340
we want to allow the specification of a

508
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,059
pattern as hex so I need some way of

509
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,160
processing the command line to do that

510
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,320
big deal we could write command line

511
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
processes

512
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,340
um it's available there if you wait till

513
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,140
the last slide there's a nice QR code

514
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,820
and you can go straight to the page if

515
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,919
you wish to download this pile of useful

516
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,660
code

517
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,700
um and actually

518
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
this is where you're going to cry

519
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,380
that's it give you four lines

520
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,740
seriously you can Implement grip in four

521
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,580
lines

522
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,980
yeah you can python

523
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,160
actually it's not okay there's about 12

524
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,140
lines before that just take the

525
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,120
parameters from the command line and

526
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,740
process them so that they're in a nice

527
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,220
form to use it those four lines

528
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
are the only four lines you do anything

529
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,020
useful in that program

530
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,700
what does it do

531
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,120
it takes the name of the file

532
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,980
that you've typed in one that you want

533
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
to search

534
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,600
it memory Maps it so there's a kind of a

535
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
virtual memory thing going on here

536
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,620
basically what it means is you can treat

537
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,520
the entire file as one big string python

538
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,580
thinks it's a string and M map is hiding

539
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,799
the fact that it isn't even in Ram the

540
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,140
fact that it's on disk it doesn't try

541
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,179
and load it all at once so it doesn't

542
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,919
matter if you haven't got 32 gigs of RAM

543
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,160
on your machine M map handles it kudos

544
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,799
to the designers of M map this is one of

545
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,860
the nicest most powerful

546
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,780
obstructions I have ever used in my

547
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,419
career it is genius

548
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,880
um okay so we now have the data sitting

549
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
variable

550
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,840
we take the pattern what we want to

551
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,059
search for well all that's doing is

552
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,539
grabbing it from the args array from the

553
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,820
command line Arguments for the program

554
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,559
we're then going to say I want an

555
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
iterator which looks for that pattern in

556
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,260
that data and then for every match that

557
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,720
it finds printing out the match

558
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,659
that's it grep re-implemented four lines

559
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,880
of python brewed

560
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,799
not my brilliance

561
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,620
pythons

562
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,020
okay back to the story

563
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,299
what did it do when we ran this thing

564
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,080
well it actually produced exactly

565
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,960
that output there so we're searching 32

566
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,480
gigabyte file and it gave me

567
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,220
a dozen lines

568
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,620
all right A lot of them

569
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,380
text files well yes I have an advanced

570
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,039
forensic tool called Notepad which we

571
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,299
use to have a quick look at the text

572
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,240
files nothing very interesting

573
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,840
there's a whole load of DB files SQL

574
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,039
light DB all over Android yeah

575
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,500
look at those SQL light nothing terribly

576
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,539
interesting

577
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,539
the hell is this one ssrm heating.log

578
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,620
never heard of that before

579
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,320
so what we did we actually

580
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,200
gripped through all of these this was

581
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
kind of before I even went to sqlite

582
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,659
um for a looked for a bunch of words

583
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,220
that might be associated with the

584
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,620
particular game so we looked for heat

585
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,700
Gates which was the name of the

586
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,260
manufacturer so the name of the game we

587
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,840
looked for one or other two things

588
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
what did it turn out now I apologize

589
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,360
that this is

590
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,159
um

591
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,340
we found that as a log entry so 1149

592
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,459
timing

593
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,960
what's the biggest asset of a comedian

594
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,980
timing

595
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
um

596
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
no you didn't get that one

597
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,960
right uh

598
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,659
timestamp it matches remember we were

599
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:55,860
thinking about it being an hour out

600
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,299
because of

601
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,640
BST and GMT

602
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,659
top peak games all right well top hang

603
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,760
on top that's a Unix command this is

604
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,620
Android all right so ah actually this

605
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,220
thing or something called net.peak games

606
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,000
dot Amy

607
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,400
was using 12.8 percent of something

608
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:30,140
surface Slinger 2.82 audio server 2.2

609
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,580
the game's running

610
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,340
at that time it's doing something we've

611
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,640
found that it's using resources okay

612
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,679
at that moment we now know we're on to

613
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,059
something there is something being

614
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,320
logged here

615
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,140
we're about to have a bit deeper look at

616
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,140
this ssrm heating box so it's the only

617
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,299
one that matches the time Stone and the

618
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,580
strings connected to the game and we

619
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,159
came up with a whole bunch of log

620
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,039
entries PMP entries commentaries net

621
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,600
entries

622
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,580
top entries

623
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,620
no idea what they are I've never seen

624
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,240
this before in my life either this is

625
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
completely new to me

626
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,100
we've got some stuff which appears to

627
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,120
say

628
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,059
games is actually doing something

629
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,880
at the appropriate time

630
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,919
now none of this is proving the game is

631
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,640
being played yet but we're starting to

632
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,440
get there

633
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
so we'd better do some digging what the

634
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,820
hell is this ssro and heating.log Google

635
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,940
ssrm underscoreheating.log

636
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,500
zero matches

637
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,659
was it zero maybe not quite zero it

638
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,020
wasn't many

639
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,919
relatively few

640
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,440
um okay this is part of a thing called

641
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,140
the Samsung system health manager system

642
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,059
this has nothing to do with health apps

643
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,320
this is about the health of the device

644
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
turns out that what it actually is is

645
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,460
Samsung's monitor safety system

646
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,279
we think it's original purpose was to

647
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,260
stop devices overheating when they were

648
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,840
being gamed too hard

649
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,480
uh in particular that the GPU was being

650
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,820
given too hard and it logs things like

651
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,880
memory usage Network usage temperature

652
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,059
all of the kind of resource things that

653
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,380
you might come across in an operating

654
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,340
system

655
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500
this thing was logging every now and

656
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,419
then all right

657
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,460
possibly it was to do with preventing

658
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,140
overheating possibly it was to do with

659
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,880
actually tuning for games performance

660
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,520
you're not quite sure uh what we did

661
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,159
find out was that it received little or

662
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,980
no attention from the academic Community

663
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,559
certainly from digital academic digital

664
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,500
forensics people nobody heard of it very

665
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,179
very little documentation about it the

666
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,600
only place Ethan queued us to this one

667
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,260
um

668
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,980
XDA Dev Community had heard of this that

669
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,200
was about all we got the rest of it we

670
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,440
had to work out ourselves

671
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,320
so what does it do why is it interesting

672
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,460
um

673
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,279
it basically logs things things stuff

674
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,760
starting on the phones activation and it

675
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,320
obviously has cleared the last factory

676
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,480
reset other than that we couldn't

677
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
actually find out when the log was

678
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,100
cleared it makes a note when the device

679
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,620
is being rebooted so it assists across

680
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,580
sessions

681
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,279
but it doesn't exclusively log games

682
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
it's just logging what's going on and

683
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,539
the system effectively it's kind of

684
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,000
running top every now and then and just

685
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
recording stuff about it

686
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
format looks a lot like that a time

687
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,679
stamp uh followed by some kind of code

688
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,120
and a message

689
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,159
is it a circular buffer does it have a

690
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,840
capacity limit does it overwrite don't

691
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,400
know I can't tell you those that's the

692
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,500
future work inevitably it'll be a

693
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,720
circular buffer so stuff will persist in

694
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,820
there sometime I'm going to virtually

695
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,360
guarantee one day it'll it'll overwrite

696
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,179
so we managed to do some work and we

697
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,980
found out that it logged all of these

698
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,020
different kinds of entries and we did

699
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,700
some some readings and looking through

700
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
and tried to figure off figure out

701
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,200
things like uh when the LCD screen had

702
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,159
been manipulated by set commands uh

703
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,100
logging network connections

704
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,760
handles the charging screen so all kinds

705
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,260
of interesting bits and places that was

706
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,520
the one we liked

707
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,659
very similar to the the Unix top logs

708
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,700
graphic activity basically what's the

709
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,940
GPU doing how busy is it

710
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,960
okay

711
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,020
so after all of that we were able to say

712
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,000
we can prove

713
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,380
that something written by Peak games by

714
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,820
the way there's only one app on that

715
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,220
phone IP games

716
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,860
was actually active and was using the

717
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,220
screen the screen was on the GPU was

718
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,980
busy actually processing graphics for

719
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,779
round about the 20 minutes in question

720
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,700
oh dear

721
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,460
so this is actually corroborating the

722
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,440
accused defense

723
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,779
the victim had been playing again at the

724
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,360
time of the incident and actually

725
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,580
kind of round off that bit of the story

726
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,299
the police went back to the complaint

727
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,340
eventually she admitted the thing had

728
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
been completely fabricated she had a big

729
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,899
round with the boyfriend

730
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,600
and tried to frame him for rape

731
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,159
um they didn't do that at the end they

732
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,440
were talking about possibly Prosecuting

733
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,240
her for wasting police time they didn't

734
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,679
in the end

735
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,720
as with many of these things she

736
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,539
probably needed mental health support

737
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,700
rather than being arrested so I think it

738
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,000
kind of had a happy ending but um

739
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,860
I think it's always interesting to

740
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,059
remember

741
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,279
when we do this stuff yeah we love the

742
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,960
bits and bites we love the technology

743
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,240
there are human beings on the other end

744
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,940
of everything we do I think it's

745
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,460
for those of you who are considering a

746
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,380
career in digital forensics it's

747
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,000
possibly worthwhile just you know

748
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,059
bearing that particular one

749
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,679
okay

750
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,299
so that was kind of the end of the

751
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,659
immediate uh involvement with the police

752
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,140
down Bell Street but we now have this uh

753
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,120
unheard all sorts of evidence the

754
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,860
current J generation of digital

755
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,659
forensics tools know nothing about this

756
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,580
file we thought well this is that's a

757
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,899
bit sad this is quite interesting

758
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,880
there's useful stuffing

759
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,620
how could we actually turn this into

760
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,140
some kind of evidence-grade procedure

761
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,880
some kind of methodology which we could

762
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,380
use for this

763
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,679
um we were fortunate in the ncsc gchq

764
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,980
that year were lashing money about and

765
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,740
we managed to employ an intern for the

766
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,779
summer to actually work on this and do

767
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,760
some background to work on it which uh

768
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,500
turned into a rather a useful thing I'd

769
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,419
like to just talk about that for a few

770
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,820
minutes now

771
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
so in terms of turning it into a DF

772
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,960
digital forensics technique what do we

773
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,039
need to do

774
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,480
um again those of you who've been in my

775
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,880
classroom know that we bang on about a

776
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,100
digital forensics life cycle digital

777
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,919
forensics process consisting roughly of

778
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,020
acquisition extraction evaluation

779
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,580
applicability

780
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,440
visualization I may not have used

781
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,179
exactly those words the last time you

782
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,419
sat in CMP 209 it's

783
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,580
that's the flavor of it

784
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,559
first of all can we image the device in

785
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,120
this case we could yes we're doing

786
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,980
nothing about decrypting phones wrong

787
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,799
talk uh extraction can you find the file

788
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,039
yes we now know where to look at it what

789
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,399
causes events to be logged no idea

790
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,580
oh right that's not really what you call

791
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,620
forensically sound we need to understand

792
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,799
better what makes it actually right a

793
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,120
log entry

794
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,520
how many phones actually use this

795
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,500
Samsung system Health monitoring

796
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,960
software

797
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,179
well this one does

798
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,120
that's all we do at that point

799
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,320
can we make the evidence easy to

800
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,000
comprehend actually I'm going to say we

801
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,460
failed on that one but we can judge that

802
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,520
later

803
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,559
Ethan in his infinite wisdom and this is

804
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,299
pure coincidence I assure you've

805
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,520
actually handed me the phone this

806
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,460
morning uh is returning it after having

807
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,080
or have you been doing with it for the

808
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,700
past three years I don't know I don't

809
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,860
want to know I don't know

810
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,810
factory reset um

811
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,899
[Music]

812
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,919
we don't have access to any 30k plus

813
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,960
forensics Tools around here I wish we

814
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,960
did anybody is now a rich alumni of this

815
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,840
University and wishes to buy Ian a

816
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,820
couple of copies of n case

817
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,559
I'll be good

818
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,600
um but we you know me we like open

819
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,279
source we like the command line what

820
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,140
we're going to do well we'll root the

821
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,240
damn thing and run DD on it okay right

822
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,640
we've got that we can we can we

823
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,700
rooted image so now now we've got spare

824
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,340
form actually identical to the one in

825
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,320
the case same model same we're playing

826
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,059
with this one instead of somebody's

827
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,100
other phone now so that got rooted and

828
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,140
we started seeing what you could do to

829
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,500
the phone which would make it create uh

830
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,419
a log entry

831
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,799
so

832
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,899
once again we were searching for

833
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,820
Relevant strings in particular the

834
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,039
strings that we now knew appeared in the

835
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,059
log

836
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,419
um with big rep and we were able to

837
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,179
access the file system raw using debug

838
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,880
FS if you've never used debug FS as a

839
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,580
way of accessing stuff on ext4 file

840
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,760
systems and things fun stuff

841
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,299
um so that was kind of the before by now

842
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,340
we were confident yeah okay we could

843
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,380
just Mount the damn thing up and find it

844
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,179
a meaningless bit of Linux down the

845
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,799
bottom you can just grab the file off

846
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,440
there and we could achieve it

847
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,440
so key question what causes events now

848
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,880
to be written to the log of this phone

849
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,360
well

850
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,000
you get money from gchq

851
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,340
what do you spend it on you obviously

852
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,940
spend it on hiring intern to walk around

853
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,039
Dundee with a mobile phone in their

854
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,539
pocket for a few days

855
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,240
which is basically what Michael did and

856
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,879
we gave him what we called uh some

857
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,980
structured walks we came up with a you

858
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,780
know we wanted to go here we wanted to

859
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,760
spend so long there we wanted to go

860
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,159
within range of that Wi-Fi we wanted to

861
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,020
take it out we want to access a web page

862
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,639
we wanted to do and we came up with

863
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,859
something that we thought kind of

864
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,020
properly exercised all of the things

865
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,359
that the mobile phone could do but the

866
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,940
point was that we needed them doing

867
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,940
repeatedly and exactly the same time so

868
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,619
if you saw this guy kind of Behaving

869
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,639
really strangely around Dundee and some

870
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,119
of the cafes in 2019 2020 it was it was

871
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,839
us

872
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,440
uh so we used a whole variety of these

873
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,480
things followed it and then basically

874
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,760
what we did was match the log entries

875
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,820
against what we told him to do

876
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,918
what hey Presto of surprise surprise

877
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,200
every time you go past a Wi-Fi place it

878
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,540
logs something and says you're his wife

879
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,940
oh that's quite interesting so the phone

880
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,339
itself is maintaining a list of which

881
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,560
Wi-Fi access points you've been arranged

882
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,380
with

883
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,880
do our privacy researchers know anything

884
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,980
about that one so I thought that was

885
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,320
quite interesting the way back to what

886
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,660
Apple were doing in 2012. that was a

887
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,920
good one

888
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,859
uh okay so we established fairly easily

889
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,660
yeah there's a pretty straightforward

890
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,460
correspondence between Common Sense

891
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,220
everyday life events with the phone and

892
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,079
the log file

893
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,079
has that been tested in court no

894
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,300
would it stand up

895
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,220
I don't see why not but you know maybe

896
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,380
we need to try that one

897
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,599
okay applicability

898
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,660
I didn't do this I'm making no claims

899
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,060
uh how many phones actually have this

900
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,820
file uh what Ethan did was he grabbed

901
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,240
the firmware some firmware from there a

902
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,579
variety of phone models probably reverse

903
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,700
engineered them and confirmed indeed the

904
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,300
executables necessary to run the health

905
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,480
monitoring thing uh were there as was

906
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,599
the actual log file uh S6 to S9 Plus

907
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,300
android 10 7 to 10.

908
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,619
we're guessing it's still there

909
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,660
so you

910
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,859
it's 20 also there you are

911
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,140
okay it doesn't guarantee that it's

912
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,839
running on any given phone I think

913
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,420
Chance is pretty good uh your mileage

914
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,700
may vary if you get to try this kind of

915
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,879
stuff

916
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,560
does that help anybody understand what

917
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,000
was going on the phone

918
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,579
no I don't I I I came to this on my

919
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,260
slides and thought right what shall I

920
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,820
say about this slide and try and explain

921
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,420
it when

922
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,359
um actually actually I could just about

923
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,140
try I think we could say that somehow

924
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,660
we got from the log file that

925
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,460
the Play Store had been accessed

926
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,140
whatever there's a red piece it would

927
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,720
probably be an accessed twice why it's a

928
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,579
peak rather than bar chart I don't know

929
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,280
but the physicist in the is revolting

930
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,420
deeply against this diagram okay

931
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,760
non-labeled axes don't anybody ever

932
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,800
submit the graph to me without the axes

933
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,160
properly labeled or you'll get a bit of

934
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,020
1980s Sunderland University Physics

935
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,660
person down your neck

936
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,640
um no uh I didn't yeah we tried we ran

937
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,180
out of time and money

938
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,119
nearly as early as well I hope you've

939
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,740
got some good questions

940
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,460
um

941
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,980
some conclusions three pages of

942
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,740
conclusions first of all this thing we

943
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,640
think this Samsung system health monitor

944
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,000
manager provides an interesting source

945
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
of digital forensic evidence which

946
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,420
people don't seem to know about I really

947
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,040
should write this up as an academic

948
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,339
paper and publish it

949
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,320
so this is this is it being presented to

950
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,079
the world I hope it's in use to you

951
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,859
um

952
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,780
we've pretty much got a validated

953
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,359
methodology something which has got a

954
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,680
little bit of substance to it which

955
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,060
actually lets us prove that it really

956
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,220
does what we're claiming what it says on

957
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,200
the tin uh it's been tested to some

958
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,480
degree at least it hasn't been stood up

959
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,780
in court

960
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,240
is Big rep

961
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,420
a production digital forensics too no

962
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,820
absolutely isn't it's a nasty little

963
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,880
four-line script uh

964
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
goodbye

965
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,619
oh no it's worse than that actually oh

966
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,160
it's locked

967
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,440
go or get back you little salty oh no

968
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
that's interesting I can't go back any

969
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,079
further who's fiddling who's fiddling

970
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,880
with minor ship you remember the last

971
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
time I was here and I was talking about

972
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,720
all of the Bluetooth snarfing stuff I

973
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
was doing there's a bunch of fortios up

974
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,260
there at the back when I'm doing the

975
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,880
live demo suddenly start creating

976
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,780
Bluetooth devices with rude names

977
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,810
much appreciated guys

978
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,339
[Music]

979
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,339
um

980
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,599
why is that oh

981
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,720
sorry about that uh is it is it

982
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
production standard two no it's not it's

983
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,440
a script it's kind of Handy

984
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,980
um if you're in the game of deriving new

985
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,920
right I now know why that's doing that

986
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
and that's entirely my fault guess who's

987
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,960
say who's copied the slide from

988
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,520
presentation with some timing

989
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,940
information on it whatever whatever

990
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,680
um

991
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,380
take regret use it it's released under a

992
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,140
do what you like with it license

993
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,800
um

994
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,700
have fun with it

995
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,859
you can't remember what else I was going

996
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,480
to say about it can't be but I can't be

997
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,740
bothered to go through all of that

998
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,500
living room to go back to the past slide

999
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,280
um

1000
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,060
I suppose the point I wanted to make was

1001
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,740
how long have I been in this game how

1002
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,660
long have I been doing Computing for

1003
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,200
longer than

1004
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
Millennials aren't you

1005
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,680
no not quite not quite

1006
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,780
let's call it 30 years it's actually

1007
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,760
more that I've been creating software

1008
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,240
and doing doing stuff with computers

1009
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,000
I think those four lines are code

1010
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,980
possibly the best four lines of code

1011
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,500
that I've ever written

1012
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,420
I I'm actually being deadly serious

1013
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,859
about this I mean I've written huge

1014
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,660
systems but I've written stuff from my

1015
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,079
PhD with you know 200 000 lines of code

1016
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,420
actually I think those four are best I

1017
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,180
got more satisfaction from those four

1018
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,339
and any of the other stuff I've done the

1019
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,220
sheer power of being able to say just

1020
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,320
treat that file as a string Now search

1021
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,460
it

1022
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,700
I think if you realize what you would

1023
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,720
have to go through to do that manually

1024
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,760
not money to even wipe the code to do

1025
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,339
that without that in math thing I'm just

1026
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:18,540
you know on an nmap Fanboy yeah

1027
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,680
okay

1028
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,740
um

1029
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,140
third thing is the importance of kind of

1030
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,400
fundamentals

1031
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,099
in in digital forensics uh you know we

1032
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,140
all get excited by the latest greatest

1033
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,880
shiny tools

1034
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,220
we love you know the Deep technical

1035
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,619
stuff that you're going to hear a whole

1036
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,720
load more about today

1037
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,820
don't forget your fundamentals don't

1038
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,900
forget that it's actually quite

1039
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,300
important that you

1040
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,339
you somebody somebody in your

1041
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,079
organization

1042
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,359
has that ability to go

1043
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,599
right time step it's a number how's it

1044
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,240
represented it's represented like this

1045
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,920
it'll be searched for like this the

1046
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,079
regex was that

1047
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,119
it's all first year stuff

1048
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,280
second year stuff there's nothing that

1049
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,680
difficult in anything I did here and yet

1050
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,359
I hope it's proved that it was something

1051
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,359
that was of you know genuine real world

1052
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,980
actual actual value uh and you know I I

1053
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,859
encourage you

1054
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:21,839
shouldn't throw the pointer away uh

1055
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,760
you'll have heard me bang on about this

1056
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,640
before somebody beats his knowledge you

1057
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,440
know that's what this game is really

1058
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,599
about about understanding what the

1059
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,540
number of silicon in front of you

1060
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,700
is doing how it does it and all that

1061
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,020
kind of thing so just to encourage you

1062
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,339
to keep on going with that sense

1063
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,339
uh the future things we should do

1064
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,800
um is there equivalent functionality in

1065
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,380
other phones uh I strongly suspect that

1066
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,180
Apple has something very similar to that

1067
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,300
in iOS somewhere is there equivalent

1068
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,980
functionality into the Samsung devices

1069
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,099
we've got Samsung smart TV at home

1070
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,859
it's sneakily monitoring when I turn it

1071
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,140
on I don't know anybody wants to find me

1072
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,500
another big Samsung I'll quite happily

1073
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,599
take it apart and have a look

1074
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,720
um

1075
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,280
just simply trying that technique on

1076
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,980
other devices on iot forensics a couple

1077
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,900
of PhD Folks at the moment working on

1078
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,240
doing forensic investigation of iot

1079
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,060
devices may be actually going into that

1080
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,619
low level and looking for stuff like

1081
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,900
that might be an interesting thing for

1082
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,180
us to try so some future work to have a

1083
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,839
go at that uh very finely a couple of

1084
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,079
thanks really first of all to DCI mark

1085
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,599
lorente from tayside police sorry police

1086
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,800
Scotland

1087
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,319
for having the faith in us to just walk

1088
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,480
along the road bang on the door and say

1089
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,859
can you do anything with this without

1090
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,839
that none of this would have happened it

1091
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,640
doesn't happen often that somebody just

1092
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,680
lands on the door and says here's an

1093
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,660
interesting problem but when it does uh

1094
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,579
it's kind of one of those really nice

1095
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,040
moments of your career and also a big

1096
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,920
thanks to Michael our summer intern who

1097
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,420
did a lot of the Harvard graft of

1098
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,720
actually turning some fairly nebulous

1099
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,940
ideas and some hucking around with

1100
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,760
python into a properly validated

1101
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,599
methodology

1102
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,579
if you want big red it's there

1103
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,619
uh

1104
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,660
promise I'm not rickrolling you much

1105
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,279
with that uh

1106
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,110
[Music]

1107
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,060
good there you go right that's the end

1108
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,599
any any questions

1109
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,839
I think I think we tried I think we've

1110
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,300
got absolutely nowhere

1111
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,880
um I think that that mind you

1112
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,980
I certainly don't have the contacts in

1113
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,240
Samsung

1114
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,339
um I think we you know we were at the

1115
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,500
stage of digging a couple of email

1116
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,480
addresses off the Samsung website and

1117
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,579
just emailing them speculatively I don't

1118
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,200
actually know anybody who works do we

1119
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,700
have anybody from Samsung in this

1120
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,780
morning

1121
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,460
and if they do they're not admitting to

1122
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,619
it they're furiously ringing what the

1123
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,900
hell is this system monitoring thing

1124
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,319
um no uh so the short answer we tried

1125
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,460
but no

1126
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,640
foreign

1127
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,900
will be limited by a 64-bit pointer so 2

1128
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,500
to the power 64 bytes

1129
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,800
if anybody wants to work that out

1130
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,440
Nick wants to know over there I don't

1131
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,119
hold the number in my mind it's big

1132
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,119
computer

1133
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,220
I think if you deleted one line out of

1134
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,720
it the chances are you're not going to

1135
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,619
notice

1136
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,540
I think if you delete 20 minutes worth

1137
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,220
out of it you're going to spot it

1138
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,200
because the phone's actually

1139
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,579
sorry I should be up here for the

1140
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,740
microphones uh

1141
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,020
the phone is constantly logging things

1142
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,760
and doing things even when it's sitting

1143
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,260
by your bedside at night and you're not

1144
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,200
touching it it's automatic updates and

1145
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,359
God knows what else it's doing and that

1146
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:31,619
kind of thing is loads I mean I think

1147
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:32,700
you would notice it in those

1148
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,180
circumstances

1149
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,680
foreign

1150
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,640
how did we come up with the structured

1151
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,740
walk that we started doing basically we

1152
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,560
cheated so you know we we we we did a

1153
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,000
couple of rough ones

1154
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,859
and just looked to see what was in there

1155
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,839
and we started seeing things like you

1156
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,420
know Wi-Fi equals Starbucks

1157
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,099
okay

1158
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,200
um URL

1159
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,599
this at this time and you kind of

1160
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,040
figured well okay

1161
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,140
what we need to do is to do all of the

1162
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,599
kind of systemy things which are kind of

1163
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,960
built into raw brings so like networking

1164
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,420
things like doing an update that kind of

1165
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,460
thing so they all got Incorporated

1166
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,960
and then it was a question of looking at

1167
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,760
well let's let's consider the kind of

1168
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,380
apps that somebody has a foot on their

1169
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,880
phone is there a typical app Well

1170
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,099
everybody's got a browser

1171
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,839
everybody's got Facebook

1172
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:45,560
don't they

1173
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,579
so you know we just picked a few on

1174
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:51,900
you know I think I'm going to stand up

1175
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,819
and say that's that's the limit of the

1176
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:55,440
rigor of the

1177
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,819
thing really what else can you do it's

1178
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,619
got to be your imagination about what

1179
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,020
can this phone do if you do it to the

1180
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,880
phone does anything appear in the log

1181
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,920
and you know some some things did some

1182
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,260
things didn't but by and large the kind

1183
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,940
of things that you might expect it to

1184
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,619
log yeah there was an entry there

1185
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:12,660
sometimes even sometimes it's just okay

1186
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,060
how busy is the processing you know

1187
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,740
particular Point there's a spike in

1188
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,520
there

1189
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,220
in the

1190
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,280
[Music]

1191
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,319
uh you know stuff top returns and you

1192
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,079
say okay busy at that point

1193
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,359
screen on screen off

1194
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,060
backlight on backlight off

1195
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,920
see other bits of hardware on the phone

1196
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,480
I think

1197
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,579
we can't honestly remember did we did we

1198
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,079
check for the Bluetooth it's been turned

1199
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:37,980
on and off

1200
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,020
it's okay it was looking what is the

1201
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,579
hardware capable of what might it be

1202
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,040
used for is there an entry for it

1203
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,480
make it up on the spur of the moment

1204
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,319
oh

1205
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,500
foreign

1206
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,819
question how do you keep a forensic

1207
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,680
methodology up to date okay

1208
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,300
the answer is that you write it in

1209
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,760
suitably abstract level if you're if

1210
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,859
your methodology is you know press this

1211
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,319
button enter the number two scroll down

1212
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,359
twice

1213
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,440
you know that's going to be out of date

1214
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,920
six months if it is point one understand

1215
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,020
the hardware of the device from whatever

1216
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,780
Source Point two understand the inputs

1217
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,599
and outputs to this system 0.3 find a

1218
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,880
way of capturing those inputs but if you

1219
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,819
write a suitably abstract level then it

1220
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,980
you know it's survivability is longer I

1221
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,240
reckon you can write the digital

1222
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,319
forensics methodology

1223
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,400
okay one of one of the points that I

1224
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,140
bang on continually about to the

1225
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,780
students here is you know

1226
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,000
what's that

1227
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,380
see if any of them have been listening

1228
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,060
what is it

1229
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,640
yeah somebody said it's a computer okay

1230
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,140
so all of the stuff that we've been

1231
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,640
doing with computer forensics and

1232
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,400
digital forensics for the past 20 years

1233
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,000
is precisely applicable to this it's got

1234
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,880
input devices it's got storage it's got

1235
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,500
all of the things that you know your

1236
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,480
desktop computer has got don't treat it

1237
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,460
any differently and if your methodology

1238
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,260
is written sufficient should be

1239
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,140
abstractly to cope with that level

1240
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,000
I've got one of the one of the guys from

1241
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,680
a PhD guys at the moment that's doing

1242
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,839
stuff on iot forensics and you know I've

1243
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:40,980
said it needs to come up with a

1244
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,500
methodology what I'm looking for in that

1245
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,000
methodology

1246
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,220
is not you know connect the USB

1247
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,240
connected to that it's

1248
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,960
one go away and understand the hardware

1249
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,400
on the device you're doing it from

1250
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,200
whether that's from the manual whether

1251
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,760
it's via internet search

1252
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,619
try and find out about the device first

1253
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,440
second stage okay now you can take it

1254
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,660
apart and have a look and see what's in

1255
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,220
there can you identify the storage

1256
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,460
device that black thing there that looks

1257
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,920
like a chip all right

1258
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,160
processor chip is it a non-flash chip is

1259
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,740
it storage chip is there one option all

1260
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,480
right and you know you can you can write

1261
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,000
your methodology such that it can cope

1262
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,380
with that kind of thing that I think

1263
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,619
stands a chance of surviving for a while

1264
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,839
admittedly yeah there is there is a

1265
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,058
problem technology changes we've got it

1266
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,339
how am I doing

1267
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:42,140
I've another 10 minutes oh my God

1268
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,880
some of you may remember that we used to

1269
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,000
do lectures in room 3006 which has the

1270
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,200
piano up front

1271
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,880
that was always good for a giggle when

1272
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,099
we ran out of material uh right sorry

1273
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,119
there was another yes

1274
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,629
[Music]

1275
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,500
that's a very good question I can't give

1276
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,760
you a straight answer to that one I

1277
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,380
think the answer is probably quite a lot

1278
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,319
but it was just the one that really

1279
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,079
caught our eye was this top thing

1280
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,140
I'm a that identified how much

1281
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,480
The Source certain processes we're using

1282
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,359
and that as far as we know so even when

1283
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,099
you've got an app like this game which

1284
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,740
frankly doesn't do very much

1285
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,480
it's still appearing in the log it never

1286
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,760
logs anything explicitly itself

1287
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,339
but because this is being monitored it

1288
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:46,020
appeared there and that that seemed like

1289
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,119
a useful source of information so I I

1290
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,920
can't give you a percentage it's

1291
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,300
probably something that should be done

1292
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,099
anybody wants to find me a project you

1293
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:54,599
know

1294
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:57,480
cross check the heat log against some of

1295
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,619
the other sources that would be an

1296
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,819
interesting thing to validate

1297
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:11,059
[Music]

1298
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:13,980
it was it was within it was within a

1299
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,900
couple of days but what we did observe

1300
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,660
was the log went back a months

1301
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,240
so it obviously been quite a while since

1302
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,319
the log has cycled over

1303
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,819
it but certainly persistently as far as

1304
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,020
we can tell the only thing that it

1305
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,160
doesn't persist through is a factory

1306
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,578
reset

1307
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,359
any more for any more oh

1308
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,900
that's a good question how long

1309
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:47,640
real time probably about six weeks from

1310
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,260
first getting the phone to actually

1311
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,880
being able to go back to the police with

1312
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
some confidence and say yeah we know

1313
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,319
that that phone was that game was being

1314
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,900
played at that time uh

1315
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,300
that wasn't six weeks me working on it

1316
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,980
full-time University don't work like

1317
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,440
that kind of thing but I of that order

1318
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,300
[Music]

1319
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,660
is

1320
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,180
it together

1321
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:28,980
we certainly did but that was kind of

1322
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,319
more in the kind of deeper understanding

1323
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,540
methodological stage when we were

1324
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,980
actually still talking to the police

1325
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,380
live you know I was very conscious that

1326
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,740
this was a a live investigation

1327
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,420
basically as soon as we had a couple of

1328
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,400
entries in the log said look this phone

1329
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,200
has been busy with this game in this

1330
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,180
period

1331
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,619
um they were they were very keen on

1332
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,460
hearing that early

1333
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
um

1334
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:10,079
conclusions for example

1335
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,920
the absence

1336
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,500
[Music]

1337
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,400
it's probably a generic for it

1338
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,960
right it's no it's a reasonable question

1339
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,579
well it's a philosophical question can

1340
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,619
you prove an absence of evidence what is

1341
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,240
it what does it say

1342
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,079
um in the end not a lot all you can do

1343
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,339
sometimes is say look we have

1344
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:35,760
indications something was going on here

1345
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,099
and that feeds back into the real life

1346
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:40,260
investigation

1347
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,940
I mean what happened here was you know

1348
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,200
as soon as as soon as we had some

1349
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,599
indication something was going on

1350
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,180
they went back to the person so young

1351
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,339
hang on your story doesn't quite stuck

1352
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:53,040
up here and actually it was admitted

1353
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,800
relatively easily in terms of the kind

1354
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,020
of rigor that you're talking about yes

1355
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,300
there is more work to be done I'm not

1356
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,839
going to hide that

1357
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,200
oh

1358
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,319
in a sense this is it you know what what

1359
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,260
I should do is write paper and publish

1360
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,319
it in digital investigations

1361
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,059
started I've sat down and started to

1362
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,920
write that paper about three times you

1363
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,599
think you students are good at avoiding

1364
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,380
deadlines and procrastination master

1365
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,200
um something yeah the proper thing to do

1366
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,420
I now that I've actually

1367
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,099
you may find that you folks are being

1368
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:46,800
very useful in that you've forced me to

1369
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,240
think about this again maybe I should

1370
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,559
now sit down and actually write that

1371
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,300
paper that would go into digital

1372
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,020
forensics that is red in the labs and

1373
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,300
that's certainly read by the people who

1374
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,579
make the software so that that's kind of

1375
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:01,740
the way of feeding back into it

1376
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,779
um so yeah that's that'll be how it goes

1377
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,460
anybody got anything else or are you all

1378
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,960
running away go on yes sir

1379
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,900
uh I think they're actually there are

1380
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,280
actually multiple entries in one line

1381
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,800
and I think it's a lot of them

1382
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,660
um

1383
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,280
you've got me can't remember off the top

1384
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,040
of my head but there was multiple things

1385
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,319
processor core GPU and a couple of other

1386
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,780
bits and pieces as well

1387
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,000
right I am actually going to showed up

1388
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,280
at that point and uh let you get off to

1389
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,420
the next tour thank you
