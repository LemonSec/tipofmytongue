1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,060
thank you very much

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,839
um

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,900
firstly what are you doing here can I

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,500
read the slides

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,299
um yeah so I thought I'd give a talk of

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,580
like this is something I always worry

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,539
about

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,840
um in my career in my current job it's

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
it's very very very difficult keeping up

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
with things

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,140
um often it's at times where you just I

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,119
don't know what I'm doing I have a lot

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,340
to learn I know nothing

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,320
um how do I figure out what what I need

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
to know

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,540
um in the most efficient way as possible

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,700
so just a quick one about myself

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,180
um so I'm one of the co-leaders that I

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,219
was Scotland chapter

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,980
um and I really enjoy uh networking and

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,840
sharing information so

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,140
I stream uh I would say regularly but

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,840
lately it's not been happily there as

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,579
much as I would like I feel I'll start

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,320
that off again it'll stream on Twitter

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,260
uh sorry twitch and YouTube

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,060
um and then I'm also quite active on

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,880
Twitter a little bit of masterton

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
um and then GitHub trying to do some

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,780
stuff not often

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,600
but anyway enough about that so just

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,760
coming off kind of where I've come from

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,759
and where I currently am because this I

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,380
feel is important

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,020
um in terms of understanding the things

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,820
that I've learned along the way the

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,159
different reasons why I've done certain

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,960
things and uh the things more

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
importantly that you don't want to do

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,520
so like most people attend school yes

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,140
um and then went to University

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,380
and after that

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,439
um this is probably showing my age now

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,780
um but when I left University security

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,420
was quite in its infancy

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,220
um so for me

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,439
I had an interest in security security

48
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,619
was something that was peaked in

49
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,020
university did a network of security

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,659
course which come to end of it and

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,160
that's what really got my interest going

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
but unfortunately at the time it was

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,220
very Niche we are where um I was

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,080
personally because I came from South

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
Africa it was very Niche there

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,760
um so job at job opportunities and

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,520
security were like few and far between

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,160
was primarily consultancy based so I

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
went into development it's the first

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,080
thing you could get when you at a

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
university you're trying to get your

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,760
first job all that good stuff

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,980
so I did that for a few years around

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,480
about eight years

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,399
um and then luckily I caught a break

66
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,400
hopefully I'll stay this time

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,599
um yeah so a quarter break and uh joined

68
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,300
a company called secureworks where I was

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,099
development but then I always had the

70
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,660
vision of moving into security and

71
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,300
thankfully that panned out that way

72
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,959
um

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,440
and yeah from them I learned quite a bit

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,900
um especially around the the topics

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,519
later on this talk

76
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,060
um so that's why I'll focus on most

77
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,180
um well

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,739
when we got a University degree I can

79
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,599
still remember it like yesterday

80
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,819
all of us we had our Bachelor science

81
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,400
degree and this was us we know

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,720
everything we are the business

83
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,640
yeah not

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,700
uh we'll quickly find out so we've done

85
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,560
a bachelor science this was in uh honors

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,799
yes or postgraduate yeah and probably

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,980
the first week we realized how little we

88
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,480
actually knew

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,099
um and very quickly

90
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,560
but to me it was one of the most

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,659
important kind of lessons that we

92
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,799
learned

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,659
um it's kind of put us in our place

94
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,500
don't be arrogant don't be overconfident

95
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,760
um and also realize where your

96
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
shortcomings are

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,980
but I also said ASAP for things like

98
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,760
um

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
things that we had to realize that we

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,580
didn't know

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,120
um but I come to that in the next slide

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,659
um

103
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,260
so

104
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,800
[Music]

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,060
as I said I have no idea what I'm doing

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,020
um

107
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,479
so yeah as I mentioned

108
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,720
um we did a course on network security

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,580
Now

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,320
I'd agree it was in Bachelor science

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,600
computer science so primarily software

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,900
development and if I look back to what

113
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,699
we learned here and there and what we

114
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,639
should have known it's kind of crazy so

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,259
SQL injection

116
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,440
nope never heard of that no touch once

117
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,060
across our scripted

118
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,800
nope

119
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
authentication yeah

120
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,840
authorization yeah those are already in

121
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,639
our postgrad

122
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,580
business logic Force nope

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,160
security misconfiguration no so we're

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,259
coming out of University

125
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,380
um not knowing any of these topics and I

126
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,759
don't want to go back to some of the

127
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,220
code that I wrote over the years because

128
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,960
yeah

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,759
um but that's important because we're

130
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,320
coming out of University thinking we

131
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,060
know all this stuff like we know

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,639
everything we can develop software in a

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,139
production environment all that great

134
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,039
stuff when in reality we didn't

135
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,460
and the security logging

136
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,560
um so that was an important lesson

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,660
um only after the fact the other thing

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,000
that I want to say is

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,039
for me honest was the most beneficial

140
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,440
Year my entire career University

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,180
learning

142
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,759
um what I learned in that one year set

143
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,979
me up for the rest of my career

144
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,280
Russia signs been three years great as I

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,259
said we're all rocked up thought we knew

146
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,300
what we're doing first week here's the

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,520
first project off you're going yet

148
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,740
okay what do we do Google

149
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,740
um and if you ask me what is the single

150
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,199
most tool or the single most important

151
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,300
tool that you ever use in your job

152
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,419
Google start page Brave whatever search

153
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,819
engine if you're not using this on a

154
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,740
daily basis then

155
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,180
um yeah

156
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,940
I I use this on a pretty much daily

157
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,600
basis for just about everything I do

158
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
um so that's probably one of the most

159
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,258
useful tools in Your Arsenal

160
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,039
then

161
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,620
this is a challenge so I come from

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,900
uh software development my primary focus

163
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,000
and application security and one of the

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,520
biggest challenges I face today is

165
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,560
Technologies not because I don't like

166
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,020
them I love technology technology is

167
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,460
awesome

168
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,479
um but it's so hard to keep up

169
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,100
and brothers

170
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,620
I mean girl if you take a look back

171
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,300
through the years and see the kind of

172
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,860
technologies that companies stuck with

173
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,440
this is just a very rudimentary list

174
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
there that you might face in a typical

175
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,060
organization back in the day

176
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,060
when dinosaurs ruined Earth

177
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,300
um yeah you can see it's it's not that

178
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,979
much to get a hold of

179
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,900
where's now

180
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,539
you got all these and that's not

181
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,340
unforeseen for all a single organization

182
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,500
to probably be leveraging most if not

183
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,639
all of these

184
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,840
so

185
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,720
it's really difficult to keep up

186
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,060
um and new technologies are coming out

187
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,340
all the time some of these Technologies

188
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,560
are evolving as well

189
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,620
um and it's it's really really difficult

190
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,440
so from my job I have to kind of be I

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,240
want to say an expert in all these but

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,099
I'm not because I have no idea about

193
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,240
things like

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
kubernetes

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,840
it's it's a weakness that I definitely

196
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,479
know I don't have skill set so I have to

197
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,300
go off and load up that skill set

198
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,759
s but then you also have the time and

199
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,580
resources issues so I need to find the

200
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,819
time to do it but I don't so it it's

201
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,160
probably one of the biggest challenges

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,379
um in the sector especially if you you

203
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,059
focus in on things like application

204
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,159
security or even other parts of security

205
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,779
where there's a lot of new technologies

206
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,640
being introduced

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,799
for teams that often don't see this

208
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,059
they'll go oh there's this new

209
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,979
technology more introduce it into our

210
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:44,820
team

211
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
which is great they they have the

212
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,620
resources to maybe focus on three or

213
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,959
four resources whereas you see here you

214
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,660
have to focus on I don't know 10 10 or

215
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,019
so so it is a real challenge

216
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,019
so the other thing is once you've got to

217
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,000
degree in that you might go okay well

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,820
we'll go do certifications

219
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
and apologies that is hard to read but

220
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,980
the point is it's not reading that's but

221
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,320
those are kind of all the certifications

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
I don't care if it's everything but the

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
vast majority of certifications within

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,040
cyber security today

225
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,100
where do you start

226
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,980
um sure there's common ones like Che

227
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,300
which is a common ethical hacker uh your

228
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,060
ocsp and those kinds of things but

229
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,920
there's a whole bunch of other ones just

230
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,580
some certifications done by Sands

231
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,620
um and so on and so forth

232
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
it's even really difficult to figure out

233
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,640
where you're going to slide on you so

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,540
where where do you begin what do you do

235
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,060
um just a thing on certifications as

236
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,019
well

237
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,940
um

238
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,720
personally I'm not a big fan of them but

239
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,380
so bad they are really useful there are

240
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,660
there is value in them

241
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,160
um if you're going to go down the road

242
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,779
of certifications make sure you're doing

243
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,100
it for yourself

244
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,860
rather than just because you know it's

245
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,800
some some acronym to put me on your name

246
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,660
make sure you want to do it make sure

247
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,100
you want to get it

248
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
um personally I've probably two or three

249
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,380
that I may be interested in for myself

250
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,140
I'm not interested in trying to get it

251
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,620
because it adds some acronyms to money

252
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,700
um I think that's really important

253
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,920
because these days so many people may be

254
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
fixated on just getting a certification

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,600
that's not going to really help them

256
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
um it's a lot of times a lot of

257
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,660
resources and as well they're pretty

258
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,800
costly

259
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,120
um and that's not to say they're not

260
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,519
valuable and there's value to gain out

261
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,860
of it but there are other ways things

262
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,660
such as like experience personal

263
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,240
research that you may even get better

264
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,620
value out of

265
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,600
um especially in your in terms of your

266
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,420
own career and further in your your

267
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,000
kind of image and brand personal brand

268
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
so

269
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,360
a lot of things around well

270
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,220
what do we do like

271
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,420
wait

272
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,640
we we're at this point where we realized

273
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,560
okay well we don't know a lot of stuff

274
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,899
there's a lot of new technologies how do

275
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,519
you stay on top of it how do we learn

276
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,200
new things

277
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
um and all of that well the first thing

278
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,560
is realizing that it's often feels like

279
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,420
an uphill battle

280
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,019
um

281
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,680
it can be quite overwhelming you have

282
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,320
this influx of all these Technologies

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
slang on you as well as the minds so for

284
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
example in Marrow you have I think

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
things are something like kubernetes we

286
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,000
are absolutely no expert in that I want

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,279
to get to that point but I'm not at the

288
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,100
moment but my role means that I need to

289
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,640
provide guidance and advice for some of

290
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,500
the things around kubernetes for

291
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,720
instance so it becomes overwhelming

292
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,300
where you have this issue well I don't

293
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
know that enough technical details

294
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,720
around the the atom to provide really

295
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
solid advice

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,860
so that can be a bit of overwhelming

297
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
plus then you get all the other

298
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,820
Technologies thrown on top of it and

299
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,040
Technologies don't State static is

300
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,660
constantly evolving in terms of

301
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,420
Technologies as well as threats straight

302
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,519
axes are out there doing all sorts of

303
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,220
new things new vulnerability types

304
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,820
um so it can feel uh like a lot of at a

305
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,940
time

306
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,540
so

307
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,700
part of that

308
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,760
don't be afraid so we're nothing

309
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,040
one of the things I think is important

310
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,500
and really really

311
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,180
um I think there's a lot of support in

312
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,040
the community for this

313
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
is my own way of strengths and

314
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
weaknesses are but also be in a not

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,700
afraid to admit and publicly admit those

316
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,120
and saying look I don't know this uh so

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,980
in my case for example the kubernetes

318
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,320
lab I'll be more than happy to say look

319
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,620
I'm not an expert in this I'll go off

320
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,200
and do a bunch of research or I'll give

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,899
the best of advice that I have based on

322
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,639
my previous experience with other

323
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,160
Technologies but it's important to

324
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,959
realize where your limits are and be

325
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,820
open and honest about it

326
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,680
we'll also feel comfortable in doing

327
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,200
that I know often at times that

328
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,160
people might feel that if they do that

329
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,720
that could have other ramifications

330
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,600
which will come to you a bit later

331
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,420
um but to me

332
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,519
admitting that some of these things

333
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,279
are things that you don't know

334
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,300
um

335
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,700
things like um

336
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,120
job interviews a classic example

337
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,880
um where some sometimes people will try

338
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,620
just make up things as they're going

339
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,959
through the job interview or in some

340
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,820
cases I'm her clattering on the keyboard

341
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,920
while asking the question

342
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,200
that's going to come off far more worse

343
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
than you'd just be an open honest and

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,940
say look I don't know this but I'm more

345
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,100
than happy to learn and pick up from it

346
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,440
that says a lot more than just trying to

347
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,260
make your way through it and again you

348
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,600
should be able to do this freely and

349
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,579
confidently without any sort of

350
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,019
repercussions

351
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,019
so I think that's really important

352
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,519
personally from our perspective if I'm

353
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,380
hiring anyone or having you on my team

354
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,800
that's something that I think is really

355
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,540
really important for them to have and

356
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,600
something that I value a lot

357
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,639
so

358
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,680
what do you do to gain all this

359
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,420
knowledge like how do you go about

360
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,720
trying to get all this information

361
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,519
and learn new things on that so the

362
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
first one is Capture the Flag all right

363
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,440
um

364
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,839
I remember doing my first one and it

365
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,279
kind of

366
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,740
was something I always put off because I

367
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,839
was worried that

368
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,420
um you know there's a person and a

369
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,940
professional job if I didn't file any

370
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,180
Flags what would that look like how

371
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,459
would that reflect on me both on the

372
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,079
professional level as well as a personal

373
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,300
level how would I react if I didn't find

374
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,320
anything

375
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,300
but as I did more and more of these

376
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,079
things

377
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,800
I saw the value so one of the best

378
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,500
things about capsule the flags

379
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,680
is you get outside of your own area or

380
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,220
your own scope and that broadens your

381
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,380
um kind of awareness and visibility into

382
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,240
other areas of cyber security so for as

383
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I said I'm in application security but I

384
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,300
know nothing about forensics

385
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,480
um or I know nothing about

386
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,279
IRS kind of forensics but nothing about

387
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,320
like reverse engineering in that

388
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,899
all of these things whole play into part

389
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,880
of your job regardless of what role you

390
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,100
have it's always good to have that

391
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,440
broader knowledge so things like capture

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,680
the flags really really help with that

393
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,480
um and also teaches you new techniques

394
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,279
new tools

395
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,240
um and just as important you form new uh

396
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,399
networking so you can form friends

397
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,959
professional networking even within the

398
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,760
industry so people with different

399
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,699
companies different roles like who may

400
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,860
one day be able to help you out or you

401
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,680
may be able to help them out so to me

402
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,079
Capital flags are really really good way

403
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,240
to expand your knowledge and also

404
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,399
understand where kind of some of your

405
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,980
weaknesses are so if you see a flag and

406
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,440
you like PHP

407
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,079
is a fan of PHP here

408
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,199
sorry

409
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm not a fan

410
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,399
but PHP is something that's quite common

411
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
in capture the flags and as a result I

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,220
don't like it for that reason

413
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,480
um but

414
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,120
it's it's good to understand where your

415
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,940
weaknesses are so for me I know that PHP

416
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,100
is something that I'm not great at so

417
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,500
either I need to learn more on it or I

418
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
just admit it and focus on other areas

419
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,299
if I was going for a role

420
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,579
PHP will probably be something that I'd

421
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,040
have to definitely brush up on before I

422
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,599
even attempted to go for that role

423
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,459
and the other really nice thing is

424
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,220
there's just so much out there

425
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,380
um as I mentioned when I first began my

426
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,939
career there was like nothing in

427
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,919
security

428
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,240
anyone remember a site called Ulta Vista

429
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,480
okay one two two people so yes

430
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,080
um that's kind of how long ago if I say

431
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,620
Alta Vista was kind of dark the the

432
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,799
forms top software most of the security

433
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,840
communication and chats and what would

434
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,580
that happen and now it's kind of like

435
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,520
the resource so that kind of shows you

436
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
um a while ago what was out there versus

437
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,059
now something like this

438
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,720
ctfs

439
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,160
as far as I know they weren't a thing

440
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,220
back then but now there are so many

441
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,660
um and the other great thing is they

442
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,900
cover such a wide variety so

443
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,100
um you obviously got the security

444
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,740
security one that's running at the

445
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,140
moment but there are a bunch of others

446
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,539
so Pico CTF is another really really

447
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,120
good one so I highly advice

448
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,840
um

449
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,799
it's also run by a university and the

450
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,600
great thing about that is some of these

451
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,120
ctfs can be really really challenging we

452
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,100
go from like Zero to Hero where

453
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,799
something like pico CTF is from beginner

454
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,900
friendly all the way up I think that's

455
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,299
really important to call out if you're

456
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,940
going to do Capital flag remember when I

457
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,160
said I was always worried about doing

458
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,620
caps of the flag because I worried how

459
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,660
it reflected me nothing's more

460
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,700
frustrating than trying to do a CTF and

461
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,080
you find nothing

462
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,160
so I'm making sure that you do a CTF

463
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,020
that aligns with your current skills

464
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,720
gets the skill sets and build it up from

465
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,820
there so that's why something like pico

466
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,919
CTF is really great start off at the

467
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,840
bottom work your way up

468
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,419
um things like hack the Box

469
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,580
um they have some relatively easy boxes

470
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,220
but that's kind of more advanced levels

471
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,860
so again great if you've done a lot of

472
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,320
CTS but also

473
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,039
um

474
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,980
be aware so you might want to do things

475
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,520
like pico CTF or even things like eslats

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
they have several ctfs and then try hack

477
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,679
me halves some things as well

478
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,260
um just one word of course another CTS

479
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,600
they're often not really relevant to

480
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,640
real world so some of the scenarios are

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,260
now pretty

482
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,600
far-fetched

483
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
um it's good to understand that there

484
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
could be a possibility but probably in

485
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,940
the real world business tough scenario

486
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,700
they're probably not going to happen so

487
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
it's it's worth understanding that but

488
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,220
again networking socializing numerous

489
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,780
Discord servers that kind of thing

490
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,539
really really good way to learn new

491
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,580
things and broaden your horizons

492
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,860
other thing online learning there's

493
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,600
loads and loads

494
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,580
um the best part about it most of them

495
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,840
are free

496
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,059
so you don't have to spend thousands on

497
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,980
going some some training course or

498
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,840
something like that a lot of it's freely

499
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,000
available so you've got things like uh

500
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,660
hack the Box a hack the Box Academy

501
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
it's awesome I highly recommend you go

502
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,220
check it out they're very interesting

503
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,940
um model so you have like a cubes or

504
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,620
something that basically are in their

505
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,260
monetary thing you you sign up you get

506
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,059
free ones and then as you complete

507
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,640
courses you earn more cubes whatever

508
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,320
they call their monetary thing I forgot

509
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,360
what it is or you can buy more so it's

510
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,580
it's an interesting approach

511
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,799
um I think it's quite a unique and good

512
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,000
approach

513
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
um so as you complete more things you

514
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,900
earn more so you can do more

515
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,120
um but yeah go check it out it's really

516
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,320
well done

517
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,419
um other things like web Suite web app

518
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,080
web Security Academy so they cover most

519
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,820
of the common web application

520
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,640
vulnerabilities also really well done

521
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,940
all Hands-On learning so I think that's

522
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,120
something else important to call Archer

523
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,940
most of these are Hands-On learning

524
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,400
um it's going to very much depend on you

525
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,260
as an individual

526
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,799
but I find Hands-On getting familiar

527
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,140
with the tools actually doing things is

528
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,600
a lot better than actually just sitting

529
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,760
through a bunch of PowerPoint slides or

530
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,220
something like that

531
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,039
so yeah we're uh web Security Academy

532
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,740
bar automobile very much does that you

533
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,900
go down several parts and you can

534
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,360
complete them get certification I think

535
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,179
they do certifications but yeah

536
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,159
um try hack me is another one kind of

537
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,620
equivalent to hack the box that have a

538
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,960
whole bunch of free stuff as well so

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,760
again there

540
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,799
um and then other resources outside of

541
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,780
that you've got iOS a bunch of online

542
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,760
material

543
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,860
a lot of this is probably more useful

544
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,600
for referencing

545
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,520
um so if you have something like I don't

546
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,559
know SQL injection what does a SQL

547
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,760
injection look like what are the

548
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,440
different kind of payloads something

549
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
like oh what's uh cheat sheets and that

550
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,120
kind of thing will be really helpful

551
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,100
um and then obviously that guy was pop

552
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
10

553
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,039
being familiar with things like that

554
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,080
really helpful

555
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,140
and then uh the likes of YouTube and

556
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,419
twitch so there are some streamers who

557
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,400
do much better the job that they be and

558
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
are way better than I am

559
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,320
um if you want to uh

560
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
find out who they are please let me know

561
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,159
I'll send you a list

562
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,799
um I can't remember them off hand and I

563
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,840
don't want to watch it but yeah they're

564
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,100
a few out there who do an awesome job so

565
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,720
twitch especially

566
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,700
um have many active ones

567
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,159
um unfortunately it doesn't have a cyber

568
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,880
security topic yet there's a request to

569
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,200
put out there it'll be a lot easier if

570
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,980
it was but yeah

571
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,039
and then looks so it's kind of going old

572
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,179
school

573
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,640
um this is very much going to be a a

574
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,820
personal preference I don't I can't do

575
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,240
ebooks I've tried it so many times

576
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,299
um I prefer the flipping look old school

577
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,740
book but

578
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,960
it doesn't matter whether it's ebook or

579
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,299
old school book there are good they're

580
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,740
also really good if you want to

581
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,740
reference them I found myself doing that

582
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,860
quite often if you need to go back do

583
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,659
something looks a lot easier to

584
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,000
reference than some

585
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,679
for instance PowerPoint slide or

586
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,780
something like that

587
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,419
and then kind of the last one that you

588
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,580
can get in terms of

589
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,520
training material top related is blogs

590
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,900
personal blogs

591
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,659
I think these are really really useful

592
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,539
because they give a personal account of

593
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,539
a topic they give a personal in Insight

594
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,760
so some things that someone may have

595
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,039
offers some of the difficulties some of

596
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,020
the do's some of the don'ts

597
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,940
um and that can save you a lot of time

598
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,679
if you're going to try something you

599
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,419
might go down a rabbit hole someone who

600
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,159
might have already done that and that

601
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,299
can save you a lot of time and

602
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,520
frustration as well as learning new

603
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,179
things as well as being free again

604
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,940
another good thing to do is read up on

605
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,220
security findings so people who've done

606
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,539
research

607
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,520
how did they find it what did they learn

608
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,159
what approach did they take because a

609
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,480
lot of that stuff you can use for

610
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,659
yourself

611
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,120
this one I think is also really

612
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,860
important

613
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,520
um

614
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,280
I've personally seen the value out of

615
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,539
this

616
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,039
um so Twitter uh yeah especially the

617
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,260
last few months weeks there's been a lot

618
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,140
of controversy around it but putting

619
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,220
that aside

620
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,760
um I was mro for numerous years kind of

621
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,500
had a stagnant point where I was like

622
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,000
whoa what's going on I'm not really

623
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,159
gaining anything out of it I joined

624
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,860
Twitter things change significantly from

625
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,720
there so again I think it's a tool right

626
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,520
um it depends how you use that tool if

627
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,679
you're using it to spread pattern

628
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,320
whatever you're not going to gain out of

629
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,059
it but if you're engaging with people

630
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,419
communicating people sharing ideas

631
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,279
gaining ideas all that kind of thing it

632
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,159
is a really really useful tool it's also

633
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,380
a really useful tool to stay up to date

634
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,840
see what's trending seeing what new

635
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,720
things are so new technologies new

636
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,059
threats vulnerabilities

637
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,940
I found out about the likes of log4j

638
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,980
through Twitter before I even saw it in

639
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,559
the news so they they that's a really

640
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,179
really good tool as well as the

641
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,340
networking side I mean the script done

642
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,919
yeah uh pretty much all through Twitter

643
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,000
right

644
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,860
um I've got numerous jobs through

645
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,080
Twitter so as you can see it's a really

646
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,120
useful tool as long as you use it in the

647
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,919
right way and the same would go for

648
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,260
mustard and

649
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,299
um and then other ways that you can do

650
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,820
networking as as you all hear today is

651
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,400
through events like this so

652
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,700
thankfully we we're back into inhuman

653
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,340
flesh real flash conferences this is

654
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,600
awesome

655
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,900
um it's a lot easier to network with the

656
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,380
real in-person conferences rather than

657
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,940
online because online saw me just

658
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,520
listening and then you go away so it's

659
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,039
great to see them back in in action

660
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,380
and then finally there are local

661
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,039
chapters so ospav local chapters

662
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,679
um Defcon have local chapters so this is

663
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,539
again a really good way to meet

664
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,820
sometimes those are maybe even better in

665
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,279
some aspects because it's a lot smaller

666
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,900
um so it's easier to meet different

667
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,340
people

668
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,240
um yeah

669
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,700
so I

670
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,760
the other thing I think should touch on

671
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,200
if you if you're going to go into a

672
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,520
career

673
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,039
um there's two types of skills that you

674
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,620
essentially need and I learned this very

675
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,380
early on in my career my boss sat down

676
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,480
with me one day and said Sean your

677
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,520
technical skills are great your soft

678
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,900
skills

679
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,320
yeah you're gonna need to work on those

680
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,760
um and that's stuck with me ever since

681
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,880
like this is really important so

682
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,419
uh we most of us are

683
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,360
fixated on attack love Tech all that I

684
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,000
certainly I am on myself so it's easy to

685
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,039
forget the the soft skills that you need

686
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,260
and personal skills I mean things like

687
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,000
interaction with other people your

688
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,980
communication

689
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,860
um to even how you treat people

690
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,779
um how you help other people and all

691
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,380
that that's really really important

692
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,320
um so as I said when I learned my career

693
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,779
I had no idea what I was doing I

694
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,640
um I thought I was doing the right thing

695
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,440
and I turned out I wasn't

696
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,360
um and I learned from that I'm slow

697
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,580
learning I manage people I did things

698
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,400
probably not the best way possible again

699
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,659
learning from that so it's important to

700
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,940
make sure that load up your technical

701
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,220
skills but also make sure that you build

702
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,080
up your soft skills

703
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
and again there's probably a load of

704
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
online resources from YouTube to blog

705
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,020
posts and all that on this

706
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,299
and then

707
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,640
to do is give back

708
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,520
so this is something that I I'm really

709
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,159
passionate about helping others

710
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,140
um

711
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,500
it in a way it kind of feels a bit

712
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,580
selfish when I say you gain out of it

713
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,080
um but that's not the reason why I do it

714
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
I think it's as long as you're doing it

715
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,740
for the right reasons it's fine to say

716
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,539
again out of it

717
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,539
um against great satisfaction seeing

718
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,539
people move up in their careers because

719
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,400
of stuff that are planned to help them

720
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,880
get there

721
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,460
someone in the US get their first proper

722
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,260
cyber security job on the first

723
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,440
interview to me that was like well uh

724
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,299
that really made my day

725
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,220
um I helped someone gain entry into

726
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,679
cyber security uh

727
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,740
the communities of cyber security career

728
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,500
and yeah now they're working at AWS

729
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,620
again those kinds of things make it all

730
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,720
worthwhile and also seeing things like

731
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,460
blog posts and that helping others and

732
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,559
seeing where to go

733
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,960
at the same time so you're helping them

734
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,520
they're gaining from you but you also

735
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
gain out of that so you you learn

736
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,000
different things along the way and this

737
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,980
is probably more towards that the

738
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,200
previous line of softer skills you learn

739
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,980
how to talk to uh people develop empathy

740
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,720
all that kind of stuff which is really

741
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,640
helpful for your career going forward

742
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,380
um

743
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,919
so yeah coming towards the end I think

744
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,240
it's about sums it up it

745
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,279
it's always difficult

746
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:11,940
um

747
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,799
so you need to be confident in your

748
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,159
career like the the way I view this is

749
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,899
like think about it if you're going to

750
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,880
go buy a car from the dealership if

751
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,380
you've got the salesperson being

752
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,100
automated or you know I don't know I

753
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,000
guess

754
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,140
um you're probably not going to buy that

755
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,899
car you need someone being confident but

756
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,220
at the same time you don't want someone

757
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,559
being arrogant so there's always that

758
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,919
that line and it comes back to the slab

759
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,440
where you need to not be afraid to run

760
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,419
up and lower your limits are be

761
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,220
confident about it but be confident

762
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,200
about the things that you do know but

763
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,460
also be modest about it

764
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,980
another really important

765
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,580
so this one to me is kind of rounding up

766
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
but I think it's really important

767
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,679
you're looking after yourself

768
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,279
um

769
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,940
so a lot of this is really overwhelming

770
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,980
um you sometimes bring yourself down so

771
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,260
as I mentioned at the beginning like I

772
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,880
have no idea what I'm doing you've got

773
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,360
all this Deluge I'm not up for the job

774
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,120
why am I here what what am I doing here

775
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,700
and that's like largely imposter

776
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,760
syndrome and and soft out

777
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,980
you're in the road you go high for the

778
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,779
role for a reason

779
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,419
um so view it that way

780
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,200
take this that big Mass amounts and that

781
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,360
you you looking to come so I could break

782
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,520
it down into chunks

783
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,919
um there's quite a few several um

784
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,899
diagrams online that show you like a

785
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,880
staircase going up in the show a massive

786
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
step with someone trying to pull

787
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,419
themselves up to the top and they show

788
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,279
the little steps and someone walking up

789
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,159
kind of that mentality where

790
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,200
breaking it down in smaller pieces will

791
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,840
get you there so and now also then build

792
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,700
up your confidence

793
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,260
um help with things like imposter

794
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,880
syndrome

795
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,799
um and it's also important that you

796
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,240
surround yourself with like the network

797
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,399
and your friends or that in an industry

798
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,279
that you you made maybe not just in an

799
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,279
industry but also outside but it helps

800
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,380
having those in the industry because

801
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,880
then they can relate they can provide

802
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,039
you guidance advice point you in the

803
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,380
right direction

804
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,600
the other thing is burnouts

805
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,500
um

806
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,740
I wish I would listen to my own advice

807
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,520
um

808
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,960
laughs

809
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,679
thankfully I haven't had this

810
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,279
badly yet and I feel keep that way

811
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,980
um but I have come close there are times

812
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,700
where I push myself just to their limits

813
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,440
um and when you're young you're like I'm

814
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,419
a better I know everything

815
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,760
um and as you get older you like yeah

816
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,320
don't

817
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,659
um it's really important that you pace

818
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:55,559
yourself

819
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,580
have time for your own Hobbies so

820
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,919
recently I got back into photography

821
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,659
it's one of the best decisions I've made

822
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,679
I'm a bank manager disagrees with me but

823
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,140
um it it's really important that you you

824
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,899
get a hobby and

825
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,059
I know sometimes people say oh get away

826
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,220
from the computer screen you have to

827
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,779
make sure it's not at a computer or not

828
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,700
I don't agree with that

829
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,279
what I think is important is you get a

830
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,740
hobby that you enjoy doing that helps

831
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,299
you relax

832
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,539
get away from whatever your ordinary day

833
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,059
job is so if it's sitting in front of a

834
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,860
computer playing games or sitting in

835
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,659
front of a computer doing research and

836
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,840
it makes you happy why not

837
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,480
um obviously have a healthy diet get up

838
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,700
get some sunshine and that but the

839
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,340
important thing is get something that

840
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,779
will just get you away from everything

841
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,480
for a bit this is something that I

842
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,720
didn't do and regret it but tackling it

843
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,419
now because it does catch up to you may

844
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,519
not catch up to you in a year's time or

845
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,440
two years but eventually will catch up

846
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,799
to you

847
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:09,359
so another thing enjoy the ride

848
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,060
if you view this as a journey

849
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,560
um you

850
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,899
as I said there's a lot to learn there's

851
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,760
a lot to take in

852
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,520
dirt and small steps enjoy it

853
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,460
many of you

854
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,159
assume are leaving University and you've

855
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,699
got a long rights career ahead of you

856
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,020
um I would like to thank him halfway

857
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,820
through my career

858
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,480
um so Arsenal have that view that aslaw

859
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,040
got a lot to learn I'm running on a

860
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,260
daily basis there's a lot of cool

861
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,839
Technologies coming out it's crazy the

862
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:43,918

868
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,980
constantly the day that you stop

869
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,260
learning is probably the day that you

870
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,040
should

871
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,920
