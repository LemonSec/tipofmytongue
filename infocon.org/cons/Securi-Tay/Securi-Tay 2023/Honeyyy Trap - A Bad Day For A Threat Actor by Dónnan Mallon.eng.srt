1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,420
hey guys uh welcome to my talk today so

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,859
yeah we're gonna be going for a party

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,420
pots today

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,340
um just give you a free skin truly I am

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,740
I am a security analyst for NCC

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,960
previously at Quorum cyber although

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,359
interest in forensics and TI I like

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,980
music so well it's going to get

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,140
frequently um briefly participated in

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,939
the CTF called free slots which is quite

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,160
nice little um a search party for

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,980
looking at for real missing people

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,840
um I'm a journal geek I'm movie buff I

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,040
like number

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,800
and just a general uh brief overview of

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,719
wallpaper code MC today so we're going

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,219
to be able to interview what honey Buffs

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,600
are for those that may be familiar with

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,420
them or not and just internal history of

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,800
them because that's kind of where a bit

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
of the importance of

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,100
how their development came about and the

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,420
various types that you may have of them

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,180
and the pen against attackers so why we

25
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,100
actually use them as a detection and

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,840
defense mechanism

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,980
um I'm just showing the demo in action

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,320
and summarizing it off so

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,440
for those who oh that was a spoiler

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
please stop right okay so

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,360
who knows what a Honeypot is right well

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
it's not an actual honey any part it's

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,260
like it's my friend for that one it's

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,880
not the type of Honeypot that Winnie the

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,500
Pooh likes um

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,939
Honeypot is simply a bit of software

37
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,460
like that is used as a failure where

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,040
attackers in and it's like a used for

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,020
the deception through

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,479
detection type tactics so the idea is

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,759
you deceive an attacker but they're also

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,579
able to attack them at the same time as

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,200
a style diagram shows here that you're

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,540
able to only place it inside your own

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,280
maternal network but here we'll place it

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,420
externally as well which is going to a

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,040
bit later but what the purpose of those

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,020
are and it's designed to be attacked

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,600
product and compromise on purpose so

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
like they aren't

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,299
um honey pots are generally government

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,759
machines so anything that it's been to

53
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,140
interact with them

54
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,119
isn't it shouldn't be interact with them

55
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,799
but I'll go into a bit more detail about

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,259
that later as well so the separating

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,360
separate into three primary types so you

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,799
have your honey token your honey service

59
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,959
on your honey system so your honey token

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,000
is mimicking legitimate data so if you

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,959
have a

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,140
spreadsheets and SQL databases and

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,660
things like store passwords on

64
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,220
anything that attacking may think this

65
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,140
is legitimate theater and your honey

66
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,020
service is just anything mimicking to

67
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,160
or SSH server FTP HTTP and name it

68
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,900
instrument to

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,879
show that this service is interactive to

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,340
a point and then finally honey system is

71
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,160
mimicking the actual operating system so

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,500
anything from Windows 10 trying to

73
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,440
communicate the behavior of a Red Hat

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,200
Linux server and but it's not meant to

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
really serve much of the business

76
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
purpose so usually attackers kind of

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,580
avoid that

78
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,840
um

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,860
there's different levels of

80
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,080
interactivity so

81
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,239
um they're separated from low to high so

82
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,700
low is typically your decoy such a

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,260
detection mechanism so they're generally

84
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,140
used for more like the diagram shows he

85
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,519
plays it internally to know where to

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,660
pick up a

87
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,300
intrusions in your networks like an IDs

88
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,360
and there's High Behavior though which

89
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,159
is or high interactivity which is more

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,879
like

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,400
there's gonna be a lot more activity

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
with the attacker so you're going to see

93
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
a lot more

94
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,920
um things trying to be compromised and

95
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
generally it's

96
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,819
people kind of shy away from more of the

97
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,140
higher interactive stuff because they

98
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,180
could be there are the nipples are kind

99
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,239
of a bit of a danger and the times

100
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,879
and and for those that may be a Dota 2

101
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,860
player they're probably the worst thing

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,180
recently

103
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,700
um if you're uh for a Honeypot you

104
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,620
recently valversely banned by 40 000

105
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
players just because of Honeypot they

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,680
deployed when they're updating their

107
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,959
software so they allowed for anything

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,420
that match some of the software like a

109
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,239
sort of the cheats

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,760
found them based on that signature

111
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,099
so oh

112
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,560
foundation so now that we've kind of

113
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,180
discussed what a Honeypot is we're going

114
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,319
to go go way back to its history so

115
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,840
um honeypots started all the way back in

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,939
the 1980s

117
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,400
um and cliffs like my uncle cliffstool

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,620
who to this day has been classed as an

119
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,418
early Pioneer

120
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,940
um of learning what uh

121
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,639
anyone's interested in the general story

122
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,979
was that Cliff was a an astronomer at

123
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,080
the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory he

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,460
generally was helping maintain the

125
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,199
computer systems of her school

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,199
so one night Cliff noticed that 75 cents

127
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,580
of the computer's time was being used up

128
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,199
with uh Point review in the accounting

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,479
firm so generally this is the time when

130
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,060
a dial better was a bit of a thing for

131
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,680
those that had to experience it uh I

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,020
know I did grow it up uh that was a lot

133
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,220
of money

134
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,320
and so

135
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,820
Cliff noticed that he couldn't

136
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,340
specifically specify to One Singular

137
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,520
user and further investigation led to

138
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,740
the laboratory was under attack

139
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,180
so klept aside clef was you able to use

140
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,340
security monitoring tools and by the

141
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,259
help of other tactics to set up alerts

142
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,580
when the attacker connected to the

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,600
network

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,940
and upon that point uh Cliff was able to

145
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,979
help with the help of

146
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,120
um

147
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,620
home companies

148
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,780
at the time and communicate exactly

149
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,340
where the attacker was coming from trace

150
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,520
the Callback to Germany uh but the

151
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
problem was though that they weren't

152
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
able to exactly pinpoint the same

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
location that the cliff needed to so

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,360
that would require on-site maintenance

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
from other engineers and typically this

156
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
would take ours and ours longer than any

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,340
normal attacker session go but

158
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,979
so Cliff kind of got frustrated but he

159
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,180
decided to dive deeper into what uh

160
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,000
trying to pick up the attacker so he

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,280
developed developed the idea of giving

162
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,660
you the very first honey buff from the

163
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,180
helpless partner called the sdni project

164
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,120
so that was a fake missile defense

165
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,660
system and he devised based on the

166
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,100
research and what the attack was kind of

167
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,900
looking for because they were employing

168
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,360
vulnerabilities on using the laboratory

169
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,820
as a pivot point to Target U.S

170
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,660
governments and Military targets

171
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,479
so Cliff is able to put legit like fake

172
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,139
files on it and

173
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,259
um

174
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,139
I'll be able to

175
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,120
blur the attacker in keep them there

176
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,819
long enough so that um

177
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,319
they're able to keep track of it so

178
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,419
not only are there and Cliff was able to

179
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,520
find the help with law enforcement on

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
the attacker so moving on from out there

181
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,440
we're going into the late 90s or early

182
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,639
90s sorry

183
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,440
um Phil Cheswick created a series of

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,259
custom built the economy class servers

185
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,479
services that carried a variety of

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,720
services HTTP history SSH name it and he

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,919
was able to mimic like certain notable

188
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,340
deep error debug or bugs let's say um

189
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,139
STP SMTP and allow it for

190
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,479
and being able to lower the attacker in

191
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,520
based on what their behavior was into a

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,319
prison cell type environment

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,440
and from there Phil was able to learn

194
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,180
exactly what the attacker was doing

195
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,060
vulnerability wise so throwing he was

196
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,099
able to like see that he's targeting

197
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,840
certain vulnerabilities and with her

198
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,819
help out there essentially this is the

199
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,940
aspect where not only the Honeypot Carry

200
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,280
On from IDs point of view but for more

201
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,680
research she'll go into a bit more later

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,539
and this kind of this Behavior kind of

203
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,880
came apart more with the um

204
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,699
the pony project which is like carried

205
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,620
up by a group of researchers to this day

206
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,660
it's still an ongoing thing

207
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,240
and they lied for um

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
a devising honeypots into two different

209
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,400
section or categories so you have your

210
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,880
production which is generally your decoy

211
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,220
IDs and research which is just learn

212
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,400
about what the attackers do

213
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,440
bonds the general tactics

214
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,599
but the problem the thing they noticed

215
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,919
though was that because this was the

216
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
journey each of the worm and the rise of

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
the malware it came apart the shift from

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
uh General detection for honeypots moved

219
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,000
away and research became the focal point

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,860
so they were able to learn a lot more

221
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,440
about exactly what kind of

222
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,080
um attack traffic the attackers or

223
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Commerce carrying

224
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,380
um kind of normally the present day

225
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,419
there is a lot more

226
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,420
um for organizations but back in the day

227
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,800
um during Cliff's time they weren't

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
really exactly the most ideal thing

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,399
to be used on and people were scared of

230
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,440
like highway or Heist needed or would it

231
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,580
be able to like you know let the

232
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,320
attacker be able to compromise it or use

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,180
against us all those questions came

234
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,820
apart um but it's a bit more and

235
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,620
accepted

236
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,620
so how many parts convert to fully

237
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,779
formal categories like I mentioned so

238
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,100
first you have your research which is

239
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
gathering inside the attackers tools

240
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,180
tactics and procedures and useful for

241
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,620
when you need like the kind of gather an

242
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,660
ioc fee I've had that personally as a

243
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,120
working in any stock that I've seen a

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,060
customer use a high pucker such a

245
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,519
purpose and you just easily see a ton of

246
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,339
alerts just hit that one box

247
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,740
but then secondly your production which

248
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,380
is usually a decoy system so learning

249
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,720
what exactly the when the attacker is

250
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,279
about to connect be able to like get

251
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,459
alarms sent to you notifications wise

252
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,040
um this normally uses the same

253
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
concerned concern yourself for not only

254
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,339
external spreads you may also have

255
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,019
Insider threads so

256
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,680
learn exactly uh

257
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,019
you may have in insiders within your

258
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,399
organizations that may be disgruntled

259
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,019
employees and for various different

260
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,120
reasons so you mean it may need to like

261
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,339
deploy honeypots in the certain bits of

262
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,380
your networks that way and you're able

263
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,180
to pick on Behavior but the problem is

264
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
though is that you may need a keypad um

265
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,940
more of a hush hush ordeal so that

266
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,500
um not only a certain number of teams

267
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,880
may know by his awareness because

268
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,740
otherwise if you let

269
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,779
um people know about where the honeypots

270
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,760
are it defeats the purpose of exactly

271
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
why I was employed in the first place

272
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,779
uh just like a little bit Runner thing

273
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,779
the idea was a you were able to deceive

274
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,000
exactly well I believe one thing but it

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,279
was the other it's much like a later on

276
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,620
there to be able to perceive that like

277
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,480
people thought they were human but in

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,700
terms of their Androids

279
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,519
and these are just a few examples of

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,279
honeypots so calories along we're going

281
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,620
to go into a bit later is a Honeypot

282
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,320
that I set up for a demo and the biggest

283
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,540
Canary which is a service that I've I've

284
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,579
used at a stock it's a really really

285
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,540
cool service

286
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,339
um they help deploy like different like

287
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,339
the canary tokens about your way and

288
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,720
this is this is just not the sales pitch

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,100
by the way I just I do find them quite

290
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,579
interested and they they're like able to

291
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,040
log not only exactly when there might be

292
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,860
unauthorized logins or

293
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,540
um attempts into different sections of

294
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,220
where you might place your tokens it's a

295
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,560
good way box you see exactly

296
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,540
what kind of activity is going on in

297
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,100
your network and then here's just a few

298
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,480
open source honeypots that I got from a

299
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
couple cat Hub which I've linked to you

300
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,079
later on so like you know you've got VW

301
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,040
part which is like your Superior levels

302
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,519
USB for Empower and Honeypot camera

303
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,560
name it reflects so much more that you

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,820
can like kind of mess starting with it's

305
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,710
just very much open source

306
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,940
[Music]

307
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,760
and I'm moving on from up there we'll

308
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
learn about defend against threats so

309
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
why does an organization benefit from

310
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,480
well

311
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
we learned that it's helping it's

312
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,860
helpful for early detections such as

313
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,140
like you know acting as a tripwire and

314
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,240
be able to lie and faster response time

315
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,760
so typically for my own experience it

316
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,500
can air like likes as thick as canaries

317
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,480
they do trigger quite fast and they

318
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,339
alert like you know your scene tool or

319
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,279
other forms of um integration you may

320
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,800
have for quite a flat 12th out there a

321
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,660
resource site they don't require a lot

322
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,640
of Maintenance this is quite handy when

323
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,140
you may have to serve like a business

324
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,920
need or purpose

325
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,600
exactly you know they could be using

326
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,980
credentials so what kind of passwords

327
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,420
they're using like does it look like as

328
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,420
a corporate and username or um passwords

329
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,920
like kind of match up exactly if there's

330
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,839
like you know maintenance or someone's

331
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,940
trying to like these things Anna has

332
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,040
lost full of positive the reason I put

333
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
the asterisks there is that in

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,459
vulnerability scanners are known to

335
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,920
trigger these off so typically when you

336
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,320
do employ honeypots it's best to kind of

337
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,920
get your sensors such as I am

338
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,899
the founder of identities I have scanner

339
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,459
to get whitelisted or uh

340
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,079
any known of vulnerable scars to

341
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,180
carinoid so wait it avoids just

342
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,920
triggering them because they do fire off

343
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,779
when they're like get in trouble

344
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,600
and that helps when like I mentioned if

345
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,339
honey pots abort machines so they don't

346
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,300
get poked on unless they are interacted

347
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,920
with some purpose so when they do your

348
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,660
work you have to pretty much react

349
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,260
immediately like it's like their nature

350
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,440
and moving on from Mark we get to the

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,540
threat actors nightmare so there's a

352
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,459
number of things that kind of can make

353
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,240
it a an actor say a bad so honeypot's

354
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,279
free frustration

355
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,380
um they may be trying to set themselves

356
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,300
a goal and particularly with time as

357
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,160
well because time is a necessity for

358
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,019
when they're trying to move a boy and

359
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,980
probably achievable so when not only are

360
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,720
they

361
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
felt the Honeypot that may use up the

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,019
resources it creates a lot of

363
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,760
frustration it may end up leaving or

364
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,740
they may keep trying trying to do it so

365
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,620
like a build it you'll be able to create

366
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,760
a

367
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,980
a prison-like environment

368
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,560
um which couldn't be compromised or

369
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
um

370
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,760
in fact other bits of the system

371
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,800
so allies for um

372
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,480
you just mess around with the attacker

373
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
and just generally annoy them until they

374
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
go away and perceiving them so the art

375
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,180
of perception is a profiling thing with

376
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,500
honeypots you need to make sure like

377
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,060
exactly how you're trying to deceive

378
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,440
them

379
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,680
so it could be anything from

380
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,380
High you place the Honeypot exactly what

381
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,899
it's trying to do and

382
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,940
what it's and what your goal is trying

383
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,880
to see when it alerts so

384
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,360
yeah that's generally a good thing for

385
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,820
um reducing 12 time as well so your your

386
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,019
attacker could already be in at this

387
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,040
point

388
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,660
it could be hopping from one bit to the

389
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,800
other

390
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
um on Honeypot can be placed in such a

391
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,699
way like if the number of Honey pops

392
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:45,779
your network

393
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,199
and audio clock can pick up

394
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,899
llif4 and the only spot the attacker in

395
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,519
the trucks but it could also cut down

396
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,100
when whether whether or the right at the

397
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,899
start or they're right in the middle

398
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,180
you'll be able to just cast in there and

399
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,300
just isolate or lock them whatever they

400
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,779
were coming from

401
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,779
know when they're in a Honeypot

402
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,940
but my point that you're able to see

403
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,399
them there it's too late so they could

404
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,680
already know oh this is a Honeypot but

405
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,019
we leave our exploding so we were let's

406
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,760
just kind of like straight away

407
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,100
and moving on from up there I'm going to

408
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,360
show you a Honeypot in action so

409
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,459
um the Honeypot we're going over today

410
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,579
is calorie so this is designed to mimic

411
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,620
the interactivity of Associates on

412
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,540
telnet

413
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,339
um it's a medium to high interaction

414
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,940
type uh honey bun so use like log Brute

415
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,440
Force attempts and shell commands the

416
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,420
episode could be doing

417
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,579
um and medium interaction mode in the

418
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,160
interaction Unix environment and Python

419
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,899
and then in high interactions it

420
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,500
functions as an SSH and telnet proxy

421
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,399
and it can also be used to help analyze

422
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,300
malware when traffic is quite a

423
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,720
for this demo I did keep a basic but and

424
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,459
you are able to deal a lot more of it

425
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,959
which I will go into a bit

426
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,899
let's see if this works

427
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,899
I've got a backup so it'll be all good

428
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,959
all right

429
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,639
it's God damn

430
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,599
it

431
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,860
okay

432
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,679
[Music]

433
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,679
[Music]

434
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,819
but this doesn't break

435
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,240
what happened

436
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,439
[Music]

437
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,799
oh wait never mind I opened the room

438
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,799
this was just the test one yeah there

439
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
was

440
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,980
mm-hmm

441
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,700
there we go

442
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,000
there we go

443
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,650
[Music]

444
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,619
[Music]

445
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,980
[Music]

446
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,820
okay uh so I was just testing earlier

447
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,880
just to make sure

448
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,780
okay

449
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,059
yeah so at this point we've already set

450
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,280
up the

451
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,660
so that's my we've already set up the

452
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,480
Honey Pop on this should be able to

453
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,760
so this here will help you initiate the

454
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,860
virtual environment so a German setup I

455
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,840
created a second user called calorie

456
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
this helps with all the back end stuff

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,340
when you're to set up the honeybub and

458
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,660
at the point when that once it's set up

459
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,100
that this will help initiate the virtual

460
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,780
environment for the Honeypot story it

461
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,760
runs in the background and this helps

462
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,100
kick start it as well so that way I

463
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,419
don't have to worry about going into the

464
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,320
user

465
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,500
and here we have our log source so this

466
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,179
is where we'll be able to get all the

467
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,960
logs for when any uh activity carries

468
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,520
out

469
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,340
so if anything like you know suspicious

470
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
happens wise this is where you'll be

471
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,760
able to find it in this folder

472
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,179
so if I attempted to say log in to the

473
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,880
machine but

474
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,100
field

475
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
bam

476
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,240
or field and we checked our logs

477
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,380
able to see

478
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,340
able to see not only

479
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
um

480
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,620
maybe you'll see it there but we will

481
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,860
see like um the password temp of the uh

482
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,539
the copper try to carry out so this is

483
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,220
the funny part here and the Cali would

484
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,679
be the attacker and coming in so this

485
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,720
would log not only the password but the

486
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,900
user does well the IP came from and the

487
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,880
timestamp the activity took place so in

488
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,440
terms of like if you were monitoring the

489
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
saw these bits of information are

490
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,380
important when you're trying to carry a

491
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,600
communicate with a customer any little

492
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,520
bit of information helps when you're

493
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,780
trying to say like oh that looks like

494
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,100
this is a suspicious activity you might

495
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,600
want to look at it immediately kick the

496
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,959
person out

497
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,460
um and again you know full further field

498
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,340
attempts before the connection gets lost

499
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,539
so what if the attacker

500
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:36,200
was successful in logging in

501
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,010
please don't fight me

502
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,980

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,720
I had so many troubleshooting she's

504
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,299
really oh honestly

505
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,299
uh

506
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,400
uh

507
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
fight me

508
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,120
should have it work right

509
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,220
um okay well a good thing I've recorded

510
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,179
this

511
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,510
so

512
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,220
[Music]

513
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,179
all right so let me troubleshooting here

514
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,059
errors with this um

515
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,659
so right like I've explained and this is

516
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,100
a demo I just recorded as a backup

517
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,220
thankfully and so as I went over

518
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,240
um this universe environment

519
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,159
kickstarting the Honeypot and this is

520
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,500
your log Source here so should we

521
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,220
um

522
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,820
so

523
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,260
it doesn't seem to

524
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,940
doesn't seem to like it when I've

525
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,380
what's that applied

526
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,360
so like I said like this is like a

527
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,460
talker error this is what the uh looked

528
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,140
like I was kind of like blogging as an

529
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,059
unauthorized user

530
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,200
um

531
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,659
kind of number of like attempts and you

532
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,280
can do a little more with them

533
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,320
calories so we can create they make a

534
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
full-on file system with the the pickle

535
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,100
yeah

536
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,620
file system and outlines for like you

537
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,320
know to make the what would look to be

538
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,000
like you know SSH slick server more

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,740
interactive so that way the attacker

540
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,299
doesn't need to know this is a Honeypot

541
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,340
uh not only can you get up there but you

542
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,280
can also um store like fake passwords as

543
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,120
well so if they're trying to like

544
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,500
exfiltrate it or

545
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,320
Mariana means a user to carry a lot of

546
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,600
things you will see all that activity as

547
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,840
well

548
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,919
so

549
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,919
when the attacker would be successfully

550
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
logging into the

551
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,780
thing be able to see not only is that

552
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,260
the server there

553
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,880
and this is the shell commands that the

554
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,260
attacker will carry axle again it's just

555
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,440
a basic thing to show you the concept

556
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,140
it's the same thing that taco was trying

557
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,200
to create new files or maybe run scripts

558
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,860
and yeah

559
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,200
Not only would you be able to see in

560
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
doing this

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,419
well it gives you General sense of

562
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,400
give you General sense exactly of what

563
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,780
the attacker is trying to achieve so

564
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,200
like the history shows us the a lot of

565
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,460
the um

566
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,500
early adopters of using honeypots to use

567
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
this to learn Excel people like the

568
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,380
attackers financing

569
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,480
so again this is just an example showing

570
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
you this is all walking in here in the

571
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,640
same IP I'm starting life

572
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,280
and not only out there it helps you kind

573
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,380
of discover exactly what their motives

574
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,640
and what they're trying to like you know

575
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,500
achieve

576
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,240
and let's let's get let's have to go a

577
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,740
long way and when

578
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,380
all these honey pots as the deception

579
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,200
tool but detecting it but is he um

580
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,240
when either it's you know in the middle

581
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,140
or at the beginning for example

582
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,460
that's generally the idea of it and

583
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,080
just a kind of just an overall summary

584
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,940
you learn what the honeypots are and

585
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,580
what the onboard history of them is how

586
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,720
you can use like many different

587
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,700
polyposterone advantage

588
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,919
and the importance of having other forms

589
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
of detection so you know honeypots

590
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,240
aren't like like a silver bullet you

591
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,039
need you need other things on top of

592
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,140
that but having an extra layer of

593
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,419
detection on protection helps a long way

594
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,220
for your own business or like you know

595
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,020
money service provider

596
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,940
um and also finally ability to gather

597
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,059
intelligence on the officer so with a

598
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,460
little um request for David

599
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,260
I put it

600
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,260
on them yeah just shout out to Dave

601
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,820
McKenzie for helping me with some

602
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,799
pointers on this year especially uh

603
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,419
Chris Sanders as well for his intrigued

604
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,280
in the technology book that helped the

605
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,539
big time with history because I was

606
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,820
trying to pinpoint exactly what a.m

607
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,919
it'll start it and that book it was just

608
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,960
been a massive help and a list of Honey

609
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,000
Pop as well that I mentioned as well

610
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,860
because they're all um on there that

611
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,419
most majority of them are open source

612
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,179
farther somewhere and and just like to

613
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,740
power as well

614
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,679
and finally a shout out to Anna and Elmo

615
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,600
for helping me practice talks thank you

616
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,620
very much

617
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,939
um yep any questions

618
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,740
thank you

619
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,500
any other questions just

620
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,220
what's most interesting

621
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,140
interesting thing I find

622
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,539
um

623
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,580
yeah I mean like I said how are you was

624
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,919
like um coinciding with other forms of

625
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
detection to pick up uh malware traffic

626
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,659
so I was like uh that was a bit of an

627
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,279
interesting one to actually see and not

628
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,919
only is it like a nice little

629
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,140
um configurable Honey Pop

630
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,059
you could do so much for to actually

631
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,980
make it look so real so like that goes

632
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,140
back to like the different types of

633
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,120
interaction and

634
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,100
generally how you deceive the attacker

635
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,539
so

636
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,360
your goal is to make sure the attacker

637
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,340
doesn't know it's a high part yet until

638
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,860
when whether it's too late or too soon I

639
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,480
mean you want them to trigger it so that

640
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,799
way you're able to point pinpoint

641
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
exactly where where they are and maybe

642
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,580
what they're doing

643
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,440
um with power reaction you can actually

644
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,880
create a prison environment and actually

645
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,679
just trap the mirror and just spin up in

646
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,960
instance each time just like infuriating

647
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,400
them to the point where they just want

648
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,700
to leave so that's a good way when

649
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,559
wasting resources around but it doesn't

650
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,179
really affect you that much

651
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,460
and Germany because this is like a low

652
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,480
medium to like um High interaction

653
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,740
Dependable blade I deploy this of course

654
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,140
I mean it won't

655
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,020
really do much damage I mean the pen of

656
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,100
course like you don't want High

657
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
interaction honeypots with your network

658
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,640
because otherwise if it's compromised it

659
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,380
could be used

660
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,279
as a um form of

661
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,539
uh attacking

662
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:35,220
emails yeah

663
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,560
um

664
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,380
[Music]

665
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,659
yeah yeah actually yeah you see that

666
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,120
yeah well obviously real time but yeah I

667
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,580
know what sound we got there we're like

668
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,200
we got like one time I was like was

669
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,100
working

670
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,480
um like currently actually my socket

671
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,559
well um someone was uh performing

672
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,120
like you know a lot of logins on it you

673
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,440
can still see it actually carry it out

674
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,820
it's all the panel where it logs because

675
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,980
you can't get Pony Pops real time but

676
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,419
like you know like some Canary tokens

677
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,500
they do

678
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,120
they'll trigger a number of alerts for

679
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,200
the same thing and then it'll kind of

680
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,059
update it almost but you'll see like a

681
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,500
whole list of like passwords and stuff

682
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
and it turns out just you know someone

683
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,640
from the IT team was just kind of

684
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,200
Maintenance so but at the end of the day

685
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,659
the Honeypot shouldn't trigger so you

686
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,340
should raise them like regardless of

687
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,840
what it is she looks just so worth it's

688
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,260
like you know some Fender scanner you

689
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,158
just yeah

690
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,919
you know hang out do you think there's

691
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,760
evaluated

692
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,400
things like chat

693
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,200
you can tell GPT to build a honey bun

694
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
yeah

695
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,580
no yeah I think it's like I think

696
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,480
there's potential I think there's

697
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,799
actually iconic Bots to actually deal

698
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,299
with it

699
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,559
um

700
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,658
uh actually I'm trying to see

701
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,779
there's just like you oh it's not even

702
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,260
showing it

703
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,179
I don't know why it's not sure

704
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,580
so this is like the list of like

705
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,679
honeypots that actually I was able to

706
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:35,940
come across

707
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,919
so like there's just like array of like

708
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,899
what they can be used for and even tell

709
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:40,919
you so I think there's actually some

710
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,440
machine learning ones on there

711
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,299
um as far as I'm aware

712
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,500
um

713
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,779
I thought the website right there was a

714
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,320
