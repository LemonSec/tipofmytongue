1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,100
thank you okay

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm actually surprised it's just really

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,820
showed up with a song uh so my name is

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,960
Richard Ellis I'm a director of a

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,759
company called risk group he worked out

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,039
in London and we're a cyber security

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,140
consultancy we do everything from pen

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,000
testing all the way through to things

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
like compliance to ISO and gdpr

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,279
we do everything except sell products

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,599
essentially

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,760
okay this isn't going to be a typical

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,579
presentation I actually have second

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,200
thoughts about in terms of delivering it

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,739
to an academic crowd uh it's a you know

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,960
for someone I should say grumpy old man

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,480
alerts uh obviously the point of this

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,040
presentation is you guys are about to

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,920
embark on a on a on a career in cyber

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,840
security I've actually been doing it for

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,899
30 years and there's good news and

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,940
there's bad news and uh but at the end

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,820
of the day I'm an old man who spent 25

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,360
30 years in this profession and I'm

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,860
starting to look around and see things

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,080
that I don't like okay and if I were you

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,840
I'd like to know these things I I

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,280
actually originally did this

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,159
presentation and over I saw the Europe

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,460
conference last fall uh and which is all

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,939
season cesos and Auditors and when I was

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,680
done you could hear a pin drop

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,659
and not the good way

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,979
um so it's a lot of attitude here but I

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,140
left it in there purposely there's a lot

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,180
of what I would have loved to have been

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,880
told or if I was your age starting out

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,500
in this kind of profession

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm taking for what it's worth

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,960
um but uh you know I I do feel like it

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,119
potentially to say yeah I'm an old guy

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,460
and I've I might come across as a little

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,479
grumpy

44
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,360
I dedicate this presentation to Mr

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,939
mattioli Mr mattioli was a guy in my

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,399
neighborhood that uh he lived about four

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,340
or five I grew up in what it's called I

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,079
guess a state house and all the yards

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,820
were together they weren't separated by

50
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,520
fences but God forbid if your ball went

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,920
into Mr Magi oldies yard it would not

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,680
allow you to step on this grass you'd

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,419
have to go and knock on his door and ask

54
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,220
for your ball back and he'd make you

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
wait for it you know this is and see Mr

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,060
Mani only was one of our neighborhood

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,819
was drunk he was our neighborhood garage

58
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,980
he sit in his you know in his dark and

59
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
living room and listened to a baseball

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,300
game and drink beer and he was

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,160
unemployed and he was a steel worker who

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,680
was laid off all right so he you know

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,440
the point was everybody you did not just

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
jump who walked through and assume

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,819
things with Mr Mallu maybe go knock on

66
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,980
the screen door ask for your ball back

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,680
and anyway I remember asking my mom you

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,900
know what's why is he such a jerk why is

69
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,940
Mr Maddie only such a grouch and she

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,680
just called told me that he's going to

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,900
lay off after a lot of time in his

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,060
profession as a welder and he's just a

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,620
little disappointed with the way his

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,660
professional legs turned out

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't say that's me I said that maybe

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,860
as I get older I'm starting to feel a

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,099
lot like Mr mattioli and uh when I gave

78
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,120
this that I saw because somebody

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
actually came up to me and said You Know

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,459
Rich and they know me for 25 30 years

81
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,860
and so Richard you we are coming across

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
as a little grumpy and I thought it was

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,420
so maddio and I said yeah

84
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,159
I think I'd look around at my profession

85
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,580
after 25 30 years and I'm not happy I

86
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,080
think there's evidence that it's not

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,340
working

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,040
simple evidence now the material is

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,540
based on if you're running a business

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,120
and you're buying products and services

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,239
and your thing or CSO in the market who

92
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,980
is spending year after year spending

93
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,840
more more and more money and not seeing

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,459
any results

95
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,140
and I think there's a simple reason for

96
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,459
that I think there's some fundamental

97
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,580
design uh deficiencies in the way the

98
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,500
industry is structured and the evidence

99
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,180
is sitting right there but we don't

100
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,440
question it

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
and and that's what I'm out today is to

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
give that perspective okay and for me I

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,819
the best advice I ever heard is I you

104
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,799
know I do I think the cyber security

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,739
industry has a problem and the very

106
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,420
first step in solving any problem is to

107
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,159
recognize that there is one

108
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,860
and that's my goal today is maybe just

109
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,360
maybe have you look at the cyber

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
security industry and say maybe there's

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,799
a problem and as you go through your

112
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,900
careers I dress that problem head-on

113
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,639
because I wish I would have had this

114
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,918
information when I was your age stepping

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,139
off into my career

116
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,000
all right that sounds negative already

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,540
doesn't it that's for me okay uh I've

118
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,520
got about three hours worth of material

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
uh that's bad news uh good news is I'm

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
an American we talk really fast that's

121
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,139
bad news for you good news for me

122
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,699
because I could get this thing done in

123
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,820
12 minutes it's Alan Jackson as I always

124
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,360
am so um if I speak too fast if you want

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,860
to give another if you want to hear an

126
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,479
example I don't want a presentation

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
around a workshop you got something to

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,860
say yell it out throw something at me uh

129
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,240
make a point please

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,520
um Okay so

131
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,100
yeah I got a problem I don't think the

132
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,620
cyber security industry is currently

133
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,860
working as currently designed works all

134
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,419
right if you believe that the

135
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,740
fundamental reason that the cyber

136
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,020
security industry exists is to stop

137
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,419
systems from being breached and the stop

138
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,800
data loss

139
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,380
and I do yeah you know ask yourself

140
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,780
what's the point of the industry stop

141
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,060
systems from being broken into from

142
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,400
unauthorized access and and stop

143
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,680
unauthorized data breaches the release

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
of material right is not what we're all

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
about

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,300
that's our Focus that's our objective

147
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,820
that's our goal that's my goal as a

148
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,500
information security consultant for the

149
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,240
last 30 years who go in there whether it

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,340
was cyber and doing pen tests or doing

151
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,160
ISO compliance my goal is to ensure that

152
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,039
systems were secure and data was not

153
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,180
lost

154
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,220
right that's the point of securing the

155
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,580
systems is to is to prevent the data on

156
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,020
there the sensitive data from being lost

157
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,940
right that's the objective

158
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,979
so I'm here telling you if that's our

159
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,720
objective as an industry

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,280
we're failing

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,800
we're clearly failing

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,220
and you know for me

163
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,979
first well well let's start I think I

164
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,320
think it's in the the overview just

165
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,960
about two years ago the world economic

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,320
Forum uh added three new top risks to

167
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,840
companies globally all right system

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,660
breaches well lots of those for the data

169
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,479
impact on that and most likely to affect

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
their businesses

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,100
so the world economic Forum now says for

172
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,600
businesses globally

173
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,139
the top 10 risks three of them three of

174
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,419
them are associated to our industry

175
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,979
cyber security

176
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,080
that's 30 percent

177
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
now if you say the industry is 25 years

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,819
old the first virus was the brain

179
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,759
identified in 1986 remember those days

180
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,080
you don't remember those days I was

181
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,600
there in those days dancing to Madonna

182
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,020
and driving to Bruce Springsteen

183
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,940
1986 you know okay fine cyber security

184
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,580
first virus we're off we're 30 years

185
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,919
down the road

186
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,100
and we are now three out of the top 10

187
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
biggest risks they've seen businesses

188
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,759
globally

189
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,800
I got a problem with that that shows

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
that says we're not doing okay that's

191
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,100
our tracker I've been doing this for 30

192
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,440
years we didn't start on that list two

193
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,139
years ago three on top 10 risks are

194
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,000
associated to our Industries your

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,139
industry

196
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,000
the industry you are about to step off

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,620
in

198
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,479
failure to me all right clear clear

199
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,099
clear clear clear sign of failure

200
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:35,520
sorry I get over passionate sometimes

201
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,759
second thing clearly clearly you see the

202
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,479
rise of Regulation gdpr or this uh Nest

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
that missed that when you when you when

204
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,919
the government gets involved and starts

205
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,599
to regulate and say this is what

206
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,120
security is or this is what safety is

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
this is what security is you know it's

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,300
because they have to step in

209
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,819
I got my age I remember back in the 70s

210
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,039
you could in the 60s and the 70s cars

211
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,599
didn't have seat belts for crying out

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,680
loud

213
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,539
you know people are flying through the

214
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,000
windshield you know driving 30 miles an

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,639
hour and thousands of people were dying

216
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,160
because we didn't have airbags or

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,740
anti-lock brakes or shatterproof glass

218
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,860
or forget all that stuff Detroit was

219
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,960
throwing out cars and until the

220
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
government stepped in and regulated

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,180
Airline safety automobile safety uh

222
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,520
energy safety that's because the

223
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,458
industry wasn't doing it themselves they

224
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,700
failed to do it now our industry that's

225
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,740
our objective the security

226
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,719
and you start to see regulation why

227
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,200
because it's not getting done

228
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,020
Agree to Agree I agree to disagree but

229
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,100
you're going to see when the government

230
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,440
steps involved for a guy like me that's

231
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
because the industry is failing

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
yeah

233
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,600
the breaches my God the breaches

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,220
so I got the breaches do you need

235
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,600
statistical data I don't believe in

236
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
reach data I don't I don't I don't

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,060
Advocate it but I don't care where you

238
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,160
look because by the time I'm finished

239
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,399
with this briefing we will have lost on

240
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,380
average three quarters of a million

241
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,720
records

242
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,839
three quarters of a million records

243
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,760
that's okay I know I don't care where

244
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
you go and this is you have to keep in

245
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,140
mind that that statistics like this 14

246
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,959
in the last five years we have lost over

247
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,779
14 billion records

248
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,459
how many people are walking on the

249
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,600
planet

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
this is just went up and it's like you

251
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,300
Billy now

252
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,339
we have lost more than twice the amount

253
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,320
of people that are actually walking on

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,440
the planets

255
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,500
revision will represent your industry my

256
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,620
industry is paid to protect

257
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,959
and now and I also remind you these kind

258
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,519
of numbers come from companies with

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,459
mandatory disclosure laws let's say you

260
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,839
have to raise your hand and you have to

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,060
say you lost data you don't see Chinese

262
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,760
and China data here India did your

263
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,459
Russian data here this is the US and EU

264
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,940
data uh numbers so we've lost twice the

265
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,500
number of records of people there are

266
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,740
now

267
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,019
uh the traffic

268
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,120
you're just starting out and that's

269
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,260
that's what you're looking you're

270
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,060
looking to put you know you're looking

271
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,899
to stop that Trinity

272
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,940
I don't like breaches I don't like to

273
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,580
talk about breaches but you cannot every

274
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
single day we see you know Yahoo three

275
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,440
billion three billion first of all Yahoo

276
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,860
had three billion just subscribers

277
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,360
River City loses the Hat one and a half

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
billion at heart you know a government

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,040
in India credit a billion billion here a

280
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,200
billion here look at the size of these

281
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,820
breaches

282
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,579
this is not you know 20 20 records from

283
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,920
Mom and Pop dot Co dot UK selling

284
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,120
flowers

285
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,339
this is Yahoo and governments that are

286
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,860
losing a billion at a shot he's a

287
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,560
mind-boggling and so you don't you don't

288
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,240
think about it I don't think about it

289
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,519
companies don't think about it

290
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,860
but the people we're looking to protect

291
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,200
the data clearly and you and I are

292
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
working for these people

293
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,540
the numbers alone are overwhelming

294
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,839
evidence

295
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,820
so I try not to think of that

296
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,459
but you have to because

297
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,100
I talked to csos she kind of information

298
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,320
security officers in America here is in

299
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
Richmond spending more money as I'm

300
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
having more breaches that's an inverse

301
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
relationship

302
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,459
my budgets are going up I'm spending

303
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,279
more money and yet year after year you

304
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,860
see I don't care to start nerves yeah

305
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,899
who's you know RSA who's putting out the

306
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,300
statistics your your businesses are

307
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,100
spending more on security and losing

308
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,880
more data

309
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,540
what the

310
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,060
I don't get that how can you do what's

311
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,540
wrong here recognizes for what it is

312
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,300
more money we spend the more data we've

313
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,880
been losing I don't what huh seems like

314
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,380
it should be the more you spend the less

315
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,360
day than you lose

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,940
but work hard on this cycle you know

317
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,740
year after year you're spending more

318
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,440
you're staying more just it's like we're

319
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,519
running to stay in places

320
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,839
we're running and we're making no

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,420
progress whatsoever we are making no

322
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,720
dents into our problem Are We Now if you

323
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,880
look at the numbers

324
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,959
not if you look at what your your

325
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,640
average high speed bank is paying to

326
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,500
secure their data and how many breaches

327
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,019
they have that year not the southern it

328
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,899
just doesn't make sense

329
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,000
any other industry the more you spend to

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,620
solve a problem the more the problem

331
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,120
should go down

332
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,399
that's not it

333
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,220
anybody disagree with that

334
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,560
that's just common sense and I don't

335
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
think it's something we talked about I

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
go to hundreds of these countries I

337
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,660
don't go to academic environments like

338
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,820
this at this point I think at this point

339
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,060
to a room that's more quiet than this

340
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,040
if you can believe that

341
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,019
of people who are paid to deal with this

342
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,820
and they don't seem to just step back

343
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,200
and look at wait a minute was

344
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,040
yeah you're going to try for current a

345
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
lot

346
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,200
you argue that there's more data

347
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,959
sure you could there's a lot of there's

348
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
a lot of variables to this and I'm

349
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,760
simplifying for that reason you know but

350
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,579
I go this is what I do I go into a I go

351
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,560
into any company whether it's Mom and

352
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,459
Pop dot Co dot UK or HSBC you know and

353
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:39,899
say what are you trying to protect why

354
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,860
are you trying to protect it what's

355
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,300
going to happen to you let's say you're

356
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,620
going to try to protect this statement

357
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,899
here's the money we have so usually the

358
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,459
businesses have a focus on what they're

359
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,380
trying to achieve and yes there's more

360
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,300
data and we collect it more ways and you

361
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,040
know Yahoo and governments that are

362
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
collecting data but you know just as you

363
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,260
know your bank my bank you know people

364
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,079
we count on to protect their data

365
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,720
it is losing you and that's the people

366
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,519
we want to protect it obviously people

367
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,100
with networking us and and religious

368
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,680
affiliation and sexual orientation as a

369
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,380
thing about you and I Our Lives now

370
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,639
there's always going to be more of that

371
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,100
and we give away ideas forever that's a

372
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,139
separate subject but I'm saying you guys

373
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,959
me I'm highly paid to protect that data

374
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,940
and somebody says this is what we're

375
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,139
going to do we're going to protect this

376
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,120
data

377
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,120
so I've always got a job you you will

378
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,560
always have a job to do here's the

379
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,339
system to protect

380
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,139
Okay so

381
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,420
First Step so I got a couple

382
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,980
observations I want to share with you

383
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,899
all right first and foremost I want to

384
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,160
tell you that

385
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,399
are product vendors and Fields

386
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,440
cyber security products do not work

387
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,720
see the problem I had there cyber

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,639
security products do not work

389
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,139
you know what

390
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,560
say that how you feel better

391
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,880
honestly because I I started to feel

392
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,980
better as I started to say let's be

393
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,440
honest our cyber security price our

394
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,180
vendors who sells products to protect

395
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,579
our systems these products are not

396
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,560
physical course

397
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,680
they do not match the capabilities the

398
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,579
enthusiasm and intent the resources of

399
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,079
our adversities

400
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,180
okay you know

401
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,339
our product vendor is always a step

402
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,600
behind

403
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,139
the threat and clearly

404
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,660
we should ask an energy is set ahead of

405
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,740
the threat

406
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,100
our products are reactive they are not

407
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,519
proactive they're reactors what to do

408
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,740
after you've had a breach

409
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,260
what do you do after the guy The

410
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,440
Intruders in the house

411
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,500
now honestly I'm not here to

412
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,680
rag off any product vendor but I will

413
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,620
show you I will talk about freely but

414
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,180
tell yourselves the next time you look

415
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,880
at a product vendor you have to add you

416
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,420
have to I usually here's my point

417
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,279
a product vendor Hazel as you know you

418
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
know they're going to do research they

419
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,519
come up with their product and then they

420
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,660
take it to Market and that's that's

421
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,040
going to stay on the market until they

422
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,019
make a return on investment

423
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,360
okay I get it you know this this is the

424
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
way that any Market works okay but our

425
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,579
our industry the cyber security industry

426
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,040
their job the job of our vendors should

427
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,620
be to protect systems okay and my point

428
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,139
to you is saying that they're reactive

429
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,320
instead of being proactive you and I

430
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,600
it's like we they sell us knives to take

431
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,399
the gun fights

432
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,399
doesn't get any clearer than that for me

433
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,000
right

434
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,079
wrong

435
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,940
am I wrong

436
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,339
because as soon as we have a problem our

437
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,259
vendors go to their Laboratories figure

438
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,779
out something to do about it

439
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,660
8 9 10 months later we got a product for

440
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,360
that but our third actors have moved up

441
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,640
because and they're just they're always

442
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,480
always always

443
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,400
we are consistent I am I have spent 30

444
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,380
years in this profession and by the time

445
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,119
of technology and defense technology

446
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,059
comes out it's OD but it stays on the

447
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,160
market and you've seen a struggle with

448
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,740
this intrusion detection intrusion

449
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,740
prevention sand lighting there's always

450
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,780
a new thing

451
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,000
because they're reacting towards live

452
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
actors and not anticipating important

453
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,900
where it should be the opposite word

454
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,960
traffickers should be you know reactive

455
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,660
and these and our vendors should be

456
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,679
setting the pace at the beginning

457
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,880
I don't know

458
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
yeah

459
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,360
[Music]

460
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,179
extremely well funded

461
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,700
what's the unknown okay I don't want to

462
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,960
talk about that and I

463
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,940
I didn't because the unknown is their

464
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,460
business okay you're saying security is

465
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,280
the unknown and I I think I've spent 30

466
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,440
years in my profession where my vendors

467
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,660
have let me down and you and I not to

468
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,100
jump ahead that you and I are seeing

469
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,140
vendor products now

470
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,120
are attackers

471
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,100
so I don't you know I don't believe in

472
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,440
the unknown I don't believe that it's a

473
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,299
vendor can manufacture anything that

474
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,820
would have a problem with it it'd be

475
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,440
like a car that says geez I didn't know

476
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,900
that those explosives were in the trauma

477
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,660
and they built that car for you

478
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,000
yeah I get your point you know but

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,100
cybers technology moves everything's

480
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,380
moves everything's Dynamic the threats

481
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,780
we go to sleep you know we go through

482
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,280
our day we see correct vulnerabilities

483
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,840
in it and go to sleep and wake up the

484
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,460
next day new threats new vulnerabilities

485
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,559
new technology get it it's a moving

486
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,520
Target

487
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,480
my point to use in general as a strategy

488
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,360
as a strategy our vendors should have a

489
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
more proactive stance and keep us out of

490
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,460
Harm's Way that they don't we're no

491
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,080
longer protect and serve we're ducking

492
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,260
cover

493
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,660
that's just my opinion

494
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,340
what I've been doing this for 30 years

495
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,320
and I don't see a technology I no longer

496
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,480
keep up with technology I give up what's

497
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
the point

498
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,140
defensive technology cyber security

499
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,940
products here's the new shiny thing

500
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,860
that's going to protect your

501
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,220
I've stood behind too many

502
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,039
Okay negative yeah absolutely my point

503
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,980
is we're they're giving us products at

504
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,919
architectural award that we fight

505
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,620
and I I just keep that in mind

506
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,020
any mayor may not agree with it you may

507
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,240
think about it comes but then they bring

508
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,940
a bazooka to the to the yeah and that's

509
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,559
the war you're going to next

510
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
yeah because that's it it's kind of

511
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,860
constant honest escalation

512
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,840
but you are you will have the less

513
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,539
effective on you buying that in November

514
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,720
to turn to a attack

515
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,020
the front actor who's

516
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,440
is

517
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,539
my observation that's my experience

518
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,220
uh okay so we got these we got these

519
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,799
products these vendors and you ever sees

520
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,160
products and they hype them up okay

521
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,039
I hope so Alex in every industry I get

522
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,340
it but honestly honestly look at the

523
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,600
hype and tell me hey what it means uh

524
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,460
Market leading the gav and integrated

525
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,780
threat intelligence and immediate

526
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,419
response yeah all right what's in the

527
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,679
Gap again

528
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,740
I know next Generation antivirus I had

529
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,480
to look that up

530
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
the point you know you know first Cloud

531
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,140
native endpoint protection platform and

532
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,200
that secures my business how

533
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,380
uh love this one autonomous AI endpoint

534
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,960
protection it's smart it plays by its

535
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,660
own rules is that a good idea

536
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,620
would you say like oh

537
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,640
yeah

538
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,380
absolutely absolutely that's what you

539
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,419
know that's it's like if you don't have

540
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,299
anything to sell you them you

541
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,640
know you tell them a lot you tell them

542
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
fancy stuff that they go that sounds

543
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
like I need you know I need to detect

544
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,760
and protect against known and unknown

545
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,740
vulnerabilities with cross-generational

546
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,780
protection techniques there please

547
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,220
anybody here explain to me what

548
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,919
cross-generational what does that mean

549
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,380
to me in my mind it's a grandfather and

550
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,120
a child who come together and say all

551
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,860
right listen I had this in the 70s and I

552
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,780
had this in 2020. let's put them

553
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,600
together I don't get that but we buy

554
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
that okay

555
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,799
and we buy that with these images good

556
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,039
can't even see that of of Hoodie hackers

557
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,740
you know come on please show me a Blog

558
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,260

559
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,880
website show me a conference website

560
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,460
that doesn't have some some art you know

561
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,780
evil hoodie sitting in a in a in Shadows

562
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,500
hacking and your and my emotional

563
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,679
reaction is fear

564
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,760
because that's how these products are

565
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,860
sold to us through us

566
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,620
view station and fear

567
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,380
be afraid be very afraid

568
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,820
right

569
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,880
it's fun if you're drinking now you're

570
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,100
always going to be you'll be hacked you

571
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,100
it's not a question of when if it's a

572
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,600
question of when how many times have you

573
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,460
heard that I spent 30 years in a

574
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,559
profession and I I wake up with paranoid

575
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,240
dreams

576
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,600
we breathe paranoid we breed it we live

577
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,919
and breathe it

578
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,140
it's either all the images in our

579
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,720
industry and maybe that's appropriate

580
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,980
maybe not

581
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,440
I've actually seen arrested Russian

582
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,419
organized crime members they don't wear

583
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,900
hoodies they wear a three-piece suits

584
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,640
they've got more money than this whole

585
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,400
room combined they don't walk around in

586
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,480
tracksuits and hoodies

587
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,980
but it's fear it's fear and fear is what

588
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,200
you know when you fear is a wartime

589
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,020
propaganda strategy be very be afraid be

590
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,020
very free it's US versus them

591
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,120
buy the products from us to protect

592
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
yourself from them

593
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,679
it's a proven strategy

594
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,260
get us here okay give him a little

595
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,640
something to say here's what you need

596
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
then here's what you need to protect

597
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
yourself

598
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,760
and that's what we do in our districts

599
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
it is

600
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,419
behind the city the next website the

601
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,120
blog or else we look at and tell me if

602
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,340
there's not images that you're in there

603
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,500
tell them especially for associated with

604
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,240
something you need to buy

605
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,919
it's not beautiful

606
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,100
calm down

607
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,780
and I got a problem with that

608
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,700
and I got a problem with this something

609
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,460
we don't say out loud

610
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,799
I'm here to universities vendor's profit

611
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,500
from the insecurity of computing

612
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,059
[Music]

613
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,520
tell me another thing about computer

614
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
security vendors profits from the

615
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,460
insecurity of computing

616
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,620
it's a lot like the pharmaceutical

617
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,539
industry profits from treating symptoms

618
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,720
it holds includes viruses diseases the

619
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,380
rashes find this jail by that pill okay

620
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,600
the computer security industry profits

621
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,559
from the insecurity of computing

622
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,059
so maybe

623
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,940
maybe just maybe it's in their best

624
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,860
interest that we never have a secure

625
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,539
system

626
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,360
a secure solution I'm saying if there

627
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,880
was a silver bullet we wouldn't find it

628
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,440
in our industry because our industry

629
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,360
makes money

630
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,100
by the insecure

631
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,919
of our systems

632
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,780
that's not paranoia this is the fact

633
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,480
it's just an economic fact or I would

634
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,059
suggest to you is maybe it's not in a

635
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,100
vendor's commercial commercials best

636
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,840
interest

637
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,220
to secure our systems

638
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,799
because I I don't think you see that

639
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,059
about

640
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,460
and I'm not it's just natural it's just

641
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,279
a market fact

642
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,900
that I think you should acknowledge

643
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,920
anybody disagree

644
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,999
[Music]

645
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
okay

646
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,700
they also have absolutely no

647
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,279
accountability

648
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,679
so he'll become better to solve this a

649
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,580
product

650
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,159
right now does it work

651
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,679
to your chair no not that you care are

652
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,539
they accountable for it let's talk about

653
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,860
accountability

654
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,440
you buy a firewall and it doesn't

655
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,940
prevent traffic from coming into the

656
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,620
port that it's supposed to

657
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,639
did you like that

658
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,640
you buy anti-anti malware and you get a

659
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,940
virus

660
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,279
the product doesn't work ask yourself

661
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,320
well it doesn't work

662
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,900
what is it about our industry where if

663
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,580
the product doesn't work

664
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,200
and I will give you the very strong

665
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,080
example all right sometime that's the

666
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,900
word is what it's not weird and that's

667
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,480
where is malware

668
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,039
I don't know if a business isn't running

669
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,840
three to five different types of

670
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,600
anti-malware Solutions and then they get

671
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,919
ransomware

672
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,960
why isn't the first call to the vendor

673
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,820
and say I bought your anti-malware

674
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,580
solution I got ransomware

675
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,580
I want my money back and I want the

676
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,179
impact of your negligent product on my

677
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,679
system

678
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,539
if you aren't looking at ransomware

679
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,880
today and saying that's an antivirus

680
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,120
ain't fit for purpose problem then you

681
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,679
don't get it

682
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
but think of it our second

683
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,039
all these guys get it and but you know

684
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,659
what they'll say here pick me up 3D

685
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:16,799
product

686
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,100
that's all that's our update

687
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
but ask yourself in one other industry

688
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,539
you buy a flat screen TV you take it

689
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,940
home it doesn't work you take it back

690
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,760
all right I'm saying you buy a firewalls

691
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,980
you put it in there and traffic gets

692
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,840
through it doesn't get taken no no no no

693
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,000
no not in our industry you know

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,580
you know zero accountability by our

695
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,100
vendors if the products don't work if

696
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,419
your products are associated with

697
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,520
breeches

698
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,700
and financial impact

699
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,620
I don't know of another industry where

700
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,860
that isn't the rule whereas consumers we

701
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,020
wouldn't be upset for that

702
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,480
no accountability all right let's talk

703
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,580
about leadership these are guys we buy

704
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,860
those products from right

705
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,500
from the rsas from the various signs of

706
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,380
physical pardon meal all these this is

707
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,779
the guys we buy the products from

708
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:10,799
yeah

709
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,640
um

710
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,140
every single one of these guys have been

711
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,720
hacked in the last 18 months

712
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,960
every single one of our major security

713
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,299
vendors have been hacked within the last

714
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,760
year and a half

715
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,700
these are the guys we go to

716
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,340
for the solutions to protect our systems

717
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,980
aren't they using their own products

718
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,779
you know ask yourself what's going on

719
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,880
here these are security vendors who

720
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,919
cannot protect their own systems who you

721
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,440
and I go to say can I have this can I

722
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,659
buy that from you

723
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,580
they're not magicians they don't know

724
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,740
anything that we don't know they're not

725
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,720
leaders

726
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,000
they're not Shepherds

727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
they're cheap they're just as lost as

728
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
you and I

729
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
they can't protect their own systems RSA

730
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,360
loses its code oh sorry about that we're

731
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,100
going to revitalize the Bing Bang Boom

732
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,320
here's another one anytime and no

733
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,799
accountability

734
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,080
and you should you see it LastPass

735
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,700
everything everything that's in the news

736
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,919
these are security vendors were getting

737
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,659
reached

738
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,440
isn't it

739
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,940
doesn't that seem a little this piece of

740
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,740
the leaders

741
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,720
sonic wall and I do want to spend some

742
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,220
time on this because this is a typical

743
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,440
example sonic wall was actually this is

744
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,419
about a year ago in February I just love

745
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,279
this this is their actual press release

746
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,620
all right as reported our security alert

747
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,020
on January 22nd SonicWALL identified a

748
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,640
sophisticated coordinated Cyber attack

749
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,980
by our systems and a probable probable

750
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,140
not certain probable zero day

751
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,240
vulnerabilities okay in certain products

752
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,179
this is their whole VPN and remote

753
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,919
connectivity line that they launched

754
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,140
during the pandemic all right with the

755
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,419
half of top read threat top threat

756
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,340
researchers meaning they had to bring in

757
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,740
the third party and come with the

758
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,740
problem was all right uh all right we

759
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,620
we've got a patch we've got it yeah and

760
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,480
oh everything's good

761
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,340
everything's good

762
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
they have ransomware

763
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,380
the the uh The Ransom was five million

764
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,880
U.S

765
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,679
okay first of all

766
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,899
so zero day vulnerability nah that's

767
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,580
then it's not the fault and they got a

768
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,740
patch all good all good right

769
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,059
what's the zero be vulnerability

770
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,279
it's an unknown unknown right it's it's

771
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,679
a vulnerability in the code that nobody

772
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,659
saw and again this is what I brought up

773
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,480
earlier how can a manufacturer of

774
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,520
anything not know what's in your product

775
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,799
how could they not how did they not know

776
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,899
they had a zero I don't read one of

777
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,039
those you're going to build something

778
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,140
for me better I ask you to build a house

779
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,600
better not have a zero day vulnerability

780
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,220
some kind of hidden vulnerability I

781
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,740
didn't see in the house falls down

782
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,960
a back door to their product they

783
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,240
manufactured it tell me how that it

784
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,039
takes them off the book

785
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,740
because they didn't apply secure by

786
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,779
Design the code they wrote wasn't

787
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,659
subjects in each devops Etc not like any

788
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,260
other vendor

789
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,520
because that's what she do

790
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,440
these are our viewers

791
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,720
we go to them for the solutions and this

792
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,580
is my point of view so these are not

793
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,159
leaders

794
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,320
shortness just just have the last one

795
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,279
same exact same thing a year later

796
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,919
fortinety you know sonic wall these guys

797
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,919
are our industry

798
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,200
and maybe not your industry but my

799
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,240
clients buy these products in the droves

800
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,640
make these companies millions and

801
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,100
millions every year and they're not even

802
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,779
practicing

803
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,779
foreign

804
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,840
ERS off the book because they don't even

805
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,820
practice secure by Design

806
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,939
shame on this shame on them

807
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,260
here's another really good example we

808
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,260
talked about ransomware these are 43 uh

809
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,480
common vulnerabilities and exposures 43

810
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,440
this is by search these 43 cdes are

811
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,779
responsible for over 90 of the

812
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,399
ransomware attacks in the last five

813
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,639
years

814
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,779
vendors are like all of those vendor

815
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,059
vulnerabilities in general are one of

816
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,679
the largest problems in terms of

817
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,620
vulnerabilities

818
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,600
these vulnerabilities sitting right out

819
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,700
in plain sight told parallel CC are

820
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,799
responsible for over 90 percent of the

821
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,899
ransomware attack slow movement

822
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,659
how do we stand for that

823
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,700
how do we stand for that how come

824
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,740
they're not part of their discussion on

825
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,200
ransomware I don't know how much you

826
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,520
guys talked about writing somewhere but

827
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,020
that's all the market thoughts about

828
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,520
their herds on fire

829
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,380
yeah well somebody picked up the phone

830
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,360
call for it and say say take care of

831
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,299
your your three cdes and one on our way

832
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,559
to fixing this problem

833
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
all right now I'm just getting shorty

834
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,140
[Music]

835
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,940
here's another thing I ask you to watch

836
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,100
out for this uh came out in Wired

837
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,899
Magazine a year ago do you know one out

838
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,679
of three vpns or Chinese owned

839
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,019
and he did that it went from three

840
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:37,140
percent to 30 inside of two years we're

841
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,140
in Hawaii they're a good tick tock

842
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,539
China is rapidly buying up security

843
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,779
vendors rapidly things that we're

844
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,580
supposed to trust are vpns encrypted

845
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,740
vpns

846
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,080
immigration what's going on here

847
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
well you know do you do you know who

848
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,600
owns your vendor

849
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,260
should you

850
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,260
all right

851
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,200
um I'll pick up the pace a little

852
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,780
yeah because I I need to manage security

853
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,080
service providers same idea right well

854
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,580
managed security service provider

855
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,760
provides us a process but a package

856
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,080
process process process all right uh for

857
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,760
this example let's let's talk about

858
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,960
monitoring all right uh um sins and and

859
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,139
and stock products to monitor for for

860
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,719
our breaches all right and you pay a

861
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,399
managed service provider he brings this

862
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,399
process to this table but puts a box in

863
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,918
your you know in your uh rack you know

864
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,599
but essentially it's the same idea what

865
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,460
they're taking is their process in

866
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,800
applying their process based on the

867
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,839
capabilities and the limitations of

868
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,599
their product to your environment

869
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,899
all right so I kind of constantly find

870
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,520
these to my clients wait a minute Square

871
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,220
pay round hole they're taking what they

872
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,380
know to be the pro problem and bringing

873
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,420
into your environment say yeah it's like

874
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,400
so a man with a hammer everything looks

875
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,660
like a

876
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,660
subscribe

877
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,579
and that's it so for me that's exactly

878
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,680
over time

879
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,240
with the security problem with the

880
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,000
security product your problem looks like

881
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,640
a nail oh what is that just hammered

882
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,759
hard

883
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,040
okay but um so but what we've got here

884
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,180
is a is a is is a is a vendor sayings

885
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,800
taking something that they've managed

886
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,680
that's easy for them to deploy and

887
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,099
monitor but hard for us to actually

888
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,020
manage and for me the this brings

889
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,940
through when we talk about you know none

890
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,380
of this stuff called your software as a

891
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,280
service

892
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
from Salesforce to you know all these

893
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,500
things and any single business out there

894
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,420
has all of their information assets and

895
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,920
software as a service

896
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,900
Advanced service providers don't do that

897
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,359
any cloud provider it's you know unless

898
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,859
you get it from the cloud provider

899
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,960
themselves

900
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,839
so you're it's like you need to take

901
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,820
their answer and then stretch it onto

902
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,980
your environment to protect your assets

903
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,619
now the real problem is that in terms of

904
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,960
in terms of resources what you need to

905
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,599
these products if they do work on your

906
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,280
environment are all about the

907
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,260
configuration right you guys know that

908
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,240
it's all about they require a lot of

909
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,280
fine-tuning Maintenance and watering and

910
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,619
sunlight and then the patching and

911
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,960
updating you know it's it's a it's the

912
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,119
process driven and right rightfully so

913
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,300
but they're heavily reliant on your

914
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,460
ability to keep them currents

915
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,740
all right retriguing you know put

916
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,720
another patch in read yeah but at the

917
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,400
end of the day you know the service

918
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,859
level agreements don't clarify we plug

919
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,140
them in and then go to our dashboards

920
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,820
and wait for the alerts that's what we

921
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,220
do and we think that the alerts we are

922
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,320
seeing because of the configuration of

923
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,359
the pro of the device are showing us all

924
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,880
the activity they get paid to tell us

925
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,619
that the tree falls in the forest it

926
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,140
makes a sound to us here or there so if

927
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,700
it doesn't make a sound to them it

928
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,099
doesn't make the sound to us

929
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,320
well the assumption is they don't always

930
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,260
see all they're all okay anyway but

931
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,660
that shows you in terms of in terms of

932
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,640
the onus of this at the end of the day

933
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,740
they're gonna they're gonna come and

934
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,380
configure it and turn it over to you in

935
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,480
your system you'll add this subtract

936
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,880
this year and Sunday within within six

937
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
months you're out of tune

938
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
you're out and what they did find they

939
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,480
no longer fine

940
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,760
that's probably what I want for me the

941
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
more the more important problem is the

942
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,780
difficult same products that you see out

943
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,619
there

944
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:47,960
typical

945
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,339
yeah say this well that's fine

946
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,339
it's impulse is it positive

947
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,020
what does that mean false positive yes

948
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,300
no you need a binary answer these are

949
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,820
the breaches and Outreach you can

950
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,500
and so what you have to do is you got to

951
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,720
get up and go investigate so the onus is

952
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,160
on you but the industry recognizes a 40

953
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,540
false positive for managed service

954
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,079
providers

955
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,240
40 of the time that what they're looking

956
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,579
at they're not sure so you better go

957
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,040
check it out

958
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,339
40 of the time now this is me I'm just

959
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,800
saying if your product is wrong four out

960
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,560
of ten times maybe just maybe you're not

961
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,180
ready for the market

962
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,420
okay well I don't get it we buy products

963
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,800
that are wrong forty percent of the time

964
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,140
fact

965
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,359
and so what happens what happens is we

966
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,140
stop

967
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,480
we just stop you know a stock analyst

968
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,579
sits there a third of the time the cube

969
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,859
fills up he's just stops

970
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,320
so even what we hear in 40 percent may

971
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,880
or may not beat your wheel down oh

972
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,640
please stop them it's alert fatigue

973
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,500
these things are just our smoke

974
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,400
detectives that constantly

975
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,359
and after a while you just take a

976
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,000
battery out won't you

977
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
do

978
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
you have to be burning down when you

979
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,619
bought that smoke detector to protected

980
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,500
family in your house you know the

981
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,540
manufacturers that came and installed it

982
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,259
and configured it

983
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,079
so I need to tell I need a part of the

984
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,180
party

985
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,420
but this is the problem in my issue

986
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,920
neglect right why because the products

987
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,020
are not reliable

988
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,800
and so and but honestly the whole the

989
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,560
whole concept is in this we accept the

990
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,900
term false positive

991
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,480
can you imagine if you if you your

992
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,980
mother called you and said why'd you do

993
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,359
that it's a false popularity

994
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,200
for false positive the answers in the

995
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
question

996
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,859
all right so what happens is that we

997
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,020
neglect the technology because the Net

998
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,780
Technology requires too much resource

999
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,119
it's too much tweaking too many false

1000
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,339
positives and then what we do is next

1001
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,440
year we buy the new sexiest thing we go

1002
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,700
around the board again

1003
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,980
I don't know the company you know a

1004
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,900
because the person who was trained on

1005
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,359
that sin he's left he left two years ago

1006
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,520
nobody knows how to do it you just keeps

1007
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
telling so we just didn't disconnect the

1008
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,940
battery hey let's go buy something new

1009
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,040
and that's what we do we're caught in

1010
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,800
this circle with absolutely no

1011
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
accountability

1012
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,320
you got a Sim it's a false positive or

1013
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,700
it's actually a positive you had a

1014
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,000
breach is the vendor reliable

1015
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,619
it's not

1016
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,440
so tell me if you had a burglar alarm in

1017
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,359
your house and it didn't cover all the

1018
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,980
parts of your house but the parts it did

1019
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,760
Cover you had a intruder he came in and

1020
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,780
he got out

1021
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,540
when you what this is why this guy is

1022
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,280
something you are that alarm company

1023
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,200
doesn't bear a little responsibility for

1024
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,480
that because you bought that product for

1025
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,099
that purpose and it failed you

1026
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,800
no accountability okay these are the top

1027
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,859
msses you know where this is going every

1028
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,339
single one of the top uh 10 mssps have

1029
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,320
been reached in the last year and a half

1030
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,599
same same rule 18 months of this

1031
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,700
presentation all these guys

1032
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,400
okay okay using the products to monitor

1033
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,980
their own systems and if they are how

1034
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,260
are they working with that 40 uh uh

1035
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,700
false positive problem

1036
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,940
no leadership these guys you know they

1037
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,560
talk to talk and they don't walk the

1038
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,180
walk

1039
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,640
there's no secrets that they know that

1040
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,660
that we have to learn to buy them they

1041
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,280
do not they cannot protect their health

1042
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,820
systems

1043
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,440
okay in that service providers this is a

1044
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,640
little different but sorry it just

1045
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,280
involved me here the internet is so

1046
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,099
beautiful it's an old guy like me the

1047
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,720
internet's just a beautiful thing but

1048
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,400
I've watched you know cyber crime the

1049
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,960
team that we all go to the internet then

1050
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,119
I just don't understand that cyber

1051
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,700
Security Professionals why we don't talk

1052
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,980
about internet service providers as part

1053
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,780
of the problem

1054
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,160
right

1055
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,200
you know for me is like some crazy

1056
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,359
nightclub all right you're saying a line

1057
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,619
you hear a little thing and getting the

1058
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,180
knife up and it's wild and it's great we

1059
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,760
do all these kind of things

1060
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,740
and we could buy in the internet the

1061
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,660
person who lets us in at my boat is our

1062
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,020
ISP it's VT it's Verizon it's whoever

1063
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,599
you buy your your ISP service phones

1064
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,099
these are like the dorm into that

1065
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,960
nightclub

1066
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,760
and once you get inside then I got

1067
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,400
anything goes there's no right there's

1068
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,040
no wrong there's no cars security guards

1069
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,140
and they're saying put out that fire uh

1070
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,880
don't just put that wallet back your

1071
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,400
ceiling there's absolutely no oversight

1072
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
on the internet

1073
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,339
how do you do that that's it but there's

1074
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,740
no one on the internet who's looking at

1075
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,800
cyber crime and says stop that stop that

1076
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,140
an Iowa service attack stop that Ransom

1077
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,460
stuff you're sending them out there

1078
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,200
other people in this nightclub

1079
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,540
and the nightclub owners the is the

1080
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,400
internet service providers let those pay

1081
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,260
those people commentary so I'm

1082
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,040
suggesting that Navy just maybe

1083
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,859
we're letting these guys off the hook

1084
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:28,140
think of how what a different

1085
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,660
environment the threat land changes look

1086
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,339
like people isps and internet service

1087
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,200
providers did a little bit about let's

1088
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,180
call it house cleansing not talking

1089
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,940
about regulations I'm talking about hey

1090
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,619
you know if you're connecting to the

1091
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,839
internet and you're not patched stop

1092
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,560
down the patch

1093
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,940
this is just some stuff that I've heard

1094
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,680
we us talk about I think it's a lot of

1095
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,839
bad sites the site's sending you that

1096
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,060
done on the service they see it they see

1097
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,560
the traffic's going across them but they

1098
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,700
can stop us

1099
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,099
kill the nip interest immediately all

1100
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,599
right they're doing that

1101
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,359
why aren't they doing it a b why aren't

1102
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,640
we demanding it

1103
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,160
you know here that's like a utility it's

1104
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,560
like gas or electric or water

1105
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,540
you turn on the water Tab and sludge

1106
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,119
comes out you'd be demanding cleaner

1107
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,460
water you turn on the electricity and

1108
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,240
blows all your room flat screen TV

1109
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,280
demanding regulated electricity

1110
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,960
but here we have a utility that's giving

1111
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,200
us a Lifeline the internet is a life

1112
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,319
form and we absolutely required them to

1113
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,839
do know what recite no security

1114
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,000
they only need to stop those service tax

1115
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,760
they see those viruses going

1116
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,560
you hear that right

1117
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,900
a little tiny housekeeping the whole

1118
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,359
difference in the world

1119
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,700
they said kept bad people off the

1120
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,839
internet and they know who the better

1121
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,940
people are they can see it what's the

1122
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,240
point is

1123
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,380
why don't we why is this part of our

1124
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,280
discussion the cyber security

1125
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,500
professions that they own some

1126
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,020
responsibility for everybody in this

1127
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,500
nightclub

1128
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
that's why

1129
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,480
it's because they make money from the

1130
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,240
bandwidth that fires up the bot that

1131
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,280
takes the botnets and the denial of

1132
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,440
services and the ransomware attacks to

1133
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,720
our businesses and to our homes our

1134
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,819
front doors

1135
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,640
why would they stop that that's odd to

1136
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,500
me as a consumer it's very odd to me

1137
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,839
because I don't know about you guys but

1138
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,540
I would pay five pounds a month for no

1139
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,240
viruses

1140
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,460
I would pay 10 pounds a month not to get

1141
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,040
a ransomware or than out of service or

1142
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,560
botnet have my own laptop be thrown into

1143
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
the bottom there's a revenue stream that

1144
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,940
you had

1145
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,619
I think

1146
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,960
there's cash involved in that service

1147
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,480
providers if not we should pull them in

1148
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,420
by their their next minimal part of this

1149
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,160
conversation

1150
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,339
the threat landscape is facilitated by

1151
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,319
the internet as service providers you

1152
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,599
and I paid for the privilege on the

1153
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,780
Earth

1154
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,420
okay no accountability again same same

1155
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,520
idea you get rid of this job no

1156
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,980
accountability here's all these isps top

1157
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,720
10 isps every single one of those guys

1158
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,140
can have

1159
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,540
now there's only one rule

1160
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,060
you know is in terms of you know you

1161
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,220
know ice needs to be prosecuted teaching

1162
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,359
other people yeah

1163
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,180
but they don't unless you happen to them

1164
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,040
you'll see something coming into the

1165
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,420
news about BT prosecutors

1166
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,540
all right so same problem here all right

1167
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,460
I'm going to wrap up with this this last

1168
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,040
idea and this is uh there's a lot of

1169
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,240
things wrong with businesses and you

1170
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,040
guys are going to spend a whole career

1171
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,619
going to conferences about what's wrong

1172
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,599
with cyber security businesses but I've

1173
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,760
been doing this in my lifetime I've got

1174
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,079
three things I want to bring up to your

1175
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,540
attention one is we still have not

1176
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,579
calculated the return on security

1177
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,780
investment

1178
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,599
the spandex we get y i open this

1179
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,400
presentation saying we're spending more

1180
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,079
money and we're having more breaches

1181
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,540
don't understand but nobody actually

1182
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,720
pulls out a pencil and does the math

1183
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,180
it figures out if we buy this by a wall

1184
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,520
if we buy this antivirus what's the

1185
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,980
return to the business we have skill as

1186
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,900
cyber Security Professionals I don't

1187
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,819
care what part of the industry in this

1188
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,520
is our biggest problem we can't quantify

1189
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,560
things in terms of cash

1190
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,920
and the spandex will get away return and

1191
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,660
we don't apply that to the products we

1192
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,660
buy you see that's the problem

1193
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,640
and that's why we buy crap

1194
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,520
you'll never buy bad flat screen CD once

1195
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,140
you buy a battery

1196
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,700
because you understand the return on

1197
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,079
that investment you buy a hundred pound

1198
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,359
flat screen TV or you got a 700 pound

1199
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,220
flat screen TV you know the difference

1200
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,319
is quality we don't do that in our

1201
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,380
industry we don't calculate the how much

1202
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,940
cash we spend and what kind of quality

1203
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,579
it brings us okay and and we certainly

1204
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,460
therefore we don't properly assess the

1205
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,460
products and understand I spend X I get

1206
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,220
y all right and hey I don't know what

1207
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,720
you guys are studying but my world

1208
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,700
there's three attack vectors people

1209
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,040
process technology right that's what my

1210
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,480
temp they said don't show them the

1211
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,060
tattoo in this obviously so I signed a

1212
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,060
non-tattoo disclosure agreement

1213
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,980
that actually works

1214
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,859
um but if I could it says we protect

1215
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,619
people process technology three separate

1216
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,119
attack passes

1217
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,460
I do not own a business that takes the

1218
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,400
allocated budget and says 33 of people

1219
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,119
33 the process 33 of Technology that's

1220
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,940
not the way the whole cyber security

1221
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,339
budget goes into technology and when you

1222
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:00,540
do that your your strategies then is all

1223
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,819
technology driven

1224
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,400
right you're protecting devices and not

1225
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,780
information

1226
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,640
because you're not calculating the

1227
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,680
return on investing in your people or

1228
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,960
investing in your process and we're

1229
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,119
buying the vendors who tell us different

1230
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,400
you're afraid by this and you get your

1231
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,780
annual security systems

1232
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,760
you hear security

1233
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,540
um

1234
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,440
[Music]

1235
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,500
if you're securing oxymoron most of them

1236
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,500
foreign

1237
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,380
[Music]

1238
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,940
that's the problem we don't calculate

1239
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,040
business and therefore our strategy is

1240
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,619
led by technology and so if we get on

1241
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,359
this thing that I'm talking about we've

1242
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,160
got products that don't work all right

1243
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,440
we Implement them on our systems we

1244
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,420
neglect our people we negot elect our

1245
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,700
process you know and and because the

1246
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,619
products don't work we get breached and

1247
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,180
what do we do we go out and start it

1248
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,160
again we buy more products

1249
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,900
continue to

1250
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,760
clinical in our process and we're caught

1251
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,380
on this cycle that we're calling them

1252
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,300
that's my view

1253
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,480
that's my view and it's a business View

1254
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
this is what this is what the industry

1255
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,619
looks like to me this cycle of failure

1256
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,079
and finally

1257
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,119
got three this is the last one what I'm

1258
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,500
going to call duty of care and that that

1259
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,240
means you know businesses still haven't

1260
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,520
gotten it they're told protect gdpr

1261
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,920
information or pcis protect credit card

1262
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,960
data they're going to protect this you

1263
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,240
know protecting data is just the right

1264
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,400
thing to do it's like dude it's like

1265
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,140
fire like safety

1266
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,060
this is not ones and zeros we're

1267
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,460
perfecting this is the information about

1268
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,140
people's lives

1269
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,819
I've also his mother and father

1270
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,339
grandmother grandfather a child

1271
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,520
this is data about people's lives how

1272
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,079
did we lose that

1273
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:57,359
in our conversation about cyber security

1274
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,480
if that consistency

1275
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,000
no at the end of the day our job is to

1276
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,280
protect data because that data is about

1277
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,339
somebody somebody's life your life my

1278
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,059
life

1279
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:11,059
my grandkids

1280
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:14,720
your grandmothers

1281
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,520
I'm not sure

1282
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,680
sorry

1283
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,359
it's been late

1284
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,819
all right so we don't have that we don't

1285
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,440
have an emotional connection to the data

1286
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,480
of the city in the systems that we need

1287
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,440
to to protect all right so I think we're

1288
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,480
failing I think our vendors have failed

1289
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,460
I think our managed service providers a

1290
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,400
field I think our our internet service

1291
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,520
providers have failed I think our

1292
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,260
business is a fish

1293
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,619
but most of all I think you feel

1294
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,839
I think I should

1295
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,559
I I I think that we don't our problems

1296
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,780
in our industry is we don't apply our

1297
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,059
standards of quality in our industry

1298
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:00,180
than we do in any any other asset

1299
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,280
of Our Lives I got a plug I won't go out

1300
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,319
to you because he'll send back a

1301
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,700
Coca-Cola because it doesn't have enough

1302
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,020
ice in there

1303
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,859
seriously you know

1304
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:11,819
you don't want to wait on my brother to

1305
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,500
go out to the restaurant this is called

1306
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,000
this is hot it's like the princess and

1307
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,500
the bee you know this has got too much

1308
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,800
eyes not enough ice too much ice

1309
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,180
because one day says I got a ransomware

1310
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,940
I said yeah call your ISP why don't you

1311
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,460
think about applying that same standard

1312
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,339
of quality as a consumer in your life

1313
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,440
to your industry that you guys are going

1314
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,119
to want to spend with hers

1315
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,160
because there's nothing there you're

1316
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,680
part of the problem

1317
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,660
I wish I would have done this a long

1318
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,380
time ago I wish I would help

1319
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,180
reaches I wish I you know your

1320
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,619
assignment sorry we don't change that

1321
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,180
well then you know what I started doing

1322
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,880
10 years ago Amazon done I had to buy

1323
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,640
something okay I would just take the

1324
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,260
terms and conditions I decided then I'd

1325
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,720
additionally but you are responsible

1326
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,680
appropriation but I'm sending a message

1327
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,020
as consumers we don't send a message we

1328
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,140
need seat belts in these cars airbags

1329
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,980
thank you

1330
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,319
I need we need products that work all

1331
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,660
right our problem is we believe we

1332
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,640
believe what we're told we don't demand

1333
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,200
more for our money we don't expect more

1334
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,880
we don't ask for anything we don't have

1335
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,940
anybody accountable for anything we

1336
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,260
don't apply the same standard of

1337
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,760
Excellence as we do in our lives

1338
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,059
if you don't I'm just about the old man

1339
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:42,000
put out on your side to say I wish

1340
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,380
somebody would have told me this when I

1341
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,859
started up

1342
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:51,059
I guess

1343
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,140
he said

1344
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,900
the next time you ask uh so I've got to

1345
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,880
hold this like okay so there's a I did a

1346
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,859
I did a white paper on this you can go

1347
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,240
over here and download a white paper and

1348
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,260
the white paper the second part of the

1349
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,240
white paper is ask this question of the

1350
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,760
vendor ask this question ask them if

1351
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,500
he's responsible for a breach ask and

1352
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,900
he'll say no and you'll say why not my

1353
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,940
point is put people on the line can hear

1354
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,359
the answers

1355
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:24,599
in the game

1356
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,240
we'll take a little risk with you this

1357
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,099
is what I'm saying as a consumer I think

1358
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,900
this is all requirement to move this

1359
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,420
Market away for accountability and these

1360
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,220
things I've been hard on and it starts

1361
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,140
with us until you ask it's not going to

1362
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,000
be solvable tonight you know suddenly

1363
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,880
Microsoft but it's a slow movie but it

1364
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,460
starts as a consumer you know I gave you

1365
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,839
that analogy people flying through the

1366
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,579
dashboard somebody had to say coming up

1367
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,200
was Ralph Nader I don't know if you guys

1368
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,640
follow it Ralph Nader in the United

1369
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,680
States is credited for automobile safety

1370
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,020
you just tireless advocate for safety

1371
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,420
new cars then we need a Ralph Nader in

1372
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,920
our industry we need somebody who's

1373
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,480
going to stand up and say enough is

1374
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,880
enough and it starts with you it starts

1375
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,859
with the next thing you buy

1376
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:07,140
ask him anyway there's a you know

1377
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,119
nothing nothing jump but there's a whole

1378
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,440
questionnaires but it's all about common

1379
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,540
sense do you here's my best friend

1380
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,579
everybody comes and sells me and I get

1381
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,859

1382
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:20,540

1383
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,400

1385
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,119

1386
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,520
will you sign off for that please take

1387
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,020
responsibility if I use your product and

1388
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,500
it doesn't work why won't you do that

1389
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,859
up here uh is there any questions or I

1390
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:40,339
appreciate nobody throwing anything

1391
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:43,920
it's physically violence anyway uh I

1392
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,319
appreciate your time effort

1393
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,420
um I've got uh here's my email address

1394
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,059
so I can never do anything for you

1395
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:53,339
um the the white paper is a lot of what

1396
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:54,540
I've been talking about but much more

1397
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,460
detailed a lot more examples but it does

1398
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,900
end with about five pages of what you

1399
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,819
can do about it which I think we all

1400
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,720
contribute so

1401
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,319
all right then
