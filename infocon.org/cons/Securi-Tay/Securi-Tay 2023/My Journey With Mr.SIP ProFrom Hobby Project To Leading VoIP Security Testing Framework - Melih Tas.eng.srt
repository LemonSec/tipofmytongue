1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,480
good morning everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,960
joining me today today I want to share

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,480
with you the story of Mr Cipro

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,540
voice rip security testing framework

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,460
it's a tool that started as a simple

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,699
review project but has since grown into

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,800
something much bigger

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,140
it's a software application that allows

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,640
you to test and break voice rapid

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,160
applications and networks and it's a

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,159
tool that has taken me on a journey from

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,399
being a Christian hobbyist published

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,860
academic researcher and a speaker at the

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,079
top maker conferences

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,040
and when I started working on Mr Cipro I

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,719
never could have imagined an impact it

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,719
would tell it was just a simple project

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,579
that I worked on in my free time

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,140
exploring the word of voice and IP

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,520
security and looking for new

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,520
vulnerabilities but as I continue to

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,980
work on it I realized that I had

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,600
stumbled upon something truly available

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,280
for my career

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,400
and my academic research confirmed the

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,840
potential of the job

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
and I was able to present my findings at

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,640
top conferences in Anchor community and

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,740
Mr ship is now used by Security

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,380
Professionals researchers around the

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,140
world and I'm proud to say that it has

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,020
contributed to Second also IP networks

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,220
and applications

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,520
and today I'm here to share with you the

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,860
story of Paul Mr Cipro was created and

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,740
how it has evolved over the years and

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,439
the unique features that set it apart

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,659
from other visual IP Secret tools in the

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,439
market and we will also talk about how

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,759
to make voiceover IB networks and

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
applications using Mr Sim

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,159
and I hope that this story will inspire

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,200
you to explore the world of voice rip

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,420
security and push the boundaries of

45
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,000
what's possible and thank you for being

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
here today let's get started

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,119
before we begin uh I want to dodge your

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,560
familiarity with Voiceover IP security

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
and necessive

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't think we have much but how many

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
of you have experienced with voice OIP

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,739
security

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
okay we have some experts this yeah as

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,099
you know also IP security

55
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,280
it's a complex and evolving field and

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,580
again how many of you have heard of or

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,599
used Mississippi before

58
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,420
cool the video

59
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,700
so for those who haven't uh Mississippi

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,260
is a powerful tool for testing and

61
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,480
securing Voiceover IP networks and

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,899
applications

63
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,379
now uh let me introduce myself my name

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,000
Black Edition in Singapore in May this

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
year

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,660
and last month I have published a

111
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,720
research paper called a noble approach

112
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,060
for efficient mitigation against chip

113
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,600
based the art of attacks in mdpi applied

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,699
science journal and currently I'm

115
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,880
working on a research paper called

116
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,900
blockchain based caller ID

117
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,580
Authentication

118
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,560
is a noble solution to prevent caller

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,139
IDs think attacks in Voiceover IP and

120
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,580
Signal props

121
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,960
and another one is called I'm revealing

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,120
the anatomy of anti-entricular IDs

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
preventing attacks in live Financial

124
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
Centers

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
which I hope to present in one of the

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,040
top Tire conferences such as IEEE SMP

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,580
usenix ndss or

128
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,580
ACN TCS and through my research I have

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,460
contributed five Noble oyster rapid

130
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,320
attacks and adrenal voice variety

131
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,580
defense approaches to the academic

132
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,919
literature and I also discovered six

133
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,440
series from Providence companies like

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,060
IBM and Cisco

135
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,120
and I have been enough by technician UK

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,060
experience and knowledge with you all

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,759
and again I hope this presentation will

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,560
be insightful and tougher working

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,300
I would like to mention about synopsis

142
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300

is known as electronic design automation

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,180
company and first founded in 1986 which

145
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,460
means that it's 37 years old

146
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,460
but over the past decade it has made

147
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
numerous cyber security Acquisitions and

148

172
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,300
security testing blacktop software which

173
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,880
offers software composition analysis

174
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,919
physical providing cyber security

175
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,220
Consulting Services which I'm part of

176
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,919
economical known for its expertising

177
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,319
protocol phasing and credited with

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,080
discovering the heartbeat vulnerability

179
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,560
and lastly quality which specializes in

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
static application security testing

181
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,840
so the board of Mr sip originally I

182
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,660
developed it as a hobby project to Aid

183
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,419
my academic studies focusing on the

184
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,699
development of novelty-based videos

185
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,699
attacks and the project is proved to be

186
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,979
a success and resulting in several

187
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:44,940
academic

188
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
research papers and journal articles

189
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,340
and as the project evolves uh we still

190
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,099
became a functional recipient test tool

191
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,740
uh that offers some unique features and

192
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,180
capabilities not found in other

193
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,680
Voiceover IP security tools on the

194
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,960
market and I made it open source and

195
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
started to present it at Accurate

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,259
conferences

197
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,419
and it has been well received by the

198
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,880
cyber security and Telecom community and

199
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,400
has been used by some individuals and

200
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,020
organizations from cyber security

201
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,240
researchers to network admits and

202
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,520
penetration testers and even has been

203
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,280
used by major companies like Cisco

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,919
and people also use Mississippi as a zip

205
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,539
client simulator and ship traffic

206
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,800
generator

207
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,500
and with the success of Mr ship I

208
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,180
decided to keep announcing the features

209
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,700
and capabilities and named it as Mr

210
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,080
Cipro

211
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,059
which is also rapid security testing

212
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,478
framework

213
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,360
and this is the timeline

214
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,039
so it was a project of mine that ranked

215
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,420
first in an Innovative Innovation

216
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,640
competition that I participated in 2010

217
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,940
while I was working at Natasha and we

218
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,160
raised about 2 million euros in research

219
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,880
funds at the time and that that project

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
led the establishment of the cyber

221
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
security department from one engineer to

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
100 Engineers within three years and

223
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,140
within that three years we also had

224
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,700
other

225
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,519
some other cyber security projects and

226
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
in total we were founded around 10

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,660
million euros at the time and first

228
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,580
prototypes were founded and used by

229
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,080
Turkish government

230
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,260
and between 2011 and 2015 a Mississippi

231
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,019
remained as closed source and in 2015 I

232
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,940
left the company

233
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,620
and the company decided to stop the

234
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,600
project in a few years later

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,899
in 2016 I decided to reprogram all the

236
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,580
tools utilizing all of my past

237
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,160
experiences and I probably published the

238
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
first open source version in 2017 and we

239
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,320
presented the project at blackhead USA

240
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,440
EU and Asia arsenals a Defcon main stage

241
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
and also from Moscow

242
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,680
[Music]

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,660
it's also appeared in academic papers

244
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,779
promotional IEEE as they were an ndpi

245
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,440
journals and in 2021 we participated

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,779
some competitions and were ranked first

247
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,899
in custom prices

248
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,839
now with you at secretary and we will be

249
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,600
at blanket Asia in Singapore in May this

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,779
year

251
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,399
so some facts about voice of Rapid

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,220
security it's a critical issue that

253
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,019
needs to be addressed for several

254
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,040
reasons

255
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,399
according to cfc's latest report the

256
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,360
total loss of teleconference was around

257
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,459
28.2 billion dollars which corresponds

258
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,260
to

259
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,240
1.74 percent of the total Telecom

260
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,220
revenues and this highlights the

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,800
importance of ensuring that Voiceover IP

262
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,660
systems are secure

263
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,220
and when we look at the most common

264
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,640
weaknesses we can see that Voiceover IP

265
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,140
users and PB systems are the most

266
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,480
targeted and in the graphic from

267
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
psychologics latest annual voice

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,980
security report we can see that the

269
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,600
biggest risk for communication systems

270
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
are telephony denial service attacks and

271
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,300
color ideas missing crowds

272
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,620
yeah

273
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,220
and there are several reasons why why

274
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,839
should I be Technologies are near the

275
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,320
weak the first the oil surviv Protocols

276
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
are not designed securely and vendors

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,519
you cannot meet today's security needs

278
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,040
additionally

279
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,200
Voiceover IP is not managed equally in

280
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
companies generally as voice would I be

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
continues to become more prevalent it

282
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,980
will become an indispensable need in the

283
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,339
near future

284
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,240
there is a need for a product that can

285
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
detect and Report security problems

286
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,320
specific to Voiceover IP and Mississippi

287
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,959
has been designed to fill this needs and

288
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,360
it's available to for anyone who wants

289
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,519
to ensure the security of their voice

290
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,380
over IP and unified communication

291
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,480
systems

292
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,380
in their Network

293
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,620
before we go in to more technicalities

294
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,600
let's understand how supports basically

295
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,120
there are three common approaches of

296
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,440
deploying voice to IP within

297
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
organizations

298
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,940
internal Authority implementation

299
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,620
manager services and online sip ranking

300
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,260
or a session initiation protocol is a

301
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,540
text-based protocol for establishing and

302
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,700
managing communication sessions between

303
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,540
two or more devices or IP networks and

304
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,000
CP users request methods and response

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,940
types very similar to http some common

306
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,899
request types include invite like buy or

307
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,980
cancel

308
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,500
and there will be some others and

309
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,320
response types includes

310
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,000
1863636 which means a very similar to

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,360
http

312
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,740
and the basic overflow for ship involves

313
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,820
two users and a server in the middle the

314
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,860
first user sends an invite request to

315
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,139
the server which forwards it to the

316
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,360
second user and the second user responds

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
with a message the response message and

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,700
if the call is accepted two users can

319
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,040
begin communicating using RTP which is

320
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,079
the real-time transport protocol which

321
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,739
is the media

322
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
as I said while sleep is similar to http

323
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
it's more complex and has its own unique

324
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,920
features such as specific headers and

325
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,680
parameters that I wanted to speak one

326
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,860
specific and unique for each call like

327
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,000
call ID header

328
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,279
and it uses a mechanism similar to http

329
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,500
digest for user authentication it's

330
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,360
called as a zip ties authentication

331
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,060
where the user passport is pressured as

332
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,139
symmetrical and in version 2 the nd5

333
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,240
hashing algorithm is applied to the

334
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,339
authentication Data before it's time to

335
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,540
the server

336
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,639
and the simple interesting message is

337
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,100
used for user registration and contains

338
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,320
some useful information for executing an

339
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,980
authentication attack

340
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,440
Mr Cipro is a fully featured version of

341
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,720

public modules are also extended with

351
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,019
new features

352
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,120
and the red ones are still under

353
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,160
development or test space

354
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,060
overall Mr Cipro can discover voice of

355
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,800
Ip devices on the network report

356
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
vulnerabilities and simulate over 100

357
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,720
different attacks enable scenarios

358
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,180
specific to Voiceover IP

359
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,940

graphical user interface

365
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,680
so one of the most notable

366
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,740
is the automated test flow process which

367
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,600
improves efficiency and accuracy in

368
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,120

allows for a smoother testing process

370
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,079
and makes it easier to identify

371
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,120
potential vulnerabilities

372
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,940
another unique feature is a

373
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,820
its ability to simulate real Network

374
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,579

to create a basic virtual Voiceover IP

474
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,140
security laboratory we can follow these

475
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,320
steps first set up virtual machines for

476
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
the ippv systems such as tricks packs or

477
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,620
free PBS and there are many more and the

478
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,780
attacker machine

479
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,960
such as Kali Linus in stolen

480
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,480
configuration service on the ippb

481
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,620
systems

482
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,559
register users on the synchronous

483
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,220
install soft clients such as Viper Gypsy

484
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,740
and Lead form on the virtual machine

485
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,900
and install Mr Cipro on the attacker

486
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,620
mission

487
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,460
and configure Mr Cipro to the Target the

488
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,400
IPP systems and users and platform with

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,380
the web security testing using Mr

490

491
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,940
just set up allows for safe and

492
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,380
controlled testing of Voiceover IP

493
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,299
security vulnerabilities without risking

494
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,640
the damage to a live production

495
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,120
environment

496
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,460
and in the rest of the slides I will

497
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,080
discuss the major modules of Mississippi

498
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,140
cross and their relation to various

499
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,160
voice Library penetration testing tasks

500
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,860
the first one is the thickness it's a

501
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
network scanner and used to identify

502
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,640
service and versions

503
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,620
the gas Network and collects details

504
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,140
about zip clients and servers present on

505
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,340
the network

506
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,039
including IP address hostname random

507
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,860

number

509
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,280
and it accepts inputs such as IP address

510
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,220
IP address range or IP subnet

511
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,080
and it gives us data by sending various

512
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,780
sweet messages to the IP addresses and

513
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,820
makes computations based on the response

514
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,418
received

515
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,760
another information engaging module is

516
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,600
cpnom which is denominator how to

517
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,360
identify active extensions and data

518
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,640
authentication statuses on the target

519
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,700
Network and it stands cheap register or

520
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,919
subscribe messages to the Target server

521
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,400
numerates ETS based on the responses

522
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,919
and to initiate the animation process

523
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,620
cpnam requires the default the username

524
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,760
and extension dictionary

525
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,299
another information engagement module is

526
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,520
cheap sniff which is a network signifier

527
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,559
it performs a targeted middle attack

528
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,080
against Network and it sniffs the

529
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
network and filters or with rip traffic

530
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
okay and along with many of the middle

531
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,820
module six sniff provides capabilities

532
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,620
and information flow for many other

533
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,700
modules

534
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,640
and even fundamental middle capability

535
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,280
is deactivated it can still be used to

536
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,380
filter the voice of Ip traffic across

537
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,799
the server

538
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,760
another information network module is

539
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,799
steep Evas which is a Voiceover IP

540
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,900
called Eros proper

541
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,820
it filters and intercepts both right

542
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,220
because in the Target Network by

543
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,620
utilizing in the middle and significant

544
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,440
capabilities it captures and collects

545
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,539
all specific data at a signaling level

546
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,120
the direction of the call and the unique

547
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
call ID value and it fits this data into

548
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,580
other modules as well as automated

549
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,020
scanning and behavior modeling mode

550
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,500
we also have significant which checks

551
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,480
the security configuration of the target

552
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,299
assets and reports any misconfiguration

553
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,940
that may lead security vulnerabilities

554
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,179
and exploits this model also provides

555
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,700
suggested remediation steps to fix the

556
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,020
identified vulnerabilities or

557
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,918
misconfigurations

558
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,500
so the first offensive module is the

559
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,140
denial of first attack simulator and

560
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,020
used to perform those attacks on various

561
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,179
message types utilizing ship message

562
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,039
generator and IPS Roofing engine

563
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,360
capabilities

564
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,700
and you can perform more effective those

565
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,280
attacks using a predefined dictionaries

566
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,919
for user extension user agent verified

567
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,140
user extension or hijacked accounts when

568
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,640
operated in

569
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,860
automatic scanning and variable modeling

570
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,780
mode which is from other modules

571
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,340
message structure that is particular to

572
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,760
the identified vendor product or version

573
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,700
as a result it can produce sophisticated

574
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,860
messages that anybody engages won't

575
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,158
detect

576
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,360
which can be used to collect zip digest

577
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,220
authentication process

578
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,860
in real time it captures the traffic on

579
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,200
the network and filters the price of

580
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,880
authentication messages and after

581
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,860
extracting the authentication data it

582
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,600
starts the password creating process in

583
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,980
real time

584
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,039
and it can use different methods of

585
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,380
creating passwords such as rainbow table

586
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
brute force and dictionary based methods

587
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,840
and it's an essential tool for testing

588
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,140
kind of cheap passwords that can help

589
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,580
identify weak authentication

590
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,679
configuration that could be excluded by

591
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,780
attackers

592
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,620
VA system which is a

593
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,659
signaling manipulator and can be used to

594
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:07,080
caller ID and manipulate ship signaling

595
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,140
it works as a c proxy intercepting also

596
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,280
rapid traffic between clients and

597
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
servers capturing messages and modifying

598
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,940
specific headers or parameters as needed

599
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,260
and before

600
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,000
forwarding the modified message to the

601
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,580
Target server of course

602
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,799
it can also generate sick messages from

603
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,179
scratch and simulated zip lines

604
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,460
it's possible to carry out one based or

605
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,400
one based polarized finger attacks and

606
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,620
another example of an attack that can be

607
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,380
performed using system is sip

608
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,179
registration Erasure attack against call

609
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,659
centers

610
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,559
we have AFP which is attack scenario

611
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,539
player this is able to perform complex

612
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,140
attack scenarios including

613
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,820
Dr dos and with transmission based

614
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,740
distributed of

615
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,900
using the missing generator and powerful

616
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
person

617
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
and this framework makes it easy to test

618
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,200
and reproduce sophisticated attack

619
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,100
scenarios and it includes eight noble

620
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,799
attack scenarios added to the academic

621
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,799
literature by administrative protein and

622
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,320
it's also possible to develop numerous

623
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,820
attack scenarios using this framework

624
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,740
and

625
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,080
there are additional modules provide for

626
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,580
their capabilities for testing and

627
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,159
attacking systems

628
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,860
shipment in the middle enables

629
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,419
main individual attacks using card

630
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,260
surfing and while C plus generates

631
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,720
irregular messages to test video they

632
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,299
vulnerabilities

633
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,880
RTP e with an RTP meme allows for

634
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,539
eavesdropping and manipulation RTP media

635

637
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,340
we have RTP robot which can be used for

638
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,460
robocalling and speed attacks and auto

639
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,860
dip is an automatic scanner that uses

640
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,720
Behavior modeling

641
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,000
to perform security Audits and these

642
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,159
models are still underdevelopment or

643
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,980
testing phase right now

644
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,620
we have some auxiliary modules

645
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,539
supporting other modules in this

646
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,100
in this profit

647
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,980
IP 16 engine provides three methods for

648
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,980
generating IP addresses including manual

649
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,740
selection from list

650
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,779
random generation and identified of the

651
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,179
current subnet to bypass VIP filtering

652
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,000
if there is in the network

653
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and if you test effectiveness of network

654
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,100
security measures against IPC attacks

655
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,140
message generator which is used to

656
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,720
create standard zip messages that comply

657
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,000
with the RFC specifications and these

658
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,100
messages can be sent to destination or

659
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,779
TCP or UDP

660
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,299
and this also useful for generating

661
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,779
cheap traffic making it helpful for load

662
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,580
testing and robustness testing in

663
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,980
combination of with us

664
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,220
and lastly there is a user-friendly way

665
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,600
that sacrifies the communication

666
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,700
configuration and usage of the various

667
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,279
modules in Mississippi Pro feed

668
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,520
and on the slide I would like to express

669
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,000
my sensor gratitude to the individuals

670
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,700
who have contributed to the development

671
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,860
of Mississippi

673
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,059
so and

674
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,940
as we conclude our discussion voice

675
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,100
Library security and Mrs Pro I would

676
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,100
like to offer an advice for you

677
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,700
remember success insecurity works

678
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,860
requires dedication and hard work

679
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,840
if you are passionate about it

680
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,340
keep learning keep growing and your

681
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,760
passion you'll grow with you

682
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,980
I hope

683
