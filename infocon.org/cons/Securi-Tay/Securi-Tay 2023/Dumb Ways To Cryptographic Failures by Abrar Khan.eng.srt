1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,299
okay so hi everyone first of all my name

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,420
is

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,780
okay so as far as my profession is

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,580
concerned I am currently a technical

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,859
cyber security analyst working at a

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,900
company called techforce it's based in

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,720
Aberdeen and other than that I'm also

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,699
doing my masters and I think I'm hacking

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,039
in cyber security from Aberdeen and

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,720
first of all I would like to really

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,580
appreciate you guys that you have

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,619
specifically taken out your time to be

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,540
on this track you could be anywhere and

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,040
you give me that well thank you so much

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
for that and I'll make sure that you get

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,480
to do do get the value so today the

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,579
topic of uh which are which I'm going to

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,100
this doesn't share my insights that is

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,780
actually dumb ways to cryptographic

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,120
failures in this what I'm gonna do is

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,860
that I'm going to explain some of the

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,000
really dumb ways that we do in real life

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,340
and that actually causes different types

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,500
of cryptographic failures so let's just

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,199
get right into it I'm assuming we have a

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,460
different set of audience everybody

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,159
would have different cells of expertise

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,140
and stuff so for those who don't know

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,180
cryptography is basically just a simple

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,820
science mathematical science that we use

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,920
in our daily life to achieve security

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,260
principles these principles include

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,200
confidentiality Integrity authentication

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
I will ability up to some extent and

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,420
authorizational identity access

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,780
management so I am speaking so much

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,479
so much so yeah we have very different

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,220
techniques through which we Implement

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,080
that we have encryption you have hashing

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,479
you have digital signatures and not only

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,520
these there are so many processes that

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
we have the key exchange session

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,479
maintenance identity management access

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
control then even talk about the

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,460
protocols that yeah TLS transport layer

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,100
security ipsec talk about emails we have

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,280
pgp pretty good privacy so lots of

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,380
things we use cryptography in our daily

49
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,180
life so what is basically a

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,680
cryptographic failure then so

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,899
cryptography failure is basically a

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,140
situation that occurs that when you are

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,880
trying to achieve a security principle

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,439
you don't achieve that let's just say

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,399
you were trying to achieve

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,160
confidentiality and you couldn't because

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,900
you are using an outdated algorithm or

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
someone like that so in that case

59
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,680
basically it's basically a photography

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,319
failure so why cryptographic failures

61
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,480
are important there are two things first

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,819
of all the impact obviously let's just

63
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:24,780
say we are trying to achieve

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
confidentiality and if in case we are

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,580
not able to achieve it you can possibly

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,920
imagine the impact it's not only

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
informational loss not only financial

68
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,319
loss but reputational loss as well and

69
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,080
right now as we speak like you won't be

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
able to feel it unless it happens to you

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,819
for any other person you'll be like okay

72
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,340
it isn't it isn't that much but when it

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,379
happens with you that's when you realize

74
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,780
and the second thing is frequency these

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,760
attacks are really common right now in

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,700
2017 it was on third position with the

77
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,000
name I guess sensitive data exporter and

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,819
the 2021 report it was escalated to the

79
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,340
second position named aspartame failures

80
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,519
so why do these cryptographic failures

81
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,459
occur so there there's one perspective

82
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,400
to this one is that as you can see

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,860
there's a little Miss in here in this

84
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,200
new one this demon is basically like you

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,260
can say the chat landscape it's huge you

86
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,580
talk about there are so many different

87
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,620
companies working in different sectors

88
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,959
you have energy you have Finance you

89
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,480
have sales like so on and so forth

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,599
everyone is using it and everyone has

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,159
different expertise level in technology

92
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,140
some might be using the latest one some

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,940
might be not some might not be using the

94
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,060
latest one and then this one there are

95
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,920
hackers and there are securities users

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,720
this is the term that I have made myself

97
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,459
so Security Solutions are basically

98
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,500
those people who are not so good with

99
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,260
security these are the people like who

100
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,000
are likely to click on a phishing email

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm not trying to still attack people

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,239
here but

103
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,280
but generally these two will go hand in

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,739
hand and this little thing would simply

105
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,060
can't do much much about it so

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,459
there's another approach let's say you

107
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,200
are trying to achieve confidentiality

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,819
and then again you chose the wrong

109
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,799
weapon you chose an encryption algorithm

110
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,339
that was updated problem second one is a

111
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,959
little bit more which I really want to

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,478
emphasize in this complete project or

113
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,639
whatever this presentation is about as

114
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,280
you can see that you there are some

115
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,860
equations right if you see them on an

116
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,780
individual level you will see that the

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,520
steps that we have calculated they are

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,740
exactly right but we have missed one

119
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,840
thing that is basically the guideline

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,580
that you have to follow the board Mass

121
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,979
role basically and just because we

122
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,960
didn't follow that rule we are facing an

123
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,180
anomaly exactly that's what happens in

124
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,220
real life cases

125
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
okay so now let's just see what are some

126
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,320
of the ways downgrades through which we

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,620
achieve those cryptographic figures so

128
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,280
day one that's weak encoding all of the

129
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,540
vulnerabilities that I'm listening I

130
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,759
research them through cwe which is a

131
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,100
common weakness and enumeration Library

132
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,320
you can go search on that everyone has a

133
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,020
number associated with that so as you

134
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,060
can see this one is a code basically

135
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,520
what it does is let's just say you want

136
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,960
to store a password in a configuration

137
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,800
file

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,780
so what you're doing is that it's

139
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,780
getting the password value from the DB

140
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,979
and it's recording it via base64. so we

141
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,919
know that it was encoded in base64. that

142
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,320
actually is not that good because as a

143
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,259
security researcher I know it's just a

144
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,940
matter of like seconds to convert that

145
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,860
back and if you have something like this

146
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,800
at your back end you are doing wrong so

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,979
yeah it provides that security it's

148
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,320
simply like this as much as security

149
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
this Grill is providing to this side of

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
the road it's providing that much so if

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,020
you are deciding to achieve

152
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,660
confidentiality what you will do is uh

153
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,120
encoding in base64 is probably not the

154
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,979
best option to do so

155
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,080
okay the second one is clear text

156
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,620
transmission of sensitive information

157
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,479
again uh we are getting a connection

158
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
with the website and we are doing it

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
through HTTP and you most probably know

160
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,120
that when we are using HTTP all of the

161
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,039
data that we are trying to send or even

162
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,340
receive that goes in clear text and for

163
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,220
anyone who is on that virtual side of

164
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,759
the things can actually shift that um

165
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,440
now you would be saying to me yeah it's

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,960
just so easy like it's like normal thing

167
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,639
we know that actually DP does this

168
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,740
what's the catch in it the catch is that

169
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,180
most of the people actually don't know

170
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,440
we are from the technical background

171
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,960
that's why we are saying it if you just

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,259
go and these are Google dots so if you

173
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,060
just put this command on Google you'll

174
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,160
find out the results that are HTTP

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
websites excluding someone that are

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,300
https you'll see this much results

177
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,919
around

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,380
I don't know what's that number 223

179
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,020
million maybe yeah this much websites

180
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,660
are there that are using HTTP secondly

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,000
there's a tool called curl we as

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,759
developers use it much because we have

183
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,639
to integrate data between web apis and

184
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,819
Sun data API sometimes and what it does

185
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,000
is it has this option called hsts which

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,819
is HTTP script a strict Transport

187
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,919
Security what it does is that it

188
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,380
enforces even if you type HTTP in the

189
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,780
URL what it does is that it will make

190
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,780
the data go and follow https but there's

191
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,539
a problem in this what's that this was

192
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,819
the vulnerability that was published in

193
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,900
October 26 2022 that was exploited just

194
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,300
because of a single problem what was

195
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,460
that the thing is that when you are

196
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,819
trying to pass it a link let's say HTTP

197
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,020
any website and you you can see this dot

198
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,300
right here right it's an IDM collector

199
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,699
idn stands for internationalized domain

200
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,400
name these are basically uh you can say

201
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,360
non-ascii connectors or non-latin

202
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,740
connectors that are not ASCII characters

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,440
so one hacker just find out that if you

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,039
can do this you can bypass this HTS STS

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,560
option so the main point was trying to

206
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,139
tell you that it not obvious always that

207
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,880
if you are using https

208
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,639
in reality https is being used no it

209
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,900
doesn't really you have to make sure

210
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,360
that you are using https

211
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,639
so yeah exactly that's what our friends

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,360
say then hard-coded Keys again so you

213
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,160
see that uh the hash is given here and

214
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,139
the configuration actually checks it

215
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,979
against and if it's right you are good

216
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,719
to go out if it's not then you are not

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,679
good to go

218
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,799
again a simple thing to do you can find

219
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
reversible hashes online just go paste

220
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,779
it and you will find it and it's gone

221
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,120
down so don't compare credentials with

222
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
hard-coded hashes always

223
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,800
reusing launch value okay so this is

224
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
kind of an interesting one because uh

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,180
nonce basically we use in Security in

226
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,399
order to get the identity so let's just

227
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,320
say

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,000
anything any particular thing you like

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,220
let's just say Donuts you like donuts

230
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,560
and I want to be at a family of donuts

231
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,839
and I said that okay if you like donuts

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,060
be the member of my club what I do is

233
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,980
that I give you a secret number and

234
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,779
since whenever you want to connect with

235
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,000
me just add this number so I will know

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,220
that you are a part of my donut club or

237
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,980
whatsoever so the bad thing in this is

238
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,560
that you are not changing the smaller so

239
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,200
let's just say once you have given this

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,839
secret value to a customer or whatever

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,779
your client any attacker if he has that

242
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,580
he can use it because you're not

243
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,680
changing them so he can impersonate as

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,380
that person another example that I can

245
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,240
give is that these lanyards security

246
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
just gave you these and they said that

247
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,720
we want you to wear them if you want to

248
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,820
come to the after party there's no photo

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,760
in here so anybody outside who wants to

250
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
go there can take my lanyard if he wants

251
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,860
the main thing is that security is not

252
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,839
changing these I know this is just for

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,580
one time it's not a good example though

254
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,680
but then again if you are not changing

255
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
balance that's a problem again

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
anyone can impersonate that and for a

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,320
fun fact non-stand for number used only

258
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,019
once so that doesn't really make us if

259
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,820
I'm using it again and again but then

260
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,040
again I said these are dumb ways and

261
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,600
these are actually followed in real life

262
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,640
that's why I'm talking much about it

263
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,940
so using key post expired again if you

264
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,500
are checking the validity of SSL

265
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
certificates so let's just say

266
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,339
um

267
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,080
I met with a

268
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,420
I met with a student he's from Aberdeen

269
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,160
and I want to validate that if he's

270
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
really a graduate student so what he's

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
going to do is he's going to give me his

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,640
ID card now because he's a genuine

273
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,920
student his ID card is valid but let's

274
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
just say it was expired two years ago

275
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,839
like he graduated two years ago this

276
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,339
does not give me you see there's a gap

277
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,279
in this I need to check validity as as

278
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,680
far as the expiry date as well

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,380
so yeah exactly that's what happens if

280
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,480
an SSL certificate is expired an

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,940
attacker can interlude in basically this

282
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,040
attack is called SSL streaming so what

283
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,019
it does is that the attacker basically

284
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,019
intercepts the SSL TLS handshake process

285
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,540
and then presents a fake SSL certificate

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,360
and then creates an established

287
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,940
Collective victim basically

288
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,140
so yeah

289
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,300
so always check the validity plus the

290
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,980
expiry date of the certificate if you

291
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,120
are doing that

292
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,640
each encryption I think I've talked

293
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,980
about it much so yeah basically the same

294
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,899
idea don't use anything that's outdated

295
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,820
such as classical ciphers low key size

296
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,060
using tests or encryption don't just do

297
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,019
that

298
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,959
because Brute Force attacks are common

299
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,640
confidentiality is reached and this is

300
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,920
one key takeaway that always use those

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,140
that has good Randomness first of all

302
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,899
and this is a Content a big concept I'm

303
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,700
going to explain it a little further as

304
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,920
well and then we have the key size as

305
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,959
well that the key size should be strong

306
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,000
enough so and then this one is strong

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,700
non-linearity so non-linearity is in

308
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,980
terms of s boxes as box as you know

309
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,079
stands for substitution boxes we see

310
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,240
those in Block ciphers let's just say a

311
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,180
yes that's in that we use these and

312
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,980
there's a proper concept it's not just

313
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,899
like you are making randomized desk

314
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,459
boxes it's not it doesn't really happen

315
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,480
that way

316
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,399
okay so key exchange without

317
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,720
Authentication

318
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,899
so this one is just a normal example

319
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,579
that I have created let's say there are

320
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,680
two parties A and B they want to

321
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,380
exchange a key a share key how they

322
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,360
actually do that they do it by this way

323
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,700
they have a generator called G and they

324
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,820
have B what they do is that they'll con

325
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,800
uh they'll calculate these values let's

326
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,560
say this B is a random number chosen by

327
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,079
P and this a is basically a random

328
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,560
number chosen by a what they do is that

329
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,420
they'll calculate these publics and then

330
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,040
they will share it with each other and

331
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
then again they'll do the same step and

332
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,839
they will reach a share key

333
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,540
let's discuss it in terms of an attacker

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,360
again if you can see here the attacker

335
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,800
because it's not being authenticated

336
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
what we'll do is that you will generate

337
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,440
a fake key or fly from y side I'm sorry

338
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,019
I label this error x f y this doesn't

339
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,779
really like sounds good because in maths

340
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,240
it boggles my mind also but yeah the

341
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
same concept what he will do is that he

342
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,040
will just distribute these values and

343
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,959
maintain two different connections with

344
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,240
A and B considering and making them feel

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,040
like they are talking to each other well

346
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,139
in reality they are actually not

347
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,899
so yeah exactly the same thing

348
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,040
so always when you are exchanging in key

349
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,779
it's a key element that you need to

350
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,360
authenticate the other party

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,700
incorrect usage of seeds and pseudo

352
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
random number generator so you can sing

353
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,760
it you can see this is a piece of code

354
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,980
and I have used this function called

355
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
Rand

356
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,700
so what this does is that it produces

357
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,920
random numbers according to a initial

358
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,339
generator which is here as strand one so

359
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,440
when this is fixed what it will do is

360
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
that it will always generate the same

361
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,260
like same random values so just like

362
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,839
this so if I have this piece of code

363
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,240
right here no many times no matter how

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,519
many times I run this I'll always get

365
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,620
these values so obviously these are not

366
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,660
random there's a pattern to it and when

367
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,459
there's a pattern to it obviously that

368
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,440
doesn't provides good security

369
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,720
so for security are two random number

370
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,459
generator should be used

371
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,459
and then we have use of RSA without oeb

372
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,920
so RSA as you know is an asymmetric

373
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,680
algorithm basically that you use here is

374
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,180
just a normal exercise that I have made

375
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,160
for you people so you can see there is a

376
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,660
modulus content then there is a public

377
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,420
key and then there are two messages M

378
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,820
and M1 and I have encrypted them using

379
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,699
the harnessing so Cipher is equals to

380
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,100
message raised to the power public key

381
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,519
and modulus yep so we have these two

382
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,220
ciphers can you actually tell

383
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,279
any different identify any pattern

384
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,300
between these

385
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,660
similar

386
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,399
the first one tells me that that

387
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,639
actually that these two ciphers contains

388
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
the exactly the same word that's one of

389
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,620
the details that I can identify from

390
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,480
this and then there's another one as

391
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,820
well what's the other one the other one

392
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
is oh sorry the other one is that the

393
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,120
same word is being encrypted twice in

394
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,820
the same sentence how do I find this

395
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,579
so here if you can see these were two

396
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,040
parts hello world and hello hello so I

397
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,959
encrypted them yeah I know some of you

398
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,940
might be thinking you didn't encrypted

399
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,459
them what you did was this public key is

400
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,180
one

401
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,399
when this is one obviously the message

402
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,500
is going to be less than modulus

403
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,839
but this was just to kind of give you a

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,339
context that happens in this way

405
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,920
obviously if I used large values for RSL

406
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,560
let's just say 1024 bits obviously it

407
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,940
would be it would take a little more

408
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,399
time but then again the idea is that RSA

409
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,220
is deterministic so you need to have a

410
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,680
way to figure it out so yeah those folks

411
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
that were giving your looks and he

412
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,800
doesn't do that I didn't do that what

413
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
he's trying to say so yeah so use a

414
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,899
optical asymmetric encryption padding

415
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,660
always say if you are using RSA though

416
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,540
what I recommend but I'm not a security

417
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,060
um

418
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,339
but generally for encryption asymmetric

419
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,779
ciphers are not that good they are used

420
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,880
for digital signatures or authentication

421
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,199
kind of stuff if you want

422
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,260
confidentiality you can use AES or ECC

423
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,660
uh elliptical curve cryptography for

424
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,839
this and these are just general RSA

425
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,180
issue like there's a common modulus

426
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,519
attack and what you need is that

427
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,259
sometimes you don't even need the

428
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,240
private key in order to get the main

429
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
message out of it and then this one is

430
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,560
chosen ciphertext this one is kind of my

431
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,300
favorite because you see let's say

432
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,339
you're an attacker and you get a cipher

433
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,560
text what you do with it is you multiply

434
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,060
it with a number I call let's say three

435
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,699
and you send that to the receiver now

436
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,320
obviously when the receiver will try to

437
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,300
decrypt that number you will not get the

438
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,040
right number because you fabricated it

439
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,740
so then you can go to the receiver and

440
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,380
say oh I'm really sorry I didn't know if

441
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,819
you got the wrong number can you send it

442
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,859
back to me and I can have a look I don't

443
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,780
know maybe these guys may what kind of

444
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,280
protocols and once you get that

445
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,079
decrypted number back you just need to

446
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,179
divide that with what you multiplied it

447
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,339
and you will get the original decrypted

448
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,380
number without actually having the

449
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,079
private key of that person then again

450
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,540
the whole security of RSA actually

451
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,140
depends on this modulus

452
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,720
yeah if you are able to break it into

453
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,480
two prime factors e and Q generally you

454
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,760
can make your own public or private keys

455
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,220
and then you can do whatever you need

456
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,360
what

457
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,120
so yeah basically basically this is the

458
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,940
whole summary of it so always choose the

459
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,100
right weapon know how to utilize your

460
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,020
weapon to Max there are problems in

461
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,539
every you need to make sure that you use

462
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,640
the right amount of security required

463
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
and have a holistic view of security

464
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,660
because when we are talking about let's

465
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,840
say confidentiality

466
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,360
we are I've only talked about RSA there

467
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,980
are so many other things you can look

468
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,080
forward to but just make sure that you

469
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
have in-depth knowledge of it and you

470
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,440
don't do something like I discussed

471
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,620
earlier uh where I said that you need to

472
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,840
follow the board Mass rumor right you

473
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,340
are just missing the bodmaster rule and

474
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,740
for that you found that normally or

475
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,559
whatever so yeah that's it thank you so

476
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,678
much
