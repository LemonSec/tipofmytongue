1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,899
yeah okay so uh fishing in the age of

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,700
Skynet so that's what's kind of said

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,040
there hi I'm Mark I'm previously

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,360
something you might recognize me from a

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,500
few of the modules I've helped out with

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,719
and for those that don't I previously

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,980
went through the ethical lacking degree

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,420
as I'm sure many of you currently are

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,359
and but never I'm a PhD student focusing

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,859
on machine learning and usable security

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,900
and specifically applying that to the

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,880
language process and it's kind of try

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
and counter fraud and deception on

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
online dating sites trying to understand

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,320
how the person you're speaking with is

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,300
who they really are and then how do you

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,399
warn users when that isn't the case that

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,559
we'll have a chance to come back to that

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,420
now you've had talked before on things

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,340
like cryptography or reverse engineering

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,780
or print testing I want to take a

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,460
slightly different approach that being

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,840
you that you probably aren't concerned

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,280
enough about the impact that AI is going

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,840
to have on your job that they currently

26
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
or in the future and for better or worse

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,440
and I don't mean this in the kind of

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,120
hand wavy Skynet it's your kind of way

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
but rather but like a lot of things AI

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,360
is going to slowly explain to a whole

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,860
bunch of different goals in a way that I

32
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,820
don't think a lot of us are really

33
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,260
prepared for

34
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,420
of course just before we jump in just

35
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,339
kind of make sure we're on the same page

36
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,780
just do a quick refresh from our

37
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,460
artificial intelligence AI machine

38
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,080
learning all that good stuff actually is

39
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,659
and more importantly it's not

40
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
so in the draw defense when we say AI

41
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,700
we're talking about um think for

42
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,740
themselves how to take an improve from

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,180
the environment and then act upon that

44
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,560
so things like machine learning

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,420
meanwhile is understood as applying that

46
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,680
understanding to actual sort of

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,479
practical tasks for things like

48
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,220
analyzing conversations or things like

49
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,020
computer vision having the computer look

50
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,280
at its environment and respond to

51
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
different objects around it

52
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,700
and for the purposes the stock over

53
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,140
it'll words will be using the two

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,340
interchangeably to kind of mean a

55
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,920
computer that could learn to do things

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,720
um no I might be biased but I think

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,799
machine learning is one of the most

58
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,119
exciting Fields you can be working in

59
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
just now as far as I can tell there's no

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,479
one else would be many breakthroughs

61
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,740
happening as quickly as there is here

62
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,140
and however I think it's important to be

63
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,360
upfront and say that um machine learning

64
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,979
and AI often doesn't like what it's

65
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,720
shown in the users okay it's important

66
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,520
to be clear here that AI is not some

67
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,079
kind of radical new technology that

68
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,700
gives computers Divine knowledge to

69
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,200
solve all their problems you know it

70
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,939
isn't a sort of fixed hole for every

71
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,459
issue we might have

72
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,919
um and it's important to say as well it

73
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,599
doesn't render humans Obsolete and isn't

74
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,920
sort of the next step in human evolution

75
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,260
okay as much as it's going to get caught

76
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,060
up in the hype is really important to

77
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,500
stress that you know there is a big jump

78
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,940
between a computer learning to play Pong

79
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,560
and a Terminator across in the human

80
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
skull there is a big link

81
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
in fact when we see it there we're

82
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,680
talking about AI a better example is in

83
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
an extremely simplified way we're

84
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
talking about teaching computers very

85
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
very new electronic pattern recognition

86
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,040
or generally we're talking about

87
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,420
built-in systems that can look at

88
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,220
passive samples of behavior learn from

89
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,420
that and then sort of build and improve

90
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
themselves over time

91
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,900
so for instance if you want to build a

92
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,340
system for map and Roads you would give

93
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,900
it millions of examples of annotated

94
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,360
streets or for recognizing numbers and

95
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
someone's handwriting give it millions

96
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
of variations in the same number or for

97
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,819
potentially building self-driving car

98
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,440
give it millions and millions of hours

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,940
of annotated video with different things

100
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
like pedestrians traffic lights and such

101
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
so they can understand these different

102
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,440
obstacles and their items

103
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,180
and or to prevent more cyber security

104
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,220
context if you want to detect if it can

105
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,900
be a breach new network to give it

106
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,280
millions of examples of packets of good

107
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,560
and bad traffic or for detecting

108
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,780
potentially malicious good millions of

109
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,099
examples of good and bad examples of

110
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,300
good

111
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,800
now that sounds like quite a simple

112
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,080
process in theory we give you know we

113
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,700
tell the computer what we want what we

114
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,959
don't want an Insidious should figure

115
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,580
out the rest for us but in practice

116
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,080
that's quite an often difficult and

117
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,340
challenging proof this it doesn't always

118
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,739
go the way we expect in fact for a one

119
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,180
thing there were certain tasks so it was

120
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,959
thought yeah I could just never

121
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
accomplish things that were too too

122
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
complaint for too abstract or somehow

123
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,260
Too Human for anywhere to learn and one

124
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,659
popularity was chess back in the 1950s

125
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,519
the idea was to Chase had just too many

126
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,900
moves too many different pieces and too

127
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,580
many combinations that would be far too

128
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,140
complicated for any actor to be a human

129
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,519
a case

130
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,739
and then 1996 a system called Deep Blue

131
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,360
difficult master

132
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,580
and so going back to the drum board what

133
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,620
about go go with another board game and

134
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,659
largely played in Asia with hundreds of

135
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,980
pieces and billions of potential

136
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,900
positions it's a game so complicated in

137
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,220
fact even the top human player or

138
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,540
something sometimes struggle to keep

139
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,860
track of what happened in a different

140
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,360
game

141
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,340
and then 2016 a system called alphagodes

142
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
is the world number one

143
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,659
so let's jump right again well there are

144
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,340
if a guy's been short that you're really

145
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,720
good at these sort of restricted rule

146
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,160
Space Systems that we see in things like

147
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,320
work games and such and Partners at the

148
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,279
complete opposite end of the inspection

149
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,260
for that art must be too abstract and

150
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,580
too unique to a human and yeah I could

151
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,539
never reduce it to an R

152
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,280
and generate completely Unique Images

153
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,139
and then in the summer that year GitHub

154
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,820
the Version Control site and finish the

155
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,199
co-pilot for helping programmers write

156
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,699
code by just describing the importance

157
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,040
to be solved and at the end of last year

158
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,199
Google announced imagine if lets users

159
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,759
generate entire videos by just entering

160
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,860
some films

161
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,840
and so if we take all this Milestones to

162
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,979
start putting them together there's a

163
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,180
few interesting points that start to

164
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,340
come forward no more easy to break

165
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,479
through more impressive than the last

166
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,919
but they're also starting to happen

167
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,400
faster and faster

168
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,479
and what the past 20 years old years

169
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,280
have shown us are that not only a lot of

170
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,300
the areas that were thought to be

171
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
completely out of reach of the eye

172
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,540
actually not but the speed with which

173
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,860
they can actually sort of match and they

174
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,419
overcome human ability isn't actually

175
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,100
that long

176
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,720
and so I think I can Edge its way into

177
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
more more and more Fields it can learn

178
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,419
to write its own code if you want to

179
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,919
play every board game tricks when our

180
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,120
edges went to more and more different

181
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,919
kind of roles and jobs

182
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,360
why should cyber security be any

183
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,460
different

184
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,180
and that's what I want to talk about

185
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,680
today the fact that a lot of the new

186
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,120
surrounding the items sort of fall into

187
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,220
two camps either Skynet is hearing this

188
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,020
game over or a threat any kind of

189
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,539
serious threat from the eye is always no

190
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,039
matter what always 10 years away in the

191
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,199
future really do we talk about why AI is

192
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,520
actually doing right now and the kind of

193
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
effect we're getting experience in the

194
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
short term

195
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,840
and a lot of the discussion tends to be

196
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
in the abstract as well either other

197
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
people's jobs will become redundant

198
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,160
because of the eye but your job no

199
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,539
matter what it is will somehow always be

200
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,580
safe in cyber security might stomach one

201
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,080
that falls in it's going to Camp a lot

202
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,520
of fibrous security rules the choir of

203
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
this really sort of deep in Immunology

204
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,759
of systems to understand how they work

205
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,340
and how to keep you secure so in fact it

206
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,020
could be argued even a lot of Security

207
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
will require that human ailment for that

208
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,740
kind of inventive the Box thinking and

209
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,180
finding new ways to exploit and keep

210
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,500
system safe

211
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,419
so when we say about any actualizing the

212
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,800
cyber security the first thing that

213
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
might come mine is some sort of

214
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,860
turbocharged super hacker that can find

215
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,259
holes in any defense and and while we're

216
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,759
not quite there yet I can guarantee that

217
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,259
every nation state is working very hard

218
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,819
on it though

219
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,220
no there's another idea and yeah I could

220
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,780
have a massive impact and one that we're

221
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,280
starting to sort of difficult in with

222
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
now maybe with a little hanging fruit of

223
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,699
cyber attacks but of course I'm talking

224
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,740
about fishing fishing fishing is the

225
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,000
exact kind of thing that AI could have a

226
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
real massive impact on

227
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,900
um not just in medium or short medium or

228
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,120
long term but right now

229
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,979
I want you to think of the last thing

230
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,020
that you knowingly got a fishing event

231
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,819
you know usually if something along the

232
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,259
lines of you're currently compromised

233
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,360
please visit

234
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,900
passwordrefitbank.org you need to reset

235
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,580
your password or the business with your

236
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,979
delivery put this video link to

237
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,720
reschedule or something there was an

238
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,100
issue with your facelift you know view

239
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,020
this video watch it a real PDF to help

240
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,099
verify your details

241
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,080
emails aren't great in fact most of the

242
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,460
time more often not we take a Brewster

243
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,720
in the message realize something doesn't

244
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,979
write and send it straight to the event

245
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,380
or in even better pieces and ultimately

246
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,240
system which we'll come back to Skin's

247
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,620
message and sends it straight to the bin

248
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,960
as soon as it lies in the inbox

249
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,699
and for obvious reasons phishing attacks

250
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,080
are one of if not the most common form

251
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,060
of Cyber attack if they do billions of

252
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,380
messages are sent out to millions of

253
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,240
potential victims it just isn't possible

254
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
for a factor of practice it's going to

255
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,599
explore custom tailored messages and

256
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,639
seamlessly with your inbox and for the

257
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,800
scammer a big button I guess crap is how

258
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,060
many messages you think you craft that

259
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,440
vehicle affected millions of different

260
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
situations so overall then we can

261
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,580
probably feel safe that for the most

262
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,479
part of fishing is something that's

263
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
taken care of either we can continue to

264
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,199
remain

265
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,220
vigilantly automate systems handle it

266
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,360
for us

267
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,680
I said always listening

268
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,979
anyway this is the gpt3 gpt3 is the

269
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,539
latest version of it opening up the

270
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,340
company mentioned earlier is a link is

271
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,440
to larger language model and as much I'd

272
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,639
like to get in the details of how the

273
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,440
systems work for the purposes top a

274
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,080
large language model is a model with a

275
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,160
really good understanding of language

276
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,139
and what also is going to do things that

277
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,639
translate between languages and pick up

278
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,620
different entities and text and they can

279
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,419
also be used to generate content about

280
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,460
whatever topic comes to mind

281
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,740
um absolutely whatever topic comes to

282
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,080
make things like a marketing copy for a

283
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,940
pair of cement shoes or a sauna about

284
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,919
spoiled milk or a hello world program

285
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,319
that wipes your entire hard drive and

286
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,599
absolutely anything including very

287
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,580
convincing fishing videos and something

288
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,500
that was demonstrated by a lemon time

289
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,599
and hop and Defcon 29 just over a year

290
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,940
ago and what they offer showed was the

291
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,740
gpt3 can actually be integrated as part

292
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,479
of the attack process supporting the

293
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,760
human aspect of going off engine sort of

294
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
General also like things like scraping

295
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,339
LinkedIn and Twitter and such for

296
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,920
information GPT gpt3 can actually be

297
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,940
slotted into that part of that effect

298
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,519
process so in fact creating convincing

299
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,620
picture emails is as simple as in

300
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,019
different

301
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,040
instructional condition

302
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,779
um email with some sort of General

303
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,779
context since like the main target name

304
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,000
role and working company to work for in

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
fact the kindness scenarios that AI was

306
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,820
coming up with were quite varied as well

307
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,620
in some cases

308
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,480
the the Eye Center for things like head

309
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,220
hunting emails looking for the joining

310
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,500
our company and have this malicious form

311
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,180
attached obviously see a team of

312
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,160
potentially from HR or Finance looking

313
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,500
for newer employees that might be like a

314
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,820
six month review and asking for feedback

315
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
from them to complete

316
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
an email to actually so convincing in

317
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,519
fact that in some cases victims are 28

318
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,959
more likely it's like on a phishing

319
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,180
email generated by GPT than by a human

320
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,339
one and it's more stressing as well this

321
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,839
hasn't been done with any kind of you

322
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,940
know bespoke custom tailbert model this

323
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,980
is the off-the-shelf mgpt model that

324
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,600
anyone in the film you access to today

325
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,220
for free as well

326
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,100
many standard fishing filtering systems

327
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,779
work based off of measuring how similar

328
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,420
a new email is to non-vision emails if

329
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,800
the attack can openly generate an

330
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,839
infinite number of aviations how easy is

331
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,720
that to detect where would you can start

332
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,860
but of course we all don't just

333
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,300
communicate by email over the past years

334
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,440
many of us have turned into online

335
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,779
conferencing well not even the person

336
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,339
you're hearing or seeing could actually

337
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,380
be here to say they are depicts are

338
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,940
becoming increasingly sophisticated and

339
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
then hard to detect we use machine

340
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,240
learning to Super and cool someone's

341
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
face on top of another and of them you

342
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,180
know what can see and do things that

343
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,580
deliver actually did and there are also

344
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,080
recently been used to synthesize voices

345
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,640
as well how people speak and say things

346
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,279
they never actually did as well

347
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,899
but just a few years ago defects would

348
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,399
have been pretty easy to detect and

349
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,899
typically touch people with sort of

350
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,279
faces I've seen before in front of their

351
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,779
head or these sort of followed by these

352
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,160
strange fact if you'd list me sending

353
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,140
voices and this kind of thing was

354
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,640
expensive as well even on quite well

355
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,899
specked Hardware at the time it could

356
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,940
take days to produce even a short clip

357
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,560
but now the effects are convincing

358
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,060
enough to be synthesized you know in

359
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,100
real time in that just not

360
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
um you're facing head but also your

361
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,220
entire body and voice in real time and

362
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,300
the second kind of things well that can

363
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,680
be used in order to generate the rest of

364
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,000
your head and body based on just a

365
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,740
single image

366
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,480
there may be an extreme example but last

367
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
year during the ongoing conflict in

368
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,540
Ukraine a video surfaced online though

369
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,399
because so um president's license is

370
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,260
surrendering in Russia of course it

371
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,959
wasn't real it was a deep fig head and

372
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,279
voice and hijacked and they can say

373
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
something they never did but what about

374
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,880
in a smaller context maybe like a

375
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,839
colleague or something that you want to

376
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
occasionally messages you've asked to

377
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,500
help them back in their account and of

378
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,700
course we know what online conference is

379
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,200
like if you're on a generate connection

380
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
where they'll do audio jumps out or like

381
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,060
this sort of um static and such how easy

382
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,079
is that to tell the difference between

383
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,420
what's just a network error a multitude

384
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,279
again AI has been used on both sides and

385
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,320
to generate synthetic content losses to

386
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
detector and particular detection was

387
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,800
quite straightforward and to the point

388
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,180
of not even really leading the eye to

389
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,040
help and one of the best cases was if

390
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,360
you look at the defects on the bottom go

391
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,380
you'll feel that when you start

392
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,640
returning to the side their face starts

393
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,959
to sort of collapse in yourself because

394
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,459
they are advantage of information about

395
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,980
what the rest of your head looks like

396
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,720
for now obviously things have progressed

397
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,519
and enhanced and it becomes harder and

398
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,320
harder harder and harder to take these

399
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
kind of things and for a period one of

400
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,380
the best ways to detect defects was to

401
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,060
use Edge detection it's amazing things

402
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,320
like sort of features on the face and

403
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,300
shadows and such and then in calculating

404
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,860
if they made sense in the context that

405
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,740
would never be in tune but again these

406
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,660
systems aren't perfect and right now in

407
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,339
fact some things fully systems this is

408
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,959
easy it's just sprinkling some sort of

409
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,459
static and knowledgeable videos to get a

410
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,800
free pass essentially

411
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,779
still depicts about what are moving

412
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,100
parts and that means it can still get

413
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,019
detected fairly easily the face that

414
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,240
doesn't properly line up or lips and

415
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,500
voices don't quite sync up in time

416
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,120
they're getting harder and harder to

417
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,899
stick but they aren't yet

418
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,160
indistinguishable

419
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,920
and things like gpt3 are good but the

420
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,240
more events are kind of one and done too

421
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,740
I need to generate one phishing email

422
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,660
and then finished

423
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,920
but of course attackers aren't always

424
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
going to work in this way you might you

425
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
might have that kind of first initial

426
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,940
contact to get the interest of your

427
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,440
victim that the pronoun can hand over

428
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
the credentials right there and then but

429
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,440
you do have a hoop that you can build

430
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,240
from

431
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,740
similar it might manually writing

432
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,300
phishing emails though and keeping a

433
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,860
dozens of victims engaged can be quite a

434
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,360
talented for an attacker you've got to

435
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,680
keep track of who you've spoken to what

436
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,880
kind of access you have what information

437
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,500
they're giving you already that's quite

438
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
a challenge to keep track of that and to

439
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,139
manually how those conversations going

440
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,279
back and forth

441
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,079
so overall then it's quite good the

442
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,220
services are kind of bottleneck the

443
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,820
floor attackers

444
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,940
anyway this is a chat GPT and a spin-off

445
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,980
for gpt3 that's a tailored specifically

446
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,899
for a conversation and you and our

447
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,399
prompt and chat GPT will do a pretty

448
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
good job of having a realistic back and

449
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
forth with you and some of you might

450
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,139
already be familiar with chat GPT when

451
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,660
it made the headlines last December then

452
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,339
that little kind of blue overhead the

453
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,019
water for how popular and how capable it

454
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,420
was and challenge GPT would be the end

455
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,800
of the academic essay because you could

456
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,060
generate you know an infinite number of

457
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,620
essays about any topic for any word

458
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,720
count and offers repair of a job because

459
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,860
it could generate an infinite number of

460
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,260
best sellers and stack over for Hudson

461
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,760
ban you through the GPT models because

462
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,260
people would feed in questions asked by

463
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,820
users feed it in the model and then just

464
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,019
paste the response from whatever they've

465
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,940
got

466
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,100
but jpd was also when the rise of these

467
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
models actually became personal because

468
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,459
as I said I do work trying to take fraud

469
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,680
and deception on dating platforms well

470
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,660
within these chat you could keep getting

471
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,980
released people use it to automate

472
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,019
Tinder and they create a bot that would

473
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,519
swipe on every match and then chat GPT

474
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,139
handled everything else coming up with

475
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,240
openings interests jokes completely

476
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,700
remove from the human from the equation

477
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
it's funny and maybe a little bit sad

478
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,420
but I absolutely no doubt the support

479
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,339
should be used by attackers as well like

480
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,839
Amtrak attack over manthraud were

481
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,639
scammers impersonate your true love in

482
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,740
order to coin victims over houses a big

483
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,360
bottleneck for attackers is how many

484
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,519
conversations you keep going once how

485
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,839
many victims you can keep the word in

486
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,399
and exploiting money from

487
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,160
charge apt basically refer to this

488
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,480
but don't worry though because it gets

489
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,399
worse because if we're bringing the gpt3

490
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,019
again familiar that can be used to

491
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,880
generate entire quite realistic profiles

492
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
as well in fact making fake accounts as

493
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,019
simple as given the prompt to create a

494
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,760
comma set for a tabular database of

495
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,500
customer data from a dating app and then

496
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,579
just specifying what kind of information

497
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,320
we want so if you say first name last

498
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,240
name Central interest gender and such

499
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
and in fact I will look at the results

500
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,420
from that you can see that you don't

501
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,459
have to specifier kind of lift the names

502
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,019
or cities or jobs to pick from because

503
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,040
the model already has a good

504
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,420
understanding of what those are and how

505
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,459
they relate to each other pair that with

506
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,920
a bunch of chat GPT instances and you've

507
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,180
got a pretty good way of having a whole

508
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,660
Army of a machine for scam users

509
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,880
I didn't start my PhD that long ago but

510
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,380
AI is moving so quickly in fact that

511
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,639
there's now an entirely new threat that

512
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,440
wasn't present when I started not just

513
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,880
having to attack human attackers but

514
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,680
then how do you also detect AI attackers

515
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,060
so what do we do now there's always been

516
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,560
this kind of back and forth between red

517
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,360
team and blue team and white hat and

518
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
black hat you know good guys and bad

519
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,360
guys just as one side finds a new area

520
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,279
of exploitation those load patches are

521
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,620
the upper hand

522
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,940
it feels like met exploit and arm

523
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,079
retention such you might be familiar

524
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,220
with is helping simplify and

525
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,600
streamlining that sort of exportation

526
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,959
Step then feels like um Chad GPT and gp3

527
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,360
gpt3 helps simplify more of the barrier

528
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,519
to entry for exporting the human aspect

529
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,199
rather than spend hours crafting the

530
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,519
proper profession email you can just

531
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,740
click generate and and see what you get

532
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,820
that the first and what you're after

533
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,860
just roll the dice again and generate a

534
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,660
new one if security gets suspicious you

535
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,100
want it face to face to check things out

536
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,260
you need what a single photo and about

537
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,519
the length of audio the same track of

538
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,519
voicemail to look inside the bar

539
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,019
I mentioned about the phishing emails

540
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,980
showing earlier that were generated

541
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,440
using the default version of jpt3

542
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
well the benefit of large language model

543
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,560
for that is that they can be tailored

544
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,600
for certain purposes because the model

545
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
art has a really good understanding

546
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,540
language but what words mean how do they

547
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,560
relate to each other what kind of order

548
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,360
they appear in it becomes possible to

549
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,180
then extend that towards specific tasks

550
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,860
usually this takes the form of things

551
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,180
like feeding in thousands of research

552
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,680
abstracts in order to someone else's

553
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
research makers or imagine a public

554
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,100
opinion but feed them millions of

555
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,959
different comments in our topic or

556
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,100
inputting the entire content to

557
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,540
Wikipedia in order to extend the model

558
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,820
to understanding in different languages

559
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,339
well if you take gpt3 feed in millions

560
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,079
of examples of fishing emails and then

561
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,279
just start a table of things that are in

562
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,420
the format and structure of the company

563
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,100
you're targeting you've essentially got

564
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,860
an automated spearfishing generator

565
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,300
in fact one of the major challenges

566
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,380
going forward it's going to be

567
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,180
distinguishing between what was made by

568
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,980
humans and what's AI generated will

569
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,120
machine learning continued to be

570
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,100
continuing to develop and improve it's

571
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,240
going to become harder and harder to

572
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,040
tell the difference and for some things

573
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,359
like generate a lot of stories

574
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,679
importance and such that would be a fun

575
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,240
novelty but when we're talking about

576
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,619
phishing in that there's a real serious

577
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,119
growing threat here

578
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,500
but obviously don't leave the stop

579
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,939
thinking that hey I can only be used as

580
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,140
a kind of negative if you're working in

581
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,059
cyber Spirit like just as being used

582
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,280
here for you know harm and exploitative

583
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,020
purposes there is just as many people

584
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,400
and companies working to actually build

585
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,040
AI back systems detect and support these

586
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,199
kind of attacks

587
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,580
it's working as well I don't think AIS

588
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,799
can actually replace security teams

589
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,059
rather it's going to help sort of

590
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,160
streamline and simplify a bunch of

591
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,600
different tasks and processes across the

592
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,700
whole field and both offensive and

593
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,140
defensive

594
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,340
and none of the models I've actually

595
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,720
mentioned here do anything right at the

596
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,059
new proceed rather with enough time and

597
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,500
Care a human can just as easily write

598
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,760
their own incredibly conventional

599
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,620
phishing email and many already do

600
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,900
rather it's this kind of an advances now

601
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,419
that we've seen recently that really

602
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:56,460
disrupt and exploit and disrupt and more

603
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,660
the body of fanfiction when you're

604
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,640
trying to explore that human aspect

605
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,380
here completely super charges this and

606
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,700
give the attacker basically an infinite

607
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,260
number of attempts to deceive but

608
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,840
basically zero effort

609
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,760
like most things is going to slowly work

610
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,780
it through in their life so that's

611
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,580
really noticing if I say Park system

612
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,500
written by an AI would you believe me

613
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,940
which way of telling the difference if

614
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,200
you want this generated by human what

615
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,780
was made by an AI and if you can

616
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,860
what makes you think your current

617
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,260
defenses can

618
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,860
thank you

619
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,440
I will say and two things before we've

620
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,460
got questions

621
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,720
um I'll address in the interest in on

622
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,919
getting sued that none of the companies

623
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,600
will mention installment condone using

624
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,340
their models for the purposes and please

625
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,440
do not try and make malware phishing

626
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
emails for any other models of shown and

627
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,919
and if you're looking for some bonus

628
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,020
content and such um you can find all the

629
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,280
links and references and such at the

630
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,780
site at this link

631
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,520
yeah guys have any questions I'm happy

632
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,220
to have a question about uh the

633
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,980
artificial intelligence for video and

634
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,679
voice generation how good is the

635
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,900
artificial intelligence

636
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,539
how good is the algorithms that

637
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,460
recognize when a voice or video is

638
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,120
artificial intelligence and also like

639
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,880
this network for every type of person

640
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,400
regardless of the language Race location

641
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,919
is it more prevalented or like Western

642
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,380
World and English language rather than

643
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,480
the the rest of the world because you

644
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,580
mentioned there was a as a lensky yeah

645
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,200
the landscape incident and is there is

646
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,240
there any artificial intelligence so far

647
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,140
that is undetectable by by humans and

648
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,720
you need a special type of detector and

649
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,940
my last my last thing to the question is

650
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,860
do you think in a few years there would

651
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,200
be for example when somebody Rings your

652
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,299
phone there will be a built-in detector

653
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,000
in Android that says potential AI voice

654
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
generated or something

655
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,100
yeah no that's fantastic actually

656
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,780
um in terms of what your comment about

657
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,520
um

658
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,020
building models aren't just sort of

659
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,280
catering to like the Western Hemisphere

660
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,200
and that that's a big issue kind of

661
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,520
across the building a lot of the data

662
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,080
things that Wikipedia now are primarily

663
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
in English so when you're trying to then

664
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,980
build models that have an understanding

665
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,539
of foreign languages or cultures and

666
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,400
that there is quite a deficit of actual

667
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
information that can be used for that

668
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,240
and which is quite a big issue across

669
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,740
the whole field

670
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,600
um but in terms of detection and such

671
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,959
it's

672
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,120
or other kind of synthetic and media and

673
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,520
right now the sort of approaches were

674
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,440
used to move like Edge detection such as

675
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,059
usual the best way for picking something

676
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,620
like that up

677
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,080
um but as I said you can there is sort

678
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,820
of a real number of types of attack that

679
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,200
you can do against models like these

680
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,179
that will use things like sort of sub

681
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,460
pixels of noise and such where to the

682
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,260
person to a human looking at it that

683
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,640
still looks like a regular normal image

684
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,559
but from the if you try to detect that

685
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,200
with an AI it just looks like static

686
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
so it becomes quite challenging then of

687
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,700
how you build systems that are

688
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,080
um that work in order for humans trying

689
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,299
to interact with media and such as we do

690
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,280
normally but often in a way that AI can

691
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,020
also work through that and pick up one

692
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,299
if there's something not quite right

693
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,900
it's okay just to just to

694
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,960
also mention that yeah as as at this

695
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,299
point are we are we yet at this point

696
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,860
where you could receive a call from

697
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,380
someone and then it can be like it can

698
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,440
be I know the person that claims and as

699
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,480
I said would there be uh you think like

700
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,980
in the year or two or five there would

701
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,039
be like a security software when people

702
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,860
spoilers that would be that are supposed

703
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,980
to recognize that and give you another

704
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,480
because you could see if this becomes a

705
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,460
problem then you decide to do it yeah

706
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,820
and I would if there isn't already from

707
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,900
an employees I would definitely think

708
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,820
that that's in progress and I'm sure

709
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,799
many of you will get inflicted fake

710
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,240
delivery messages and such that are

711
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,500
picked up right as it gets to your phone

712
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,659
this is probably a scam and I would

713
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,740
definitely see something like that

714
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,360
happening where this doesn't sound like

715
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,460
Earth's um either it's picking up based

716
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,780
on the number that's calling you or sort

717
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,280
of analyzing it at real time I think

718
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,039
definitely somewhere being explored as

719
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,059
well

720
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,580
I'm just speaking about voice no not for

721
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,200
masses because there is um like full

722
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,940
text messages but I'm just speaking

723
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,860
about analyzing the the voice that's

724
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,240
coming yeah so the same kind of systems

725
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
that we pick up on if a sort of regular

726
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,840
text message is a scam I think would

727
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,240
also then get extended into analyzing if

728
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,320
you're actually phoning someone from

729
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,539
it's one of you of the sentence the

730
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,460
synthetic or something this is quite

731
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,480
right I think they would definitely

732
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,780
definitely be working on there

733
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,299
okay thank you

734
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,520
yeah so

735
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,360
um Chad GPT uh one thing that makes it

736
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
kind of awkward even for

737
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,740
um

738
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,880
positive nice uses yeah is that if it if

739
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,080
it so much as things you're doing

740
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,460
something even a little bit suspicious

741
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,140
it clams up and refuses to talk to you

742
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
yeah

743
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,500
um

744
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,179
is uh

745
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,280
is there evidence that because you

746
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,320
mentioned that people using chati BT for

747
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,000
automating communication with people and

748
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,320
dating apps or scamming stuff like that

749
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,299
uh is there evidence that people have

750
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,740
found reliable ways to get around this

751
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,559
to actually use it for this

752
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,960
so that's right yeah people were using

753
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,039
it for

754
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,520
um not on purposes but what tended to

755
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,799
happen was when it came back in December

756
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,200
um it was sort of delicious it might

757
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
seem like quite a neutral state of it

758
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,380
yeah it would accept absolutely anything

759
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,880
if you're into that like a lot of

760
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
examples are given there I don't

761
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,340
actually think we've run anymore if you

762
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,260
asked it to do that yeah um so
