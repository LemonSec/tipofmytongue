1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,860
hello don't know why you've signed

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,379
yourself up for this this is it's not

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,780
the most invigorian topic and the one on

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,480
track one sounds much better but yeah so

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,700
uh we'll go for it uh I just introduced

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,379
myself my name is George I'm a student

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,420
at Napier so I've come from the lovely

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,279
City of Edinburgh today

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,640
um I'm disabled so I'm canoe you put the

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,279
two together you get paragonist and in

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,080
terms of computing and cyber security I

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,580
like data law I like computer more I

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,040
like the boring stuff

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,079
um it's more of an academic presentation

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,460
compared to the other stuff you've been

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,780
in so I have actually sat down and done

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,180
the research I've got sources I've got

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,219
citations I was lazy so they're all at

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,739
the end but I can tell you which bits

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:44,520
what

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,620
um and there's gonna be a lot of um talk

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,940
about some of the freedom information

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,920
requests I've done if you want those

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,719
there are a couple that I can't give out

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,100
because they're either being contested

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,520
with the Ico at the moment or their they

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,379
contain data and information I can't

28
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,539
reproduce um but I can share other ones

29
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,039
I'll put my contact details at the end

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,379
and people can get in touch

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,000
so we're going to go over date

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,799
projection history the date protection

33
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,420
act 1998 so we're gonna go all the way

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,220
back before I was born

35
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,140
um date protection at 2018 you can see a

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720
pattern here UK gdpr and freedom

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,520
information and

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
my free movie face requests and

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,900
conclusion as well before we start I

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,759
want you to think from the title about

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
you think back to these

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
acts on the screen here and I want you

43
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,340
to think about whether you think they're

44
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,840
still fit for purpose it doesn't matter

45
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,520
if you don't know much doesn't matter if

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,259
you know everything about them

47
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,299
but just think are they still fit for

48
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,000
purpose in any way that you believe just

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
just in your head come to that

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,420
conclusion and then hopefully

51
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,220
I might change your mind I might

52
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,680
reinforce it or am I completely confuse

53
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
you and hopefully it'll be one of those

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,799
three

55
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,659
um just do some definitions for people

56
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,000
who don't know I'll let you read them

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,259
um I don't really want to read off the

58
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:55,979
screen

59
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,920
but just three acts basically to go

60
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,240
through them

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
um and stuff and so obviously we've got

62
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,360
the deck production apps up there the UK

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
gdpr um which lots of people don't know

64
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,440
about that was a very sneaky post-brexit

65
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,260
law it essentially takes the EU elements

66
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,459
of

67
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,660
um the of the data protection act and

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,280
removes them and puts them into a UK

69
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,780
context that's all it does it doesn't

70
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,340
really do that much and then free of

71
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,560
Information Act uh 20 that should be two

72
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,020
thousand don't know why I put 2018 uh

73
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,120
that's my mistake it is two thousand

74
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,739
um and Scotland has its own Freedom

75
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,140
Administration act as well

76
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,720
um so we'll go over a bit of history of

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
um debt protection in the UK so we start

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,140
off with the European Declaration of

79
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,519
Human Rights

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,800
um that is a un

81
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,959
um thing but it was adopted by your

82
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,700
result of 1948 that gives you the right

83
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,560
to privacy it's why that's important so

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,879
we have an inherent right to privacy

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,980
that's where we you know we get the idea

86
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,959
of a privacy notice from privacy policy

87
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,420
obviously that's encoded in law but the

88
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,920
idea of that right to privacy that right

89
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,840
to having your information secure it's a

90
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,700
human right so it's not something that's

91
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
illegal right it's a it's a human right

92
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,540
so if people are breaking that then

93
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,760
we've got a bit of a problem with them

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,780
um then there was a debt protection

95
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,180
prevention almost 40 years afterwards

96
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,280
we're very slow

97
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,599
um in Computing to catch up with stuff

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,980
sometimes

99
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,480
um but that was the first day of doing

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,519
prevention then there was the UK data

101
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,980
protection act uh from 1984 it was an EU

102
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,599
directive

103
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,879
um then you ended up with the next EU

104
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,860
directive and you can see the pattern we

105
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,140
get a debt protection act out of it we

106
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,379
get the UK freedom information act which

107
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,900
um caused if anybody knows the

108
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,879
um MP expenses Scandal because we got to

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,019
know everything about what they were

110
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,599
spending the money on and then we got

111
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,959
another directive and another UK law

112
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,940
um and you can see the pattern here

113
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,120
ended up with the production Act

114
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
um and then we left the EU that's a very

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
important

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,700
um thing to note and we ended up with UK

117
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,060
gdpr so nice and simple how we got there

118
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,940
pretty easy stuff

119
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,220
intensity 1998 introduced eight key

120
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,480
principles

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,940
um so the first one that said that data

122
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,680
must be processed fairly and lawfully

123
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
and you can see if you've read um the

124
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,519
debt collection 2018 you can see the

125
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,079
comparison you can see that the

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,100
differences

127
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,779
um I haven't actually got these

128
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,940
principles for 2018 because it's not

129
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,560
really relevant to what I want to talk

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,580
about

131
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,800
um but it's looking at what changed from

132
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,880
1998. and moving on from that so there's

133
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,220
the specific and lawful purpose there's

134
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,040
about things not being excessive so you

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,540
know they don't need your middle name

136
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,759
for them to take you know like a bank

137
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,259
payment for example they only need your

138
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,360
first and last name or you know they're

139
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,220
signing you up to a mailing list they

140
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,479
really need your first name they don't

141
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,919
need your last name they don't need any

142
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,060
of that so

143
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,320
that's what they're talking about with

144
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,820
excessive data they're also talking

145
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,500
about things like you know they're

146
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,699
sending you an email they don't need

147
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,780
your address they don't need your

148
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,800
postcode they don't have anything for

149
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,020
that the date must be accurate so you

150
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,759
have a

151
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,800
um you have a right or you still do

152
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,360
because he's carried across but you

153
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
haven't you did and you still do you

154
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,940
have this right for your data to be

155
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,340
accurate it was a very interesting case

156
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,780
um somewhere else in the year I can't

157
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,759
remember where where someone had signed

158
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,699
up to Tinder and they were they were

159
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,960
over the age of 18 but they'd

160
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,300
accidentally put their date of birth in

161
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,820
under 18 and they successfully took

162
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,800
Tinder to court over the fact that they

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
wouldn't change their data because and

164
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,240
this was this was pre-2018 because that

165
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,220
data must be accurate and so even if

166
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,740
you've given this accurate data you have

167
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,960
a right for it to be amended

168
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,580
um and then not kept longer than

169
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,600
necessary

170
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,699
processing accordance appropriate

171
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,280
measures and that protected by

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,380
appropriate measures that's very like

173
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,840
um not very specific and if anybody was

174
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,300
in track to 11 o'clock with Richard

175
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,120
Hollis fantastic talk talking about how

176
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
the cyber security industry is broken

177
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,900
and that it kind of touched on that a

178
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,979
little bit about the fact they talk

179
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,060
about appropriate measures but there's

180
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,400
no standards for it and there's no kind

181
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,560
of regulation of that and we'll talk

182
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,300
about that in a second as well and you

183
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,160
can't transfer data outside of Europe

184
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,199
and if you do you need like you needed a

185
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,300
data passport essentially

186
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,340
um so what works out of that

187
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,259
um it served as a reference model so it

188
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,820
harmonized data protection principles

189
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,340
and to a certain extent it enabled an

190
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,400
internal market for personal data so it

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
allowed people to they weren't against

192
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,080
people selling data they they the EU

193
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,539
appreciated that people do that it's a

194
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,340
market and exists

195
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,919
um but it created this this Market of

196
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,900
being able to sell personal data within

197
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,699
the EU and so you had these big

198
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,120
companies that are so John was to just

199
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
sell data within the EU so they would

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
take American data or they take EU data

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,300
and sell it the other side because they

202
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,539
had these special passports

203
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:50,460
it harmonized the principles

204
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,919
um so it essentially it was a

205
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,380
principle-based framework and so in a

206
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,620
turn it prevents flexibility it was also

207
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,479
technology neutral so it didn't depend

208
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,300
what what you were using it was just it

209
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,580
could be post or you know it could be

210
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,840
like you're sending a letter to somebody

211
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,639
and you have to keep you know you've got

212
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,680
this big address book and it's physical

213
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,600
physical paper address book you still

214
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,220
have to keep that under the data

215
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,139
protection act compared to you know you

216
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,819
might have an Excel sheet or a database

217
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,139
instead

218
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,479
um and it approved awareness as well of

219
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,460
data protection concerns within Europe

220
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,000
and within the UK specifically but what

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,620
didn't work um so there was a Supreme

222
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,979
Court case of Lloyd Lloyd is the name of

223
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,120
the person who brought the class fashion

224
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,979
lawsuit versus Google I'm very gonna

225
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,539
with the touch on this so the case was

226
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,520
under the date pressure in 1998 because

227
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,940
it was the the incident occurred in 2015

228
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,280
and essentially Google on iOS devices on

229
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,979
Safari had a third-party cookie that

230
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,280
they forced onto Safari and Chrome

231
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,319
and essentially had no option to get rid

232
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
of it and it was harvesting data and it

233
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,460
was it was giving that data to Google

234
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,560
without your permission it never asked

235
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,539
for that permission it never told you it

236
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,160
was doing it and it wasn't until some

237
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,139
cover people found out that they got in

238
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,419
trouble and essentially they got fined

239
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,699
but people were annoyed about the fact

240
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,460
that their data was used and misused

241
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,139
and they wanted some justice and

242
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,520
unfortunately

243
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,620
um in the date production of 1998 and

244
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,220
still in the day project 2018 there's no

245
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,259
um there's no there's no value to data

246
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,699
but there is value to data because

247
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,319
otherwise companies wouldn't want it

248
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,419
they wouldn't want to sell it

249
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,419
um so essentially it meant that it made

250
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,919
it impossible to quantify the cost of

251
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
personal data features so there was no

252
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,539
there was never a payout for victims

253
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,399
um the link between personal data and

254
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,779
privacy issues

255
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,380
um it was a real it was really unclear

256
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,880
uh that's essentially it there was there

257
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,580
was no kind of link between the two so

258
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,300
there was no kind of

259
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,339
insinuation that there was a difference

260
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,620
between people's personal data and the

261
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,640
rest that would come with it they were

262
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,019
just kind of seen as two things they

263
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,040
weren't seen as something that could be

264
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,140
linked there was there was limited

265
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,740
transparency so the um the measures

266
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,320
aimed at prevailing transparency of the

267
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,519
processing

268
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,440
lowering consistent and they're

269
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
ineffective and this is from a report to

270
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
the information commissioner's office so

271
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,779
these aren't my opinions these are um

272
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,300
academics and legal experts opinions and

273
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,519
that I've taken from Readings I've done

274
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,380
um There are rules on their expert

275
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,720
exports and they were really outdated so

276
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
they were written in 1998 that was when

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,220
that's when the law was enacted but they

278
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
were written as if they were in the

279
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,140
1950s 1960s is what the report said

280
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,480
um and it was just it just didn't work

281
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,420
this is the best way to put it the tools

282
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,360
that you had for data export they they

283
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,519
were clunky and cumbersome they were you

284
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,620
were given them by the EU So within the

285
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,260
1990s within the directive there were

286
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,880
this list of tools that you could use

287
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
and they were named and that's a very

288
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,880
odd thing and they were they were old

289
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,860
because these companies knew that you

290
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,260
didn't have to

291
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,700
um what's the word I'm looking for you

292
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,720
didn't they couldn't you couldn't use

293
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,820
something else so if there's 20 tools

294
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,980
you're going to use one of the 20 and

295
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,300
some countries were allowed to use some

296
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,980
tools and some were not allowed to use

297
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,779
others because they're the way they'd

298
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,700
interpreted into their data protection

299
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,680
act

300
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,420
um the date protection authorities as

301
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,680
well known instead of information

302
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,920
commissions are now own they didn't have

303
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,500
like strict accountability and

304
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,200
enforcement it was kind of vague and the

305
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,519
EU again it's a directive it was

306
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,820
guidance it wasn't law so it meant that

307
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,680
the UK can interpret it completely

308
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,300
differently and actually then it

309
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,560
wouldn't be consistent wouldn't line up

310
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,940
with Europe

311
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,380
and then you've also got to look at the

312
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,420
definition of entities

313
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,279
um it was simplistic and static there

314
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,620
was no Dynamic kind of to it and so now

315
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,880
they've broken it down into three and

316
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,959
we'll go through those in a little bit

317
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
but there was no there was no definition

318
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,160
of them so you didn't know who was a

319
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,420
data controller you didn't know who was

320
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,860
the processor you didn't actually know

321
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,360
whether you were a data subject or not

322
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,000
or whether actually you were a you know

323
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,680
a middleman

324
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,560
um and you didn't know who owned so a

325
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,420
company could in a way in a loophole

326
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,760
they could claim ownership over a piece

327
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
of your data and that would mean that

328
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,459
you couldn't give it to another company

329
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,680
even though it's your data which is a

330
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,779
bit of a weird one and it still exists

331
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,380
to an extent but not in the same way

332
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,579
um and there were lots of other minor

333
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,680
weaknesses the reports out there it's on

334
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,060
the sources slide

335
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,700
um do have a look it is quite a if you

336
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,440
just search up what was wrong with the

337
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,720
data protection 1998 it's on the it's

338
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,399
just a PDF on Google it's it's quite

339
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,500
interesting

340
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,959
it the date prediction act um it updated

341
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,380
and replaced the DPA 1998 essentially

342
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,459
um it sets out the framework that we've

343
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,720
got in the UK

344
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,339
um it's pretty simple

345
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,500
um it was a lot simpler than the 1998

346
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
and other previous laws and actually it

347
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,640
was a lot more simple than the rest of

348
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
the usuals as well

349
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,959
in terms of diet protection

350
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:52,680
um

351
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,740
it it was amended by in 2021 by

352
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,620
regulations of us leaving the EU and

353
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,000
there's three separate date protection

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,820
things as a general processing regime

355
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,440
which comes under GPR

356
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
and there's two separate for law

357
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,880
enforcement and intelligence agencies so

358
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,820
you have limited rights as a data

359
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,880
subject under these two so they can

360
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
basically those Clauses say they can do

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,740
what they want especially this one here

362
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,240
so the intelligence Services can

363
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,320
basically do whatever they want with

364
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,300
your data because you can't go and ask

365
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,980
them if they've got data on you because

366
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,079
it's National Security whether you think

367
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
that's right or not it it probably isn't

368
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,779
um but that's the law and so you can you

369
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,920
know you could contest that you could

370
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,800
change that but it's very nice

371
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
um because you can claim anything about

372
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,500
National Security and get away with it

373
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,420
and they created and I say creative

374
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,740
Loosely because there was already an

375
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,600
information commissioner

376
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,339
um but they basically recreated the

377
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,660
information commission's office or the

378
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,940
Ico as other people in that just to

379
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,160
briefly go over the UK gdpr

380
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
um it sets out some key principles a

381
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,019
controller there is someone who manages

382
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,060
the data processor is the person who

383
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,040
quite physically goes through it and

384
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,100
processes it and as data subject is the

385
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,180
person whose data it is and

386
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,700
yeah it defined what personal data is

387
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,220
it's any any data that could

388
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,160
um identify you directly or a collection

389
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,440
of data that could together when you

390
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,019
piece them together they could

391
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,420
um identify you as well and so what

392
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,680
works out these and these are again

393
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,300
these are from academics I've spoken to

394
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,160
these are from just people's opinions as

395
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,899
well so there's a better understanding

396
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,540
of data protection and your rights as a

397
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,100
data subject and that that is true

398
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,240
there's a lot more rights there's a lot

399
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
more guidance we're in this kind of

400
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
newer age of the internet than we were

401
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,160
in 1998 there's a lot more access to

402
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,440
information and things like that there

403
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
was more transparency as well so you can

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,940
do a subject access request now and you

405
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,500
can Hound a company and ask for all the

406
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,180
data you want on yourself often they're

407
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,680
a little bit tricky

408
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,180
um because you've got to prove that

409
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,700
you're yourself and if you for example I

410
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,260
don't know like

411
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,120
um you want you know you were like eight

412
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,500
and you signed up to color penguin and

413
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,700
you want to see all the data they've got

414
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,560
on that you it's a bit tricky to prove

415
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,480
that you are your eight year old self if

416
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,800
for example you've lost access to your

417
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,959
email account or something like that but

418
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,339
that's an issue with that specific

419
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,420
section

420
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,339
um there's more concrete rules um the

421
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,440
very very specific and they basically

422
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,540
say you have to follow your privacy

423
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,220
policy if you breach your privacy policy

424
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,260
and then some other bits are not so

425
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,880
specific so the you know if they're

426
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
saying it's an excessive use of personal

427
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
data excessive is not a it's not a

428
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,940
quantitative term it's qualitative so

429
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,339
you can't really pick and choose

430
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,680
um you have to pick and choose what you

431
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,300
want to do with that

432
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,639
but what doesn't work so I spoke to a

433
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,199
number of academics I was focused with

434
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,959
some MPS as well and

435
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,339
um kind of got their opinions on stuff

436
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,139
so one of the things that said was there

437
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,120
was a lack of ease of understanding so

438
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,839
it becomes very complex very quickly

439
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,339
um and it does the minute you kind of

440
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,199
look at a piece of case law and it's

441
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,420
just like but this is what it says here

442
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,399
you look at the act itself it's very

443
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,920
very very very short and then you look

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,139
at what the Ico is saying it's like how

445
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,639
do you get all this from this there's

446
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,380
not much at all

447
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,420
um the public very often misunderstand

448
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,699
gbr I see it all the time and if you're

449
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,380
a member of a community Facebook page

450
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,420
that's probably the best place um from

451
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,860
back home where I'm from

452
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,899
um there's one and people if somebody in

453
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,000
a like a local Corner Shop puts up CCTV

454
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,639
young children immediately it's gdpr

455
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,740
gdpr you can't do this and actually you

456
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,360
can't you can put photos out of people

457
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,220
who you think have stolen from your shop

458
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,720
you have to have proof that there's

459
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,040
still an obviously because they can test

460
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,620
it but that's a misunderstanding in a

461
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,880
way

462
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,320
um subject access requests and we'll

463
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,760
touch on this one we go to like the

464
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,040
slides about what MPS believe need to

465
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,980
change but subject has some requests are

466
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,420
often misused by companies against

467
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,420
journalists so um one example is in the

468
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,279
wake of the Ukraine war

469
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,199
um a huge number of Russian oligarchs in

470
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,940
the uks London's often called London

471
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,839
grad

472
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,860
um because in the money laundering

473
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,120
things like that that happens in London

474
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
because of of Russian money and you look

475
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,699
at some of the things that MPS were

476
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:03,720
saying and they can get away with it

477
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,399
they've got parliamentary privilege but

478
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,540
journalists were saying well this

479
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,000
person's got this house in London

480
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,740
um you know we need to sanction them and

481
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,300
then all of a sudden they're getting

482
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,579
slapped with subject access requests

483
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,899
because they're expensive to process

484
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,839
they reckon it's about 500 pounds per

485
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,519
request which is a lot of money if

486
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,199
you're a freelance journalist or you're

487
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,060
a newspaper and you're you know they'll

488
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,160
send several of them so they'll get

489
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,980
multiple law firms and they'll get you

490
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,139
know 20 30 multiple law firms and all of

491
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,639
a sudden that's 15 grand if you've got

492
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,100
30 law firms or one person and they'll

493
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,380
get same piece of information sent out

494
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,320
several times but once you've built the

495
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,180
subject access request you have to

496
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,519
delete it so you can't then go back and

497
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,560
get it again if that makes sense

498
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,639
um so it's one of the things that you've

499
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,959
then got to build it again and again and

500
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,860
again

501
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,839
um in terms of prosecutions

502
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,139
um the Ico keeps the fines that it gives

503
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,980
out

504
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,680
so the money despite the money's being

505
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,199
given to a public agency to a public

506
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,300
Authority and despite the money the fact

507
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,220
that the data is the Public's because

508
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,559
it's their individual data they keep all

509
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,679
the money so that's how the Ico receives

510
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,260
no Public Funding whatsoever they work

511
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,059
that the way they work is they work off

512
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,099
the money that they receive in funds so

513
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,260
they're reliant on people breaking data

514
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,000
protection which kind of begs the

515
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,260
question of well are they the best

516
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,760
authority to deal with it then and to

517
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,339
give the guidance because surely if the

518
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,480
way they make money in the way they

519
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,620
exist financially is by Prosecuting will

520
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,500
not prosecute but finding then surely

521
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,179
they want people to get fined because

522
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,160
that's otherwise they wouldn't exist and

523
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,020
they wouldn't have their jobs

524
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,679
um

525
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,880
and there's only ever been one

526
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,559
prosecution under the DPA and that was

527
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,980
where someone took it was like 270

528
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,840
people's medical records at the hospital

529
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,500
on purpose to then sell that data on

530
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,480
um he did it maliciously

531
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,940
um and he did it over three years I

532
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,820
think and they prosecuted him under the

533
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,179
2018 and it was last year I think he um

534
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,880
late last year I think he went to jail

535
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,460
um and it was a big fine as well but

536
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,500
you know that's one prosecution and you

537
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,539
look at the number of data breaches and

538
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,640
you go but they know these happen they

539
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,960
know they're you know they know they're

540
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,000
at risk and they don't do anything

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,380
um you see it in the news you see that

542
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,299
companies have have suffered from the

543
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,760
same attack twice within the same year

544
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,780
and it's like why haven't you done

545
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,919
anything

546
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
so you kind of you can beg that question

547
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,980
as well

548
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,480
um and whether you think that's

549
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
something that needs to change that's up

550
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,179
to you

551
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,000
um I spoke to two MPS I spoke to Nadine

552
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
dorries I spoke to

553
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,960
um Bob Sealy as well

554
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,720
um they were both very nice and um

555
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,460
funnily enough um when I was doing my

556
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,380
research and I'll

557
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,900
I'll voucher Bob here he I obviously

558
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,340
live in Edinburgh and he invited me down

559
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,780
to the Isle of Wight

560
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,740
um because he thought I was a

561
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,660
constituent which did make me chuckle

562
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,179
but I spoke to Nadine Doris about her

563
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,440
deck protection digital report

564
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,419
information bill when was Secretary of

565
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,280
State for culture

566
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
um and essentially it would make

567
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,880
government data less available to

568
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,799
individuals now I've you'll see in a

569
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,660
couple slides I've had a right pain with

570
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,559
the government trying to get information

571
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,760
off them

572
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,039
um that they have to give out

573
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,039
um but she wanted to change that so that

574
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,660
you couldn't make a 3D information

575
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,580
request to the government so you can ask

576
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,740
them for data that they have to give out

577
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,240
anyway

578
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,980
um which is a bit of a confusing one and

579
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,660
she also wanted to change rights so that

580
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,120
you'd actually get more rights

581
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
um as an individual so you could

582
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,539
actually do selective processing so if

583
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,620
for example you are signing up to

584
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,960
um like Netflix

585
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,520
um for example

586
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,100
um actually it's probably a bad example

587
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,660
um

588
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,760
like you're signing up to something and

589
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,020
it's it's digital you don't have to pay

590
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,640
for it right but you give your email

591
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,020
address and then you want your personal

592
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,360
you they want your mailing address they

593
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,280
want your for example National Insurance

594
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
number they want your passport number

595
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,880
they don't need all that but they might

596
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,860
stop you from using your their service

597
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,960
if you don't give them that

598
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,940
so that was what selective processing is

599
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,440
and it'd be things like if you're using

600
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
Google or YouTube and you can you can

601
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,500
pick and choose so you could say to

602
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,200
YouTube I don't want you to recommend me

603
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,539
stuff based off this YouTuber that I

604
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,460
watch because that's one piece of data

605
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,840
they're collecting value so that that's

606
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,700
you know there's a negative to that and

607
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,320
there's a positive to that as well and

608
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,000
then Bob sealey's bill it's a big long

609
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,780
one

610
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,799
um because it's only had its first

611
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,880
reading and essentially it would change

612
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,559
the way that subject access requests

613
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,460
work

614
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,020
um because of the way that then it's

615
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,059
used against journalists

616
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,039
um to briefly touch on the freedom

617
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
information act basically it provides

618
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,940
access to information held by public

619
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,500
authorities there's two ways it does

620
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,340
this

621
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,780
um they're obliged to publish certain

622
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,640
information so any information about

623
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
their operations that isn't deemed

624
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,360
confidential or national security they

625
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,280
have to publish

626
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,900
um and then members of the public are

627
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,720
also encouraged and entitled to request

628
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
information for public authorities

629
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
um Scotland's covered by the Freedom of

630
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,620
Information Scotland act 2002 and the UK

631
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,380
one as well so the Scotland one just

632
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,419
sets out some more rights for you but it

633
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,760
builds on the 2001. um and it means that

634
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,320
there's a couple more public authorities

635
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,360
such as universities

636
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,000
um that have to think so here are my

637
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,220
freedom refresh requests I said 343

638
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,900
pressure requests and I might be

639
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,160
thinking I have too much time on my

640
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,660
house and I do

641
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,179
um 242 of these were accepted so by

642
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,039
accepted I mean I got the information I

643
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,760
wanted

644
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,679
98 were rejected I asked government

645
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,360
departments the UK House of Commons

646
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,340
Scottish universities and some other

647
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,659
public authorities like I haven't

648
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,860
actually put in

649
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,600
um because I never heard back from them

650
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
um because I sent them to like and I'll

651
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,480
receive them after the talk so I think

652
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,039
it's 28 days they have to get back to

653
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,120
you

654
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,400
um and some of them I received on the

655
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
last date which was all the government

656
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
departments might add so I received

657
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,740
probably about

658
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,140
a hundred hundred and something emails

659
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,340
in one day I'm a University email

660
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,020
account from the government

661
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,280
um and I did get an email from the

662
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,900
University asking why I've got so many

663
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
in one day

664
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,380
um because they did all come in at

665
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,480
a very similar time

666
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,640
um and I also was asking for information

667
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,140
on various statistics that should be

668
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,280
published in that so it wasn't anything

669
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,280
that was majorly serious but here are

670
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
some of them

671
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
um essentially there's a ratio there so

672
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,140
the ones that I got and some of the

673
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,120
others so not best friends of the

674
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,679
fishery synapse to be honest

675
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,179
um that's a bit the disappointing one

676
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,760
you can see that one there it's quite

677
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,039
um crazy these are all contracts so they

678
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,720
wouldn't give me the money they wouldn't

679
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
give me the money some

680
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,720
um because their argument is they

681
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
shouldn't be giving out this data before

682
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
it's published

683
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,000
I would disagree with that because it

684
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,380
should be published the minute it's gone

685
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,900
through but they do their own thing uh

686
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,940
the the the home office were pretty

687
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,620
abysmal as well

688
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,539
um these guys were absolutely terrible

689
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,520
this was on actually the build I was

690
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,380
asking about I was asking about who um

691
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,059
voted on the first reading who voted on

692
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,620
the second reading they said that it was

693
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,940
the House of Commons

694
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,799
um which who gave me the information but

695
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,600
I actually wanted the consultation

696
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,880
papers and they wouldn't give me them

697
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,559
um despite the fact they're meant to

698
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,020
have them up before the bills published

699
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,700
um but we won't talk about that

700
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,260
um and then there are my other ones as

701
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,980
well

702
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,419
um that was to do with the salary before

703
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,400
I called Dundee uni out

704
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,360
um they wouldn't give me someone's

705
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,520
salary which is fair enough but again

706
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,960
they should probably have to publish it

707
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,580
and then these were all pieces and

708
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,080
information they didn't have so just to

709
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,580
break these down

710
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,380
um that's kind of you can see the the

711
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,940
chart there you know I've said a good

712
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,100
chunk in the fact that over 25 of those

713
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,380
have been rejected it's pretty abysmal

714
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,380
um and I know my way around FMI laws as

715
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,179
well and I would say most of those that

716
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,679
have been rejected unless they've not

717
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,299
got the information

718
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,159
it's complete rubbish

719
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,260
um and then this is a breakdown here so

720
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,520
the personal information is just that

721
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,340
one there you've got National Security

722
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,640
um they like to throw that one out

723
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,919
um I asked for I can't even remember

724
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,780
what it was I asked for and they just

725
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,480
said National Security I think it might

726
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,100
have been

727
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,559
um

728
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,580
it was this one here so it was the home

729
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,960
office just kind of flowered National

730
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
Security at me and it's like well it's

731
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,460
not quite me asking how many prisoners

732
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,500
there are in the UK is not National

733
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,240
Security

734
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
um it's just them doing what they want

735
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,860
um and then there was confidential

736
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,620
contract information and that they don't

737
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,720
hold the information which is fair

738
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,799
enough if they don't hold it they don't

739
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,059
hold it

740
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:21,960
um

741
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,820
and in a way one of the tricky things

742
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,820
you have is that you've actually got the

743
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,960
issue with the not holding information

744
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,659
that who then is meant to hold it who

745
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,039
then holds it and when you're looking at

746
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,240
government there's all these departments

747
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,280
and they can all hold little bits of not

748
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,299
telling you they're just going to tell

749
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,179
you so conclusion wise things did

750
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,320
improve

751
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,820
um and these are just my opinions the

752
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,440
Freeman infant requests need to be much

753
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
easier to challenge you've got to go

754
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
through a whole internal process and

755
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,179
then you can challenge it in the ICA

756
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,700
but the Ico will only take it if the

757
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,620
whole internal process has been done but

758
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,720
half the time they won't allow you to go

759
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,820
with the internal process so this is

760
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,280
it's fairly tricky to challenge

761
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,200
um they should be regulated

762
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
um they cost a lot of money and I think

763
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,620
that they should have to go through the

764
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,240
Ico for example

765
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,280
um and it's a lot trickier than that but

766
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,960
it's just an idea

767
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
um it needs to be easy to access they

768
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,600
should just have to publish things and

769
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,700
if they don't they should get in trouble

770
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,380
um and the guidance should be easier to

771
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,700
understand and to kind of just leave you

772
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,020
with one little thing

773
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,820
um every time you use and look at the

774
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,440
various acts and get frustrated with

775
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,000
them or you're really happy with them

776
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,860
just think they could be better or they

777
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,360
could be far worse

778
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,039
um and that that's it really if

779
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,419
anybody's got any questions

780
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,740
um and they don't want to ask me now

781
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,120
because I know we're fairly short on

782
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,980
time because we start a little bit late

783
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
um there's my Twitter and there's my

784
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,419
lovely

785
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,580
well-formatted Napier email

786
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,940
um if anybody wants to I mean I'm

787
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,400
discount click so I can't even read that

788
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,679
um but that's probably the best way to

789
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,480
reach me I'm pretty speed on emails but

790
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,679
if you don't want to write down the long

791
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,480
number that's the easiest way to reach

792
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,580
me and if you want the sources there

793
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,919
they are and that's it

794
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,919
foreign
