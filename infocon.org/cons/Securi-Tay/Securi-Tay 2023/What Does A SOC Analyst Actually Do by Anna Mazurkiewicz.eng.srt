1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,320
um so yeah so that's exactly what we're

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
going to be talking about and uh the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,700
story starts that I got stolen from

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,500
Liberty a year ago or I said it to you

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,820
actually answer before and so if you

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,920
kind of stole yourself which is partly

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,199
true as well so and why is this popping

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,539
up there we go there we go so let's get

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,480
started a first of all let's just start

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,660
with the usual disclaimers uh the first

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,159
one would be the obvious and opinions

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,660
that are expressed in the stock are

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,640
exclusive mind they're not on behalf of

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,000
any other company or any other people

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,920
and so this is my own personal

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,660
experience so far

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,940
and the third one is all bargain photos

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,739
have been taken by me and this is not me

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,059
trying to brag this is just basically

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,800
that I'm not a pro photographer so then

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,539
if you are just excuse that because all

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
the photos basically were taken just on

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,640
a quite an old iPhone 10s so they are

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,980
not the best uh but the reason why I've

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,719
Incorporated them is because some of my

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,860
main patches are cyber security

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,899
traveling so I thought I could just uh

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,459
include both of these in this

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,540
presentation

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,040
cool so moving forward what we'll cover

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,260
we'll cover who am I I'm still asking

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,700
myself the same question every single

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,560
day

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,720
uh how I got into security that was

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,180
definitely not a linear path and so I

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,340
think this is the reason why I I really

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,080
want to cover that as well then we're

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,900
just going to do talk about what does a

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,939
soft analysts actually do it on a daily

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,820
basis and we'll just try we'll try

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,500
fingers crossed to do some live demos

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,659
hopefully all the technical issues that

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,400
we experienced in the start they're just

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,060
the last issues of today and then we're

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,200
just going to talk about sometimes

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,460
social change as well because I'm sure

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,159
also bar most of you are actually are

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,360
okay so who am I

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm basically a former Africa hackers

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,560
College business resilience Center I'm

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,979
also a former ethical hacking student

52
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,540
and I finished two years of the degree

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,939
so basically kind of left halfway and

54
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm currently a graduate Apprentice

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,320
security Analyst at Quorum cyber and I'm

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060
also third year cyber security at Napier

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,739
which is actually really good because

58
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,360
that means that I'm studying the whole

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,099
time well I'm also working as a security

60
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,140
analyst in the industry oh full time

61
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,660
it's intense but it's really really good

62
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,239
um then in cyber security I love

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,980
investigating anything that is malicious

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,920
this is good my interests really lie so

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
like might have anything to do with

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,700
anything malicious activity malware

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,319
Ransom throw it if you know me I love

68
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,280
this stuff

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,739
it we're not learning anything security

70
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,500
RIT related I solo travel all of nature

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,959
anything outdoors so I like hiking a lot

72
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,760
and the most recent one is I like

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,580
skydiving and I'm just generally I like

74
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,019
to also be outside of the computer

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,120
because it's important to detach every

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,560
stop because we spend obviously so much

77
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,120
time in in front of the computer

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
and here's my LinkedIn if you ever want

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,420
to connect or if you have any questions

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,300
then you're more than welcome to

81
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,459
um and also Twitter or other really use

82
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,640
it

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,560
cool so moving forward

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
how I go into cyber security so there's

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,780
quite a lot to it uh but let's just

86
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,459
maybe start with the very first one that

87
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,959
I started the lowest possible Computing

88
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,640
course in the college I was a camera

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,940
maybe level four or something and and

90
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,920
then that obviously was not really

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,500
enough to get a job and even in it

92
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,620
related so I remember that I had to

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,260
obviously just live I had to pick up a

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,580
new job and I was out waitress at the

95
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,640
time a waitress bar made and basically I

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,440
absolutely hated the job I absolutely

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
could not stand it and that basically

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,400
was what pushed me to uh do something

99
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,940
with my life at the time and so I

100
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,700
remember taking holidays from work just

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,860
to be able to learn at the time of

102
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,239
sexual web design at lighter got

103
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
Technical and so I remember taking time

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,159
off work just so I can learn some you

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
know obviously HTML as he says

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,580
JavaScript and so on and we're also in

107
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,019
my waitress pads I would just be really

108
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,819
drawing layouts of websites and so on

109
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,040
just so I can Implement that when I'm

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,120
actually

111
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,500
um off work

112
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,900
so thanks to that I got into a web

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,220
development apprenticeship that I

114
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,120
absolutely did not have any

115
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,220
qualifications for but I did have the

116
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,000
portfolio uh so that was actually good

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,160
and then I did I then thought well I

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,540
don't really I feel like I need some

119
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,080
more education so I then did uh agency

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
with open the college and I did not

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,620
enjoy it because I did not really learn

122
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,060
that much

123
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,540
um basically I've felt like the year

124
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,699
that I spent there I could have

125
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,400
um self well I could have been

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
self-studying I would have learned a lot

127
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,320
more so this is what basically made me

128
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,600
um not want to go to UNI at the time and

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm actually really glad because if I

130
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,139
had done my degree in Wendover I would

131
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,580
not be standing here I would not be in

132
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
cyber security and so then I was just

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,419
obviously self-stalling some web

134
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,919
development stuff

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,040
um and I kind of hit the wall and I

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,600
don't know what to do later

137
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,699
um because I kind of got bored with it

138
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,940
uh so I have done in the past also many

139
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,380
retail jobs as well as someone who's

140
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,360
restrictive inclined support and one

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,620
company I was actually there for eight

142
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,240
years and part-time more plus I was

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,320
obviously topping up with some other

144
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,440
party Mark as well and and then uh due

145
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,060
to some circumstances in my life I

146
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,800
basically was like yeah I need to change

147
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,240
and I've been eyeing up the ethical

148
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
hacking degree for quite a while and I

149
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,120
know that cyber security obviously

150
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,979
involves so much

151
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,539
um I'm really curious and I love to

152
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,400
learn and I get bored of stuff easily so

153
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
I thought yes this sounds like

154
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,460
definitely something that I should

155
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,680
giving it a try and I should be going

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,139
into so it was too late to apply for uni

157
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,220
that year

158
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,740
um so I just basically went traveling

159
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,840
for a year and then I went to UNI

160
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
completed two years of the ethical

161
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
hacking degree and I absolutely love

162
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,860
that and now I am I going to Apprentice

163
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,080
as a cyber security analyst I know it's

164
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,340
really amazing I love this stuff

165
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,039
so now uh so Catalyst I personally

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,600
um I don't really use Tick Tock but

167
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,340
someone shared it so I thought this is

168
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,680
actually quite relevant so what we'll

169
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
actually test if the speakers work as

170
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,180
well because God knows uh so sock

171
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,620
analysts what people think when you say

172
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,419
that you are a soccer analyst let's see

173
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,639
if that works let me actually put up the

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,120
volume I think it's actually there we go

175
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,800
let's see if that works

176
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
is it gonna work

177
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,800
it's the last Zone

178
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,340
yes it's not working

179
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,080
but let's see

180
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,600
it's not a phone think of this there we

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
go that is working now

182
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,919
but yes basically the sound does not

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
come through for some reason basically

184
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,940
it's a guy saying yeah this is the socks

185
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,860
you know you need you this is the

186
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,620
running socks this is the socks with it

187
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,120
um

188
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,220
yeah that kind of sock unless it's not

189
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,319
very descriptive right

190
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
um so this obviously before I started

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,539
the job I had absolute no idea uh what a

192
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,100
saw panelist is obviously I got a new

193
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,259
year security operations center is you

194
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,880
know where you probably have some super

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,100
trailers and stuff like that but I

196
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,020
wasn't too sure what that is

197
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,120
um

198
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,960
so let's move forward

199
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
so now here we're just going to be

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,919
talking about now for real okay so what

201
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,220
is if what even is the salt so

202
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,020
um sock is stands for Security operation

203
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,699
Center as probably a lot of you will

204
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,400
know and uh basically what we're doing

205
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
is of course we are monitoring detecting

206
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,660
we're investigating preventing various

207
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,660
cyber tests 24 hours seven days a week

208
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,580
um we are using for that we are

209
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,919
basically using a Sim I'm sure that

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,800
again a lot of you have heard that in

211
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
before so it's security information and

212
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,759
even management so we it's it's

213
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,099
basically a software solution that is

214
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,740
collecting all the security data from a

215
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,539
network devices servers domain controls

216
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,520
this one and it provides a real time

217
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
analysis of security analysis generated

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
by applications and network Hardware so

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,660
we basically have it all in one place uh

220
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,259
centralized

221
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,220
and this is just like a little graphic

222
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,139
that of course just shows us a few

223
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,240
elements of assault so for example we

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,099
actually talked about the same we have

225
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,900
also 50 things so each alert comes

226
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,660
through an essay kit and you have to

227
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,580
know which basically though prepondering

228
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
log collection

229
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,020
foreign

230
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,080
looking at job offers across a few

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,120
popular job boards we will not have time

232
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,860
to cover everything but as you can see

233
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,899
you know there's things that are common

234
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,020
with all of these uh but some of these

235
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,339
are

236
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,899
um a little bit different so the scope

237
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,120
really matter it differs from company to

238
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,300
company uh so as you can see you know a

239
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,220
lot is expected and a lot again it

240
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,260
varies from company to company but

241
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,399
here's my experience

242
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,779
so what does a sock and let's do for my

243
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,360
personal experience and first of all

244
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,660
when you typically when you start a a

245
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,700
quorum you will be returning fishing

246
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,240
emails apart and this is very fun and so

247
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,740
we'll cover that briefly we'll not have

248
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,480
time for demo or that but we'll just

249
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
cover the steps shortly the main part of

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
course is security alerts and that will

251
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
just have a little brief demo of that as

252
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
well and then customer communication is

253
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
a small part of the job that you'll do

254
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,260
it so whenever you get alert and you

255
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,760
know you have to handle it somehow so

256
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,260
it's either going to be benign or you

257
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,880
have to present to the customer you have

258
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,220
to scale it to IR which is antenna's

259
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,800
response and and of course when the

260
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
customer comes back to us someone has to

261
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
deal with it or if the customer has any

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,260
questions as well again someone has to

263
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,600
deal with it so and you would just be

264
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,339
basically handling the customers

265
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,279
questions maybe they want the anal you

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
know maybe they want they have some

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,519
questions in general to

268
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,040
for the investigation and so on so

269
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,120
that's basically the customer

270
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,080
communication here

271
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,160
so now we're just going to talk about

272
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
phishing email analysis and just a few

273
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,320
steps so first of all you would analyze

274
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,320
the subject line content State and time

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
of the email sent

276
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,339
um you would obviously be looking hey is

277
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,980
this a bit not weird and you know for

278
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,959
example when it comes to the time it has

279
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,100
been sent

280
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,080
like it looks like for example from your

281
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,060
time zone but it's one or two am and so

282
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,700
on that's a bit bizarre then you would

283
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,320
also check email address and various

284
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,300
awesome tools

285
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,740
you would then check email address

286
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,360
domain

287
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
a and are there any attachments and the

288
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,640
URLs if there are then yes analyze them

289
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,700
in a sandbox environment

290
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,320
and of course double check the content

291
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,180
for any additional information like

292
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,220
phone numbers and any other relevant

293
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,040
data that might be there

294
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,500
so we are going to have

295
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,760
a couple of examples

296
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,360
I don't know if you're able to see this

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
I'll probably zoom in because I know how

298
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,500
ironing is when they're at the at any

299
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,540
talk that is very especially here on the

300
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,800
back you just can't see anything so

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,660
let's zoom in

302
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,940
um

303
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,980
you will see that better yes I think all

304
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,680
good I think better Okay cool so this is

305
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
just an example of uh of an email from

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
Deborah

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,040
um as you can see the subject is NatWest

308
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,680
mortgage offer and it comes from LMS

309
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,440
that's strange but dear sir or Madame

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,380
well that's a very generic greeting and

311
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,300
obviously just have some stuff here and

312
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,640
we have a couple of links but it just

313
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,740
generally looks really weird uh because

314
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,300
of the subject and the from it's Deborah

315
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,100
that company which doesn't have anything

316
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,500
to do with mortgage NatWest mortgage

317
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,279
offer and the links again are that's

318
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,779
basically the links we restricted from

319
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,600
that so it's

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
it's a secure Mullins Tracy whatever

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,279
that is a it's basically just your

322
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,279
typical fishing link

323
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,140
again you would just go and obviously

324
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,899
have a check with that um

325
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,320
now this is an interesting one uh this

326
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,000
is

327
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,940
and you move from apparently for PayPal

328
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
from Berlin Department of people

329
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
apparently

330
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,300
um missing you an invoice of 600 pounds

331
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,339
and and then we have seller notes

332
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,320
according to information your PayPal

333
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,940
account might have been illegally

334
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,240
accessed so and they obviously give you

335
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,860
the phone number and they tell you they

336
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,720
all business opening hours there's a

337
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,980
very important part here that you know

338
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,480
don't know the seller you can safely

339
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,100
ignore this invoice if you're not buying

340
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,620
anything from the seller but quite a few

341
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,240
people would be just led to believe yeah

342
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,800
this is legitimate right because it

343
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
comes from PayPal

344
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,760
um and it it just has the phone number

345
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,500
some people would just place a call and

346
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,300
they would get social engineered to pay

347
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,360
and and that's the thing I don't call

348
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,740
like a callback scam or something like

349
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,079
that so yeah

350
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,480
oops there we go

351
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,600
and the links also are pretty much all

352
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,820
paper related so nothing interesting

353
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,459
there but it's it's in the body of the

354
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,880
of the email

355
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,320
now moving forward to Microsoft Central

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
so it's one of the tools that we use is

357
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,899
basically collect what does it collects

358
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,820
all the data from various sources

359
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,040
including like users applications

360
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,579
servers and so on and it just basically

361
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,339
some premises or in the cloud it

362
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,740
includes obviously built-in connectors

363
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,019
for easy onboarding of various popular

364
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,399
devices and log analytics and it's a

365
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,860
tool in Azure that where we just

366
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,920
basically edit and run log queries and

367
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
from data collected within the Azure

368
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,839
monitor logs and and we're doing that

369
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,300
using ql which is Crystal query language

370
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,160
and it's a very powerful tool to

371
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,779
basically explore that data and pull out

372
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,720
things that we need from logs and and

373
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,300
that obviously helps us then to identify

374
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,940
various patterns any anomalies and so on

375
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,279
and kickable is kind of similar to SQL

376
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,920
but actually it's a lot easier

377
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,000
Earth can be

378
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,260
Okay so

379
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,240
we also have we will not have time to go

380
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,459
over this but we also have Microsoft 365

381
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,579
Defender threat protection and that is

382
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,260
just like a defense suit that again

383
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,940
coordinates detection prevention

384
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,680
investigation and those concept of

385
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,680
endpoints and there's a lot to it

386
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,600
there's four parts of it main parts of

387
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,720
it and and it allows you to do a lot

388
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,240
more and one of the cool things for

389
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
example is if you have a

390
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,339
you're able to see for example the

391
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,779
device timeline you're able to see

392
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,160
everything that's been happening on the

393
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,959
device that has been onboarded and it's

394
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,339
just a really really cool to let you

395
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,160
will not have time to cover that but

396
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
it's just an article that we obviously

397
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,500
use

398
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,540
so

399
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
security alerts demo time there we go so

400
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
uh latest imagine the scenario and that

401
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,839
okay so the Azure the The Sentinel logs

402
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,000
the demo logs are unfortunately a little

403
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,040
bit limited so we'll not be able to do

404
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,279
it exactly from scratch however if we do

405
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,779
assume um

406
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,760
just the scenario that well we received

407
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,860
an alert for a malicious IP address

408
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,779
and let's investigate it so we'll just

409
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,480
be doing some log analytics with kql and

410
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,100
within Sentinel we'll also do some

411
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
awesome checks and and let's see if that

412
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,540
works let's let's hope it does

413
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,380
see what has it done this

414
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,000
right I'll just grab the link I'll just

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,100
run it

416
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,220
thank you

417
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,260
how's it going there perfect

418
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
strange it's not too strong maybe this

419
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,820
is an end let's see

420
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,920
probably better

421
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
yes there we go

422
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,959
um cool so basically that's our old

423
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,839
Sentinel logs and that's where we just

424
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
uh searching for the things that we need

425
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,519
to search for okay we have if we expand

426
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,680
this part and we can't see for some

427
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,859
reason

428
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
I don't know it's still doing that but

429
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,980
anyway there's a part where you can just

430
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,899
expand and see all the tables that are

431
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,639
available I'm not sure it's not showing

432
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,440
up oh it's basically

433
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,180
here you'll be able Okay click here

434
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,560
you'll be able to see all the tables

435
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,180
that are available but it's not a big

436
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,579
deal what we can do what we will be

437
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,220
doing we'll be looking for the IP

438
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,320
address

439
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,779
so just to go back

440
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,500
where is this

441
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,339
oops

442
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,480
closer there we go

443
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:10,188
[Music]

444
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,020
so let me just quickly

445
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,160
um

446
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,559
grab the IP address that we are going to

447
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,939
investigate

448
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,679
and have a look where the iPad is

449
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,640
actually is in the logs

450
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,559
okay

451
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,039
so if we want to search it's probably if

452
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,299
you

453
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,179
um ever get to do in log analytics and

454
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,860
Sentinel is probably the number one

455
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,320
career that you want to know is just

456
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,059
searching for something and

457
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,460
summarizing it by table so basically you

458
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,039
search for an entity the a URL be a

459
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,980
username and again a computer name you

460
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,140
know hosting and so on and you're just

461
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,539
you just basically will have it will

462
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,600
input it will output the tables where

463
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,160
that entity is that you're searching for

464
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,500
so in that case

465
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,179
we would be search

466
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,799
sunrise

467
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,918
let me just go back

468
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,960
sunrise by table

469
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,820
that's right

470
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,700
yeah okay thanks uh and we'll just run

471
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,580
it let's see where

472
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
actually there's one more thing because

473
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,860
I didn't change the time so we also can

474
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,440
select the time range and how far back

475
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,059
we want to be able to see where it

476
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,500
entity is

477
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,140
let's just do a month simple

478
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
and let's run that

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
so uh the IP address the demolition here

480
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,059
addressing and

481
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,340
the all these tables

482
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,100
uh and the vehicle actually is azure

483
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,780
Diagnostics and her network analytics

484
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,120
and so on the one that well we've been

485
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,799
investigate all of them but just for the

486
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,179
purpose of this demo we'll just have a

487
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,900
look at VM connection

488
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,679
so and

489
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,220
so what we do we just put the name of

490
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,980
the table of VM collection

491
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,660
and we're just searching again because

492
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,320
we are not sure where oh

493
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
which column the IPR this is going

494
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,159
inside that's fine

495
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,320
oh thank you see I didn't see that

496
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,380
because it turned huh at the end thank

497
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,559
you

498
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,140
cool so we've got one log uh which

499
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,660
actually has that

500
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,320
IP address

501
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,100
um

502
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,720
and

503
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,520
we could expand it and we can see where

504
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,200
that is we could also see the name of

505
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
the host

506
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,919
um and all the information here but the

507
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,900
thing that we can do now is we can

508
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,700
let's see

509
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,980
what I'm going to do

510
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,559
I'm going to duplicate screen I've just

511
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,500
realized that will be a lot easier so

512
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,380
uh we can do we can start in our awesome

513
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,960
checks on the IP address so first of all

514
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,780
what we do is we would have a look at IP

515
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,400
info and we'll just check the IP address

516
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,360
so again apn4 is quite uh

517
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
self-explanatory what it does that it

518
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
shows us the ASN and shows us the G

519
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,840
location and you know the range of the

520
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
IP address and so on so

521
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
um so yeah so we can see that this is a

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,799
Chinese IP address I can see the

523
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,080
geolocation the next thing that we would

524
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,120
check we would

525
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,799
check it in virus total

526
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,419
and again it's a really good tool to

527
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,039
just check

528
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,020
um you can check whoever else there as

529
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,940
well there's appear this is a domains

530
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,960
one

531
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,179
and see if there's been any if it's been

532
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,039
reported through malicious according to

533
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,260
various security vendors so in this case

534
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,679
yes it has been uh flat as malicious by

535
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,580
a six six security vendors and

536
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,100
uh yes so it's basically we can also see

537
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,320
here that it's been marked for malware

538
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,900
and just being malicious we can also

539
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,580
explore the tabs although I don't think

540
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,200
there's anything interesting here my

541
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,179
virus total is a cool tool

542
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,400
um just have a look at every stuff this

543
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,520
community

544
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,600
um so the AP was carrying out the

545
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,840
sagebrid Sports on 28th of September

546
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,700
okay and

547
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,440
probably not that relevant now maybe

548
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,299
because we could have been recycled

549
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,400
since but it's still you know all this

550
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
information that is available to you

551
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,700
another

552
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,200
on the awesome tool that we can actually

553
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,679
look at is use a pdb has it been

554
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,240
reported for any malicious activity

555
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,000
before and yes actually the confidence

556
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
of abuse is 100 it was found in our

557
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,260
database and you can actually see all

558
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,059
the reports here

559
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,220
um as well as when it actually was

560
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,900
recorded

561
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,059
and another two there's another couple

562
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,200
of tools that we're just going to go

563
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,080
over is risk back here

564
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,039
when it loads

565
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,400
it's not loading just now but let's see

566
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,580
Cisco italics intelligence too and again

567
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,440
we can look up the maze you can look up

568
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,780
IP addresses here first I could actually

569
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,200
load this so let's talk about this

570
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
and they just see what risk IQ tells us

571
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,840
about this AP address

572
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,640
so far it has neutral score but let's

573
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,360
see

574
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,100
but as we can see that it's been blocked

575
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,520
by third party and that's actually it

576
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
tells us why

577
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,480
so it tells us the indicator of possible

578
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,580
malicious intent and threads Flags

579
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,960
demanding control and just gives us all

580
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,760
this information also tells us all the

581
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,120
other things that not or no no import

582
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
detected not proxy it's also web server

583
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,900
apparently as well

584
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,120
so the last check that we are going to

585
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,559
do

586
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,980
is Cisco Palace and it actually

587
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,080
gives it it basically tells us that

588
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,120
sender IP reputation is poor but web

589
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,860
reputation is unknown

590
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,960
and it's not been added to any block

591
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
class and yeah it just gives us a bunch

592
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,100
of information here but that's all we

593
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,200
need for now

594
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,620
so another thing that we can also do

595
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,440
um let's see here

596
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,720
we also have our hostname just going

597
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,820
back to the blogs

598
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,840
what we can do

599
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,580
we can

600
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,380
do the same thing like you did before so

601
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,200
we can search for the host and we can

602
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,260
also summarize it

603
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,600
like table and let's see where that host

604
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,899
is

605
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,820
and we can see all these tables where

606
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,840
the

607
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,059
computer actually is so what we would

608
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,679
want to do in this case would probably

609
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,840
just go through at least some of the

610
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,159
relevant ones again we'll not have

611
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,220
obviously the time but um the host is in

612
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,760
many many tables

613
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,780
so

614
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,780
let me just extend that so we can just

615
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,419
let's go back to the slide and slide go

616
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,580
I've gone through that so just to

617
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,340
summarize as well uh the tools the

618
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,200
awesome tools that we have used is IP

619
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,679
info we've used virus Toto with appears

620
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,559
at pdb we use risk IQ and we've used

621
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,720
this Cisco cells intelligence and some

622
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,280
artwork that we would use for the

623
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
previous phishing emails that we didn't

624
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,440
have time to actually have a look at it

625
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,480
was URL scan for example if you just

626
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,020
want to run an Europe any domains or any

627
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,120
any malicious domains and you'll be able

628
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,799
to get like a screenshot of it there and

629
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,539
you'll be able to see the classification

630
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:16,980
a lot more

631
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,960
um information about as well and email

632
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,059
right password and API void email

633
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,220
repetition check to check the reputation

634
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,299
of the email

635
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,900
so that's again what is explanatory

636
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,960
and moving on to the last but not least

637
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
uh tips for students

638
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,700
if there's one number one thing that I

639
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,640
would always say to anyone is scary is

640
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
good go to scary and the scary things

641
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,919
are typically the things that you learn

642
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,200
the most from and getting out of your

643
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
comfort zone is again ask questions with

644
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,940
my sound and it's again that's how you

645
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,700
grow the most so always just do things

646
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,539
that you know you terrify you

647
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,880
and so it's it's just really good for

648
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,260
your self-development and for your

649
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,120
confidence in the long run and just for

650
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,980
learning a lot

651
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,500
and be proactive and again in any sort

652
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,600
of way and you know in any aspect of

653
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
your life I just especially when job

654
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,100
hunting don't be afraid to reach out to

655
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,679
any potential employers even if they

656
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,779
don't have any jobs advertised you know

657
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,720
just always be proactive not just uh sit

658
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,340
there and wait for things being done for

659
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,100
you just always go out there and yeah

660
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,840
that's basically another advice I would

661
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,419
give a soft skills matter such as again

662
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,520
you know communication skills confidence

663
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,120
and enthusiasm positivity and uh

664
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,580
engaging with others as well a of course

665
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,080
effective communication is super

666
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,380
important because you want to be able to

667
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,440
articulate technical Concepts to a lot

668
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,380
of people you know to non-technical

669
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,440
stakeholders to less technical clients

670
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,799
and and colleagues as well sometimes so

671
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,960
clear communication just basically helps

672
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,840
to improving confusion right and it

673
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,539
reduces risks as well as it increases

674
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,539
security and the and overall

675
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,100
another thing as well is attention

676
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,500
digital is crucial so again it's

677
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,840
essential because

678
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,380
um

679
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,539
you'll need to be very careful and pay

680
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,460
attention to the details because even

681
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,279
the smallest uh mistake can lead to a

682
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,440
significant data breach so attention

683
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,720
detail is is definitely very important

684
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,820
here as well as writing skills again you

685
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,080
want to be able to communicate your

686
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,740
technical findings uh to a wide range of

687
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,760
people

688
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,340
and if if your writing skills are not

689
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,620
really that good then again it doesn't

690
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,380
come as across as professional

691
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,120
um and again if if you know there's some

692
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,620
sort of condition of course that you

693
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,059
know I do understand that people have a

694
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,740
rating but um I'm sure there are some

695
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,480
tools as well that can help uh so

696
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
writing skills really do matter uh as

697
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,260
much as I know it might sound quite

698
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,659
boring but they are really important uh

699
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,020
in many many cyber security jobs

700
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,659
and conferences events uh this generally

701
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,460
build your network

702
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,580
um there's really a found myself that

703
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,500
people on cyber security a lot of them

704
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,240
are just really supportive and I've

705
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,380
found great friends even though I've

706
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,059
been in the industry for less than a

707
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,880
year and and really just all those

708
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,440
events conferences and people that you

709
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,240
meet they would just be a really great

710
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,320
support network for you

711
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,000
about having said that as well of course

712
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,340
also take breaks and detach to restock

713
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,320
and because professional burnout is

714
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,500
really is very real okay so it is

715
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,360
important to

716
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,039
um just have something

717
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,179
um that is

718
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,159
not involving cyber security where you

719
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,799
can just go and rest up and completely

720
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
detach from all this stuff I found the

721
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,539
brakes really do help uh both with

722
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,400
studying both of work and with

723
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,600
everything we all need breaks

724
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,140
yo I'm not sure but have we got thank

725
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,400
our questions

726
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Junction

727
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,440
that's fine so I guess we still have we

728
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
have time for maybe one question a very

729
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,779
short one yeah

730
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,580
and I think the most it's a difficult

731
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,440
question it's a good one but there's so

732
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,020
many things I

733
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,000
I think that I need to learn so much and

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,159
of course you know really really good

735
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,659
people that I'm surrounded with and

736
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,720
that's the two of the biggest things and

737
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
I really enjoy and it's just always

738
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
exciting you know every single day looks

739
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,320
different it's it's never the same so

740
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,179
that's another part as well I really

741
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,720
really enjoy

742
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,850
[Music]

743
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,959
