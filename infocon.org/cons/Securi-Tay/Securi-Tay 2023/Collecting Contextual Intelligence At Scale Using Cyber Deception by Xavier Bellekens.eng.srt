1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,640
your Falcons

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,340
right folks like a very

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,940
um

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,179
intimate session then

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,839
so I'm Xavier and I'll be talking a bit

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,900
about deception and mostly putting it at

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,000
scale so who am I as I said Xavier uh

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
most importantly I love data and I think

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,060
the rest of it I'll let you read in your

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,260
own time

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,739
but today I'll talk about like some uh

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,280
current defense strategies uh I'll talk

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,160
about using deception as a strategy

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,180
um why it gather Telemetry and I'll talk

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,180
a bit about honeypots and deception uh

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,940
building uh building a decoy and then

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,020
we'll go into setting up cheap deception

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,079
um and honeypots and decoys the use

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
cases that you may want to to go through

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,879
uh figuring out what to do with the data

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,739
because quite often we see like

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
honeypots being put up and then we see

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,640
the same type of analysis all the time

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,159
like a password Cloud that's not the

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,500
most useful then all you obtain

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,100
intelligence out of all of that data I'm

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,740
then toying with some of our Russian

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,119
frames and how you use that data

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,200
so questions that I wanted to uh try to

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
answer uh essentially is someone

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,060
targeting your sector specifically so

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,979
they happen to be like I don't know in

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
oil and gas is someone targeting the oil

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,439
and gas sector and what are they doing

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,020
right now so not the type of threat

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,600
Intel feed that you usually get you may

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,880
want to know in real time if the target

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,399
the oil and gas sector uh what are they

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,079
doing how are they doing it those type

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,140
of questions and is someone targeting

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,799
your organization right now and for a

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,780
long have they been doing it and what

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,060
are they doing so a couple of couple of

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,460
questions an answer that you can

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,799
probably answer using deception so if we

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,000
kind of look at our current defenses

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,340
we've been building walls and the idea

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,780
of building walls is like we put

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,520
intrusion detection systems we put

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,580
firewalls cdrs xdr ndr all of those

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,120
great stuff right and we use that

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,300
as technically passive defenses and the

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,440
main idea

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,599
we reduce the probability or minimize

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,720
the attack surface that's all we do and

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,239
we hope that at some point nobody goes

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,239
over the wall uh nobody

58
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,260
it's inside as a citrator

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,840
and or it's an Insider threat and open

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,060
the gates right so that's the always the

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,300
the issues with current defenses and so

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,180
far it's working quite well right we

63
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,760
just see a couple of cyber attacks every

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,959
day

65
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,060
um and they're still successful despite

66
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,640
all of the technology that that we've

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,580
been using and it's not only like

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,560
smaller businesses that are being

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
targeted uh as the critical national

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,540
infrastructures uh and we go like from

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,940
ex-employee that shut down Kansas water

72
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,420
system uh to uh other stuff that are a

73
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,659
bit more cool like Russians infiltrating

74
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,540
um space launch systems right so there's

75
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,000
a couple of things in there where you

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,159
wonder how is this possible we've got

77
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,560
like EDR we've got xdr we've got ndr

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,200
we've got all of those stuff around and

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,800
yet we are still uh losing

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,780
and losing is like I think I think

81
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,920
xenophomism in in this case right so

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
I'd like to talk strategy right and the

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,000
first thing that comes to my mind when I

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
talk about about strategies like mostly

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,540
game strategy and when you think about a

86
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,459
strategy you think about like what the

87
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,340
adversary is doing and you never become

88
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,739
a good strategist unless

89
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,959
he applies strategy yourself so you've

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,900
got to go nobody wins a war on the first

91
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,599
try right it doesn't happen that's why

92
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,120
there's like governments pulling War

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
historians and trying to understand why

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,279
someone went left why someone went right

95
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,220
why someone crossed the river at a

96
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,280
certain point in time right and it all

97
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,180
depends of a lot of data that is being

98
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,040
pulled and based on that information

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
people go like all right this is what we

100
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,580
think we should do and this is why we've

101
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,040
got the best probability of winning a

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,560
tour right and if you're like if you

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
like like movies like sport movies from

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,800
the 80s and 90s usually you see like

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,620
someone like putting a tape in a tape

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,900
recorder and going like looking at the

107
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,940
teams how the team is playing and Sport

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,479
and essentially what we are missing at

109
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
the moment is like data about or

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,900
opponent Style of playing and preparing

111
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
for game day and at the moment we've got

112
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,960
quite a variety of opponents and they

113
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,259
play a variety of games right so you go

114
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,240
like from your your script kitty playing

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,180
one type of game uh to your nation

116
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
Street nation states straight actor or

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,759
your apt check actor playing another

118
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,919
type of game it's quite difficult if you

119
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,979
think about it to gather data first of

120
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,340
all about all of them but also to

121
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,199
understand the techniques that they are

122
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,660
using for a long they are using those

123
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,520
techniques all those techniques are

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,280
evolving and once you've got those

125
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
techniques you still need to analyze

126
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,120
them and figuring out

127
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,720
oh well in that particular scenario they

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,120
are using that type of technique

129
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,780
to get to that fly right and it might

130
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,199
differ by sector might differ based on

131
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,600
like the type of organization they are

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
targeting or it might not differ at all

133
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,180
right like at the moment we don't have

134
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,340
the data so

135
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,560
all possibilities are technically open

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,860
in the air so the first thing that we

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,960
usually do as we look at like our

138
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,020
beautiful pyramid and we go like which

139
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,020
threat actor are we kind of looking at

140
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,319
right are we looking at like our tier

141
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,319
one attackers Crypt KD uh and and their

142
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,060
game plan what what are those guys doing

143
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,740
what's their what's their game plan is

144
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,479
it like simply

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,780
you know just like scanning and using

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,180
tools or are you looking at like our

147
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,180
criminal groups and how are they

148
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,740
taking like attacks forwards and so if

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,860
we start concentrating on the traductors

150
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,979
right and we start looking at them I'm

151
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,780
trying to understand

152
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,020
how they operate and what they want from

153
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,720
us we start seeing a couple of folks

154
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,100
like emerging in a lot of cases and the

155
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,259
first one is like our Mass scanner

156
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,960
adversary like which are script junkies

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,759
they'll just make scripts and everybody

158
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,400
seem to use the same scripts and

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,180
essentially they just mask can based on

160
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,039
what's Happening and they look for

161
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,599
vulnerabilities that they can exploit

162
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,419
and then based on that or the group that

163
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,639
they are they will maybe run around

164
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,220
somewhere or do some other operation you

165
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,319
get like your opportunistic adversary

166
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,120
and like I like to divide those ones

167
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,860
because the opportunity opportunistic

168
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,259
adversary might not always be there

169
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,819
right

170
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,360
VMware es6i like a couple of weeks ago

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,919
being exploited

172
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,740
some people joined in right like you

173
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,199
have your mass scanner like a group that

174
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,599
goes in Muskan but then at some point

175
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,099
you start seeing more and more folks

176
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,099
joining in and like jumping on dot that

177
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,440
particular opportunity and then you get

178
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,199
like your uh activist adversary and

179
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,599
these ones are quite cool they just are

180
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,960
ephemeral they come in swoop in and then

181
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,639
they disappear and they might only come

182
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,259
in for a single operation

183
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,419
you might never see them again it's like

184
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,880
someone that's at home like maybe part

185
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,300
of an anonymous maybe part of nothing

186
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,500
but they are just there for a cause and

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,199
they decide to just come carrying on

188
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,199
carrying out an attack either alone or

189
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,219
in a group

190
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,679
make some damage find the knees up here

191
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,559
but all of those have some commonalities

192
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,559
like they use the same script some of

193
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
them share them across forums and like

194
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,560
other places they use the same CVS they

195
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,839
show up at your doorstep and want it so

196
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,700
they're like the three of them just show

197
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,580
up and you never want them they use same

198
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,779
ttps

199
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,120
and they're responsible for most of the

200
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
confirmation and their ID is like quite

201
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,279
often to conquer the world and and they

202
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,720
look like either like if you're a French

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,360
Ministry cortex or I can't remember the

204
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,459
name in English like care of that boy

205
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,760
who has the name as pink in the brain is

206
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
the brain right but in fact most of the

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,700
time those guys they're not the smartest

208
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
they're they're just using the

209
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
technology that's out there they are not

210
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,440
making anything that is brand new

211
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
they're just reusing but they still do

212
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,279
90 of the of the attacks out there so

213
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,440
how do we learn about that about them

214
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,760
essentially

215
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
and place honeypots so I got a grief

216
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,880
against Tony pots right so I'll go into

217
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,279
that and

218
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,200
he made her believe that I'm a

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,660
like someone at Tesla that's sent me a

220
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,820
nice email called nice LinkedIn message

221
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,140
I won it live right but essentially

222
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,880
a Honeypot

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,580
as if you ask someone what Honeypot is

224
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,160
it's like a service that you've put out

225
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,459
there and that is gathering data so I

226
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,260
basically copied what I what I posted on

227
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,399
LinkedIn right

228
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,380
in reality

229
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,540
that's true

230
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,600
but the moment you start tweaking it to

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
make it more

232
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,060
appealable is that a word appealable

233
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,100
appealable is not a word but if you try

234
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,560
to appeal people right with your

235
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,480
Honeypot and you start making tweaks you

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,880
start entering the field of deception so

237
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,800
in my opinion a Honeypot is something

238
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,839
that you just download like teapot you

239
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
place it out there that's a Honeypot

240
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
ninety percent of the data or 99 of the

241
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,779
data that you're gonna gather is a

242
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,240
password Cloud that's great but not

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,760
fantastic you're not gonna make use of

244
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,980
all of that information you're gonna get

245
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,899
like usernames you're not gonna make use

246
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,060
of that that information but the moment

247
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,920
you start tweaking it and tweaking it

248
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,540
against that Versa you start getting

249
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,240
like information that becomes slightly

250
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,880
more interesting so

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,540
in my opinion honeypots are a subset of

252
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,420
deception right and that's important

253
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,700
because the moment you start tweaking to

254
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,800
an adversary and obviously we want to

255
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,560
appeal to all of the adversaries right

256
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,860
you then enter the realm of deception

257
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,480
and deception

258
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
it's about Gathering the right Telemetry

259
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,839
at the right time but making it

260
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,500
um repeatable so essentially you're able

261
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,660
to gather information about multiple

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,079
traductors in a repeatable way so

263
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,600
deceiving consistently obviously I've

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,000
got a bit more to that to that deception

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,339
story right but that's basically the the

266
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,940
academic definition that I will abide to

267
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,320
right

268
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,820
and so

269
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,279
using deception

270
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,220
you get adversaries to come to use so

271
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,240
you don't have to go and Chase

272
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
adversaries right you don't have to find

273
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,060
them you can let them come to you

274
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,880
because same Principle as a honeybot

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,060
right anything that touches it

276
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,240
is considered malicious now you've

277
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
tweaked it

278
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,480
and you've tweaked your Honeypot or your

279
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
dick or your view build your decoy and

280
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,579
essentially when it gets compromised

281
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,519
your adversary has only one goal in mind

282
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,339
as the flag right and so they get like

283
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,920
that kind of tunnel vision they are

284
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,620
aimed at the flag they know that stuff

285
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,019
are there right so they know this stuff

286
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,240
on the side but they are not able to see

287
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
it yet right which is great for our

288
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,180
analogy essentially you get like the

289
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,100
idea of a flat right

290
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,120
and if you're a burglar and suddenly you

291
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,339
break a window of the flat and you enter

292
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,800
in bedroom two what's gonna happen

293
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,480
you're gonna know there's gonna be a

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,339
kitchen you're gonna know there's gonna

295
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,560
be a bathroom maybe another bedroom

296
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,500
maybe a TV right so you are expecting

297
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,680
things right regardless of your

298
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,000
knowledge

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,160
whether you're an advanced adversary

300
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,680
which has knowledge of the system right

301
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,240
there's always going to be something

302
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,579
that is unexpected but it's also

303
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:15,180
something that's going to be expected

304
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,600
using deception you can start playing on

305
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
these

306
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,540
um

307
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,839
on these biases essentially and shape

308
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,540
the vision of an adversary you are going

309
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,940
to be able to provide some information

310
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,220
like a certain key that opens a certain

311
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,519
door and you're going to be able to do

312
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,019
that consistently to shape the way they

313
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,660
see your flood whether it's true or not

314
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,660
right it doesn't matter because remember

315
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,940
they are focused on the goal and the

316
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,220
goal in this case might be to steal your

317
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,980
TV as soon as possible or as fast as

318
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,019
possible so if you start giving them

319
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,500
keys that open certain doors going to a

320
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,320
living room at getting effect TV it's

321
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,060
still the goal they are still feeling

322
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,040
that they are progressing but you've

323
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
shaped their vision and you've let them

324
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,760
go from one place to another

325
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
now the way you do that with deception

326
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,279
is by creating essentially

327
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,639
a story so you create a plot right for

328
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,279
your adversary and not every adversary

329
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,920
is the same so suddenly you need to

330
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,380
start making deception appealing to the

331
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,820
type of adversary that you're looking

332
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,700
like right that you that you want

333
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,200
interacting with your own organization

334
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,540
so you might way you might create a

335
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,139
chronology of events right and for that

336
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,959
you tweak your decoys to contain very

337
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,420
specific type of data and the data is

338
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,399
tweaked based on the adversary like for

339
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,440
example if you have a script Kitty the

340
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,060
chances of them looking into memory

341
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,459
might be very low right but they might

342
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,560
open a file so you start making like

343
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,260
chronology decisions over your decoys

344
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,300
you start like making placing like

345
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
different types of files using different

346
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,139
type of characters that may like

347
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,060
programmatically interact with those

348
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,940
files you might put allies and opponents

349
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,139
based on what's Happening you could

350
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,240
simulate another threat actor currently

351
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
on the decoy you can simulate a lot of

352
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,440
information that will

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,800
essentially influence your traductor

354
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,500
and based off this information the

355
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,180
threat actor is going to either go left

356
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,940
right continuous

357
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,720
continue this track or stop there right

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
now

359
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,760
in order to build a Decoy for the right

360
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,199
trade actor right we use ourselves like

361
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,680
this model so it's basically derived out

362
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,380
of some sociology uh course with like

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,019
routine activity Theory and the idea is

364
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,639
that in order for a crime to be

365
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,440
committed you need to have an offender

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,199
and that we have you need to have like

367
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,480
an absence of guardian and so the

368
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,940
guardian is essentially in a network it

369
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,139
assume that like if they've not been

370
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,139
detected by the EDR they've not been

371
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,519
detected by anything else right there's

372
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,800
an absence of guardian and then a Target

373
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,839
and the target needs to essentially

374
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,180
appeal to them in credibility you need

375
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,040
to get something out of it so you want

376
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
to gather some Telemetry you want to

377
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
understand what they are doing how they

378
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,199
are doing it all of those kind of things

379
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,199
like are they opening certain files are

380
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,060
they looking for something that is of

381
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,699
value right so for example you get

382
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,120
someone touching like a database of your

383
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,880
clients right you want to know are they

384
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,260
actually looking for a very specific

385
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,820
client that would be an interesting

386
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,860
information or are they just dumping the

387
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,079
entire database right and the new ones

388
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
on dynamicity and the idea of dynamicity

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
is essentially to get

390
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,720
them to believe that what they're on is

391
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
actually a system being used it makes it

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,680
more interesting if like there's no

393
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,019
dynamicity as an adversary you may think

394
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,820
well actually I might be on a Honeypot

395
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,920
or in a system that's not being in use

396
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,800
and I might not get further closer or

397
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,199
closer to my flag right so you can use

398
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,720
like this type of like models to start

399
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,559
building a decoy that fits your target

400
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,660
audience essentially it's a bit like

401
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,240
marketing right like

402
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,359
you adapt it to whoever you want to buy

403
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,939
your product in this case you adapt it

404
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,980
to the adversary that you want to

405
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,079
attract towards you

406
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,780
and So based on that you can start like

407
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
for example making a fake wind turbine

408
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,740
and in effect wind turbine you would

409
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,980
have like plc's for the gearbox and plcs

410
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,500
for a soft starter and anybody that is

411
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,539
not familiar with like a wind turbine

412
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,960
would be like oh that's great I can

413
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,059
interact with a wind turbine now if you

414
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,460
start like looking at someone that is

415
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,559
familiar with the wind turbine

416
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,140
you get slightly more components and

417
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,880
they might realize that they are

418
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,120
actually not on a real wind turbine so

419
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,620
you'd need like I don't know speed

420
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,320
control rotor current control all of

421
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,059
those great controls that you would get

422
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,179
on the wind turbine right so again

423
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,780
adapting to the adversary is key to

424
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,940
gather the right information and the

425
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,620
right Telemetry and why would you do

426
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,320
that right well because you can then

427
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
connect it to your fake scada system and

428
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,179
your fake scatter system must be

429
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,539
representative of what you have in real

430
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,380
life

431
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,900
and from there you can start gathering

432
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,940
information about like somethings on

433
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,500
this kind of system something is

434
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,200
browsing but most importantly right you

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,419
may want to know if someone pressed the

436
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,940
break button

437
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,860
imagine in a system

438
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,679
that whether it's deployed inside of

439
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,260
your network or outside of your network

440
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,740
someone applies the brake system on a

441
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,120
wind turbine

442
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,140
that becomes a red flag really fast and

443
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,720
the reason is if you start applying the

444
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,140
brig at the wrong time right you end up

445
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,000
like with the ring to Ryan that's on

446
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,140
fire so you can start interfering

447
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,840
urgency right so as long as the person

448
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,320
is there on that Decoy doing nothing and

449
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,160
having a look no urgency at all right

450
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,799
the moment they start interacting with a

451
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,380
system that's critical you may want to

452
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,660
be like that's something that the team

453
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,340
should be looking at okay

454
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,100
all of that's great but in order to

455
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,120
scale

456
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
you need to diversify so you need to

457
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,120
start building more decoys right an easy

458
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,179
Decor is that you can use like whether

459
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,780
you build them yourself or not are all

460
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,419
of those ones right you can go and build

461
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,000
an SSH box like you can go and spawn

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,580
Apache servers like blind Apache servers

463
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,980
like the logs will give you a lot of

464
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,020
information about people going through

465
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,919
like all of the directory busting type

466
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,900
stuff right so you start you start

467
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,400
getting quite a lot of information out

468
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,220
of that you may want like to spawn like

469
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,120
apis plc's and plcs is like great like I

470
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,360
think compote is great like if you are

471
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
onto like the Honeypot type stuff scada

472
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,140
system people

473
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,039
rdps like RDP wise so you start like

474
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,140
diversifying and diversifying gives you

475
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
like a bit more information about

476
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,960
anything that is going on online right

477
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,419
and the reason you may want to do that

478
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,820
is because like let's assume that you

479
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,419
want data that's

480
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,000
represent a specific sector well go and

481
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,220
deploy them on the cloud right and be

482
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,559
representative of that sector you start

483
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,720
getting like real-time data so an easy

484
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,200
way to do that and a cheap way is like

485
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,720
using like Google Cloud Amazon AWS as

486
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,179
your smaller Cloud providers and you can

487
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,419
get like cheap hosting and go and deploy

488
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,299
like very easily at tons of virtual

489
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,200
machines and tons of like dockerized

490
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,780
decos right now you're going to say well

491
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,880
how do I scale that because like it's a

492
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
lot of management right

493
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,100
so a couple of years ago there was like

494
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,179
the the modern honey Network and and

495
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,919
Nemo nice probably the wrong

496
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,620
pronunciation but essentially the those

497
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,840
tools allow you to actually register the

498
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,080
the decoys go and deploy the decoys and

499
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,039
it will essentially normalize all of the

500
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,500
logs that you get out of it right so

501
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,740
suddenly nowadays you could go and

502
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,620
deploy hundreds of decors gather all of

503
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,860
the data and what's left to you it's

504
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,440
just the analytics part

505
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,440
so I do it in two ways so we've got a

506
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,840
platform uh of course but essentially

507
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,539
you can use like your own normalization

508
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,240
scripts so I've got my own decoys I

509
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,760
deploy like hundreds of decoys every

510
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,520
single day and respawn them every single

511
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,100
day I use like keyboard and AR I'll

512
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,740
record like user sessions see what those

513
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,020
guys do and

514
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,260
you want to have like a breadth of type

515
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,159
of decoys as well so you do not need to

516
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,260
only have like high interaction decoys

517
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,419
you may want to have like a high

518
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,980
interaction decoys medium interaction

519
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,260
decoys low interaction decoys and the

520
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,679
idea is to gather as much data as

521
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,919
possible right and all of that data you

522
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,039
then can pass it to analytics right

523
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,260
the decoys that you have you can take

524
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,000
like them you can take them out of the

525
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,880
box so you really have two choices there

526
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,740
and the idea is like you take a decoy

527
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,600
out of the box and you see what type of

528
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
adversary anyway interacts with it right

529
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,780
or you go like a more stealth mode and

530
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,600
you tweak the decoy to maximum and you

531
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,340
change file system you change the

532
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,440
default usernames you modify like the

533
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
behavior of the decoy and suddenly you

534
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,179
can like pull a string and move the legs

535
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,520
of the dog move but the idea is that

536
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,320
essentially

537
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,380
different adversaries will be interested

538
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,140
by different systems and by having like

539
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,659
a plethora of systems you start seeing

540
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,840
different types of behaviors

541
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,299
if you only deploy the same decoy you

542
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,520
only get the same type of interaction

543
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,640
and that gives you limited data the

544
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
moment you start having diversity in

545
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,539
your decoys diversity in the information

546
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,080
that you get and diversity and like the

547
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,720
decoy types and the way those decoys are

548
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,960
are used you start getting like a lot

549
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,480
more information

550
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,539
so the way we do it essentially as we go

551
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,940
and deploy like thousands on decors we

552
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,220
pass everything down to Azure we do a

553
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,620
lot of analytics and we share that data

554
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,460
in your GUI but the way I have done it

555
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,340
is like use scripts you do essentially

556
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,039
that's for the deployment redeployment

557
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,559
you want to redeploy the decoys as soon

558
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,840
as possible so you may want to set

559
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,940
yourself with like a three hours go and

560
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,980
deploy a decode leave it for some place

561
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,500
redeploy it and do that like in a round

562
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,400
robin fashion across all of your regions

563
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,700
and the idea is to get the decoys for a

564
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,980
short period of time so difficult to

565
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,840
probe for an adversary

566
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,940
move it somewhere else

567
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,860
difficult to prove for the adversary and

568
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,080
so on and so forth

569
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,900
you get python you get all of the logs

570
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
you streamline all of the logs you do a

571
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,000
bit of analytics pass them into an SQL

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,880
database or to an elk stack and then you

573
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,400
get like amazing graphs about what's

574
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,980
happening if you want to use like mhn

575
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,440
right it's the same like you do the

576
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
analytics and you do the graphs so

577
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
there's plenty of ways of doing it and

578
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,400
now we'll go into one of the use cases

579
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,880
about Russians and what we found out and

580
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,919
the type of information we got out right

581
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,960
so

582
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,140
use case we thought at the start of the

583
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,740
war wouldn't it be interesting to figure

584
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,799
out if actually there is cyber warfare

585
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,419
going on

586
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,400
lots of people were talking about cyber

587
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,860
warfare like lots of people say it did

588
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,779
happen some people say they didn't

589
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,360
happen some people said well actually

590
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,419
it's ongoing so we thought well it would

591
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,380
be great to go and put a lot of decoys

592
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,400
out there

593
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,640
and understand what adversaries are

594
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,740
doing onto those decoys how are they

595
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,080
doing it right and what are the type of

596
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
adversaries that we encounter are they

597
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
all apts are they all like ransomware

598
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,679
groups are they all activists and what

599
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,779
are they interested in

600
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,320
and so we kind of went with like the

601
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,020
idea of leading adversaries down the

602
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,020
path right so the idea is that

603
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,200
see in that tunnel vision you want the

604
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,779
adversary to get something that they

605
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,940
want right so you need to give them

606
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,580
something that they might be interested

607
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,960
in so

608
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,059
idea of number one it's like you need

609
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,000
adversary where they want to go then you

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,700
go like I want to shape the adversaries

611
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,520
vision and the reason is you don't want

612
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,260
them to realize they're on the decoy too

613
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,039
fast

614
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,799
so that they get more confident and

615
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,020
being confident in an adversary is like

616
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,760
it's the same as like when you are doing

617
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,860
pen test right if you're doing pen test

618
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,779
and you find a piece of information you

619
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,580
get adrenaline you get endorphine you

620
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,440
get like all of those stuff and

621
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,080
adversaries have the same behavior right

622
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,279
so we actually want to talk to

623
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,900
psychologists to figure out all of those

624
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,640
great stuff and they told us well

625
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,720
actually right if you give them the

626
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,760
right information at the right time what

627
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,740
you end up with is the type of like too

628
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,900
good to be true type thing and the idea

629
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,539
is that

630
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,659
you get excited by the information that

631
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,120
you've just found and excitement is good

632
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,299
because suddenly you focus on that piece

633
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,500
of information

634
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,539
and as you focus on that piece of

635
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,100
information

636
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,520
you kind of forget what else there is

637
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
you kind of like go like I found that

638
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,140
piece of information I got a release of

639
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,080
endorphins and now I want endorphins

640
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,419
again so you kind of continue in that

641
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,440
way and at some point you become

642
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,000
emotionally involved with the data

643
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,159
you've already spent enough time on

644
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,200
getting some piece of data you've

645
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,940
already spent enough time onto that

646
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,919
Target that it's very difficult for an

647
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,799
adversary to turn around and say

648
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,320
actually I'm going down the wrong way

649
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,720
I'm gonna go and try something else and

650
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
at that stage it's great because they

651
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,320
will try anything to get to the place

652
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,539
you want them to be and they're more

653
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,580
likely to follow the path that that

654
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,400
you've provided so working on like

655
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,159
strong Jewel objectives right and

656
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,659
essentially

657
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,880
what you want out of this is you want

658
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,919
alerts so you want to know an adversar

659
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,840
is interacting with the decoys you want

660
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,020
ttps and you want like data that you can

661
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,600
use in a kind of forensic way and go

662
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,520
like that's the right adversary so I'm

663
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,500
actually targeting the right person and

664
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,620
I'm getting the right data right and by

665
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,840
tweaking your D course or tweaking the

666
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,880
the honeypots that you're using this is

667
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,740
an easy way of doing that

668
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,039
so you can like start fabricating lures

669
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,919
Ascension right so you can like go and

670
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,919
make fake files uh fake credentials fake

671
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,100
information and your objective with all

672
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,659
of that information is that at some

673
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,820
point to get data back whether it's like

674
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,559
an alert on a fake account that's being

675
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,440
compromised uh alert on on compromised

676
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,260
accounts so for example what you want is

677
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,480
like an adversary to go and say I'm

678
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,059
going to use that email address and

679
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,919
password that I've gained somewhere

680
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,900
because it seemed to be an Associated

681
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,659
system and suddenly you've started

682
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,419
Gathering Intel right and it's cool

683
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,120
Intel because you can then Trace that

684
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,580
back from maybe someone like clicking on

685
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,980
a phishing link right and giving their

686
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,340
credentials out and you want maybe

687
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,380
alerts on key accounts so that's like a

688
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,760
bit more on the analytics you want to

689
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
see if like key accounts have been

690
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,720
compromised and so that's what we did so

691
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,899
we went out and we kind of like put like

692
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,140
SSH boxes apis we bought like a couple

693
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,200
of scada systems up uh we put like fake

694
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
environmental websites we put developers

695
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,700
websites we've done like everything you

696
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,779
can imagine

697
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,000
we've actually deployed it at some point

698
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,899
and the idea is like let them come to us

699
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,140
let's see what information we get out of

700
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,860
them

701
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,899
that they are willing to give us

702
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,700
and so

703
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,460
we were not just gonna wait right so we

704
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,559
decided okay where are they hanging out

705
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,840
right and if you look at the it Army of

706
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,419
Ukraine most of them are telegram the

707
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,980
telegram channel is Super Active so

708
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,200
we're like well the chances are they've

709
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,580
got a couple of telegram channels as

710
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,080
well right so we went on telegram

711
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,840
channels and we started leaking data out

712
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,820
like we got someone that speaks Russian

713
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
you know just to make sure that it

714
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,279
sounded nice we got active on the

715
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,500
telegram Channel just to not use like an

716
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,720
account that has just been created and

717
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,880
we started interacting with them and

718
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,740
suddenly we started

719
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,779
sharing information ourselves and we're

720
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,600
like hey look we found this that seems

721
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,279
to be a developer website that seemed to

722
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,440
be like an Associated box there's a

723
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,059
vulnerability there have you thought

724
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,640
about this right we went slightly

725
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
further we started creating like GitHub

726
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,320
accounts and the ideas like let's leak

727
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,360
some SSH keys and all of those great

728
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
stuff down there so that if someone

729
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,700
searches for something like in relation

730
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,279
for the Ukrainian government for example

731
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,620
they might actually find like some

732
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,720
information some Intel

733
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,260
down like a place where you think we've

734
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,520
not thought about so we started like

735
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,919
replicating like a couple of GitHub

736
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,140
accounts that kind of look legitimate

737
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,840
and leaked information there we went

738
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,659
like down the the dark web linked

739
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,220
information on forums and the idea is

740
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,899
like really different types of

741
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,360
information on different places and the

742
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,980
reason is then we can see which one

743
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,200
works the best right so if you start

744
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,220
like

745
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,620
leaking everything everywhere you get a

746
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,840
problem but if you start like

747
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,000
segregating the information and you say

748
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,399
okay that that like login in password or

749
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,679
that email I've I've shared it like only

750
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,960
there you go like oh that's that's where

751
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,580
they are active that's where they

752
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,840
actually use that piece of information

753
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,820
right then you make sure that you're

754
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,460
indexed on Showdown right and then you

755
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,559
get like on on this bin and you put a

756
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,840
couple of other stuff and we did like a

757
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,820
couple more of of those

758
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,520
um we try to get like ourselves into

759
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,460
like data leaks right and then we

760
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,200
sharing the leaks with like the

761
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,760
information that we had added as well

762
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
right so at some point like if someone

763
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,640
re-indexes it uh on have I been pawned

764
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,140
like your email address might actually

765
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,899
be like in that specific stuff as well

766
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,140
in that specific document and suddenly

767
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,120
you start seeing things emerging right

768
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,520
within a couple of minutes of sharing on

769
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,980
on some of the on some of the medium we

770
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,260
started seeing like folks like targeting

771
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,620
or opening the files so one of them like

772
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,419
this is probably a group someone

773
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,460
downloading downloaded one of the files

774
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,220
and then suddenly the same file was

775
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,679
opened like in Russia in France in

776
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,360
Russia and Germany in Sao Paulo in

777
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,620
Russia and Russia in France and in

778
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,640
Russia and we're like okay that's

779
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
interesting right so they've not

780
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,600
downloaded 10 times the file they

781
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,640
actually have downloaded the file and

782
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
then went to share it with one another

783
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,020
and so I should have put the timeline

784
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,940
here but it's the space of like 30

785
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,580
minutes right so the file was passed on

786
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,100
and then like maybe on the Forum or

787
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,720
something or in a chat and then like

788
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,340
everybody was like opening the file and

789
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,019
it's just like a beaconing file the same

790
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,700
as like what you'd find on Canary things

791
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,760
essentially right and

792
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,760
you then look at those IPS and you go

793
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,279
like okay now what we want to do is like

794
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,799
obviously we want to track those folks

795
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,080
like if they suddenly appear on one of

796
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,419
the decoys that we've set up and Yeah we

797
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,940
actually found some of them uh I think

798
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,500
one of the one of the guys like who's

799
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,659
like uh tried to use like an old reverse

800
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,399
shell that was like 10 years old right

801
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,140
we actually found the code so he

802
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,960
uploaded that stuff uh onto onto a Linux

803
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,899
box that only works for Windows right

804
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,600
okay fair enough like whatever you want

805
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,480
right like really besides it's okay you

806
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,220
can you can you can do that if you want

807
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,600
right

808
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,519
um but and that was like a couple of

809
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,980
minutes afterwards so this is I think

810
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,779
what we look like look how excited we

811
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,059
were right or at least this is how I

812
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,100
pictured it anyway because like we are a

813
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,219
fully remote company so but if if we had

814
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,918
been behind the same computer I think we

815
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,719
would have been as excited as those

816
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,960
people and essentially we started

817
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,480
getting like a couple of cool stuff

818
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,000
right the the botnet uh enrollment

819
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,800
that's obvious right like they always

820
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,739
always want to enroll you in a bot mid

821
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,139
um interestingly stuff like some of

822
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,599
those guys like decided to go to do like

823
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,359
uh curl scripts against Ukrainian

824
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,300
government like oh

825
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,599
fair enough right but I think it's like

826
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,899
you know in kind of like

827
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,460
distributed Daniel of service so you go

828
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,119
and compromise a host somewhere and then

829
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,639
suddenly you make requests of like a

830
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,379
Ukrainian government you probably need

831
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,739
to comprise a lot of hosts until that

832
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,020
makes something but it was fun to see

833
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,140
the level like which is literally zero

834
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,480
of some of those folks

835
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,880
um and then they were like

836
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,080
um

837
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,660
yeah so they we used like we got like a

838
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,300
couple of leaked credentials uh couldn't

839
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,800
read them that's like it's like too

840
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,119
small I'm too old

841
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,680
um but essentially it should turn every

842
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,640
time

843
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,740
um we started having leaked credentials

844
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,180
on some of some of the decoys so we

845
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,940
started seeing like some of the folks uh

846
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,359
brute forcing some of our decoys right

847
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:28,560
and there's a there's a couple of

848
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,500
interesting stuff there that it's a

849
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,440
behavior we've seen before in the in the

850
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,020
fintech industry where someone started

851
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,119
reinforcing a decode

852
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
and suddenly you get like a lot of

853
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,119
dictionary attacks right and you're like

854
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,280
oh that's that's an interesting way of

855
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,140
doing it like everybody does the same

856
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,900
but then at some point

857
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,839
maybe like 72 weight C2 to 80 hours

858
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,780
later someone changes tactic and

859
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,079
suddenly you've got like a single email

860
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,820
brute forcing or the bridge Force for a

861
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,619
single username and you go like that's

862
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,480
that's an interesting change of Taxi so

863
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,880
obviously they know something about that

864
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,460
particular person or that particular

865
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,180
um

866
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,920
yeah the particular person or that

867
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,660
particular credential so obviously that

868
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,460
that's the person with uh maybe

869
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,079
Authority that's a person with

870
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,640
administrative rights or those kind of

871
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
stuff and then at some point like

872
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,000
another maybe 24 hours 48 hours later we

873
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,099
started like a seeing like another

874
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,960
Behavior where

875
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,599
interestingly enough they had gone and

876
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,900
uh taken like some information elsewhere

877
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,119
and we see them like using that

878
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,060
information to log in onto

879
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,099
um onto the decoys

880
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,599
but with

881
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,460
valid credentials

882
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,020
and

883
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,720
the password looks like a real password

884
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
it looks like something that has

885
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
complexity and you just go like oh

886
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,760
that's interesting and so it turns out

887
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,619
some of those passwords have been leaked

888
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,359
online and then they are passing and

889
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,800
essentially what they do like At first

890
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,720
we thought maybe they've gone on have I

891
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,820
been pawned and those kind of stuff for

892
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,380
this type for this one we actually

893
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,260
realized that uh some folks were

894
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,780
actually selling databases of of logins

895
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,359
for some of the defense and they

896
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,400
actually were using those databases

897
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,460
because like we had a lot of like one

898
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,099
try like a username that seemed valid

899
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,839
and a complex password and that that

900
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,400
usually is like a weird thing because

901
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,380
it's a it's a bridge for us but it's

902
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,359
still one try on that one it's not like

903
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,760
admin a thousand times with like a

904
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,040
random password so you start seeing like

905
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,920
things that well you can get information

906
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,460
out right we also get like uh one that

907
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,800
we call the dumb way to die uh and I

908
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,060
don't know if like you've been on nine

909
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,880
Gaggers like dumb ways to die is quite

910
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,339
good song but dumb ways to die like

911
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,320
we've got like this straight actor uh

912
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,640
and it's Russian

913
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,760
and we assume it's a group right

914
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,000
connects to an SFTP and then it goes

915
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,839
like

916
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm not going to check anything on the

917
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,119
SFTP it's not not interested at all of

918
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,619
what's on the XF TV but he starts

919
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,380
uploading files and like all our

920
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,960
phishing emails like but like 5 000

921
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,700
different types of phishing events right

922
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,300
and then XLS files with like all of the

923
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,460
all of the emails that he's gonna send

924
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,800
those information to

925
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,339
so it then like uploads like his PHP uh

926
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,940
recovery page uh he uploads like the the

927
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,460
picture of like the folks that are

928
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,740
essentially that if credentials being

929
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,119
leaked

930
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,339
um and it starts collecting data and so

931
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,320
we thought well you know what would be

932
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,839
fun as like we started eating like the

933
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,780
the 5000 email template and in the email

934
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,400
template we are like this is a phishing

935
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,859
email in red right

936
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,079
so we added like a couple of four email

937
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,900
addresses into the list and to this day

938
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,119
three months later we still receive

939
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,280
emails which go like this is a fishing

940
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,619
email so obviously they've not they

941
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,839
don't really care or at least that one

942
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,400
that's one group doesn't really care

943
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,520
about the fact that he's not getting

944
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,200
fishing anymore because obviously

945
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,339
everybody has received the email

946
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,800
received this is a phishing email

947
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,020
and they've not even realized that they

948
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,099
are not getting that information

949
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,440
everything is like written in Russian so

950
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,460
obviously

951
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,859
they are Russian but

952
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,960
it doesn't work anymore but it's a cool

953
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,940
thing that like we keep monitoring him

954
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,460
and they keep they keep adding like uh

955
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,680
stuff onto onto the list so they keep

956
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,660
like sending out more to more and more

957
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,060
users so we've started trying too much

958
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,220
where do they get those users from where

959
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,140
do they get are they scraping the web

960
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,880
from those emails so we started by

961
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,920
trying to figure out where all of that

962
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,020
comes from we divide the lists from

963
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,960
somewhere and so far like most of the

964
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,180
emails in that list do not come from the

965
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,980
internet they are not public on the

966
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,240
internet we thought well maybe that's

967
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,980
how they get it but we've not been able

968
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,560
to find where do they get so many emails

969
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,280
so fast so we were we were hypothetizing

970
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,599
that like at some point maybe the

971
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,280
compromise organizations they get the

972
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,660
emails from the organizations they've

973
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,820
compromised they pull it into the list

974
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,980
and then they try and again and again

975
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,960
and again so we've not been able to

976
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,300
verify and we are not exactly sure how

977
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,000
to verify it yet but that's part of part

978
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,579
of the plan other cool stuff that that

979
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:23,280
we get from from all of that is like a

980
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,079
lot of critical infrastructures in the

981
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,380
EU and U.S compromised see how we kind

982
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,900
of told them like we leaked credentials

983
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,599
and we wanted to see who was attacking

984
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,200
us well we realized that like out of the

985
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,540
domains or the IP apart like apparent to

986
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,480
to domains they are apparented to like

987
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,520
critical infrastructures in the UN in

988
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,020
you and us

989
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,980
um we got like um uh infrastructure that

990
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,320
launched attacks against us so

991
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,200
apparently there's a PLC in a dump that

992
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,900
keeps like sending out like packets to

993
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,079
us uh we got a Fortune 500 company uh

994
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,460
we've got a lot of Health Care so

995
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,440
yesterday the

996
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,880
um

997
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,700
a junk director and I'm sorry a messy

998
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,980
mess up his title a junk director of the

999
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,280
FBI was in Aberdeen at the OT Summit

1000
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,460
where we were and he had a list of like

1001
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,619
most compromised infrastructure and

1002
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,740
Healthcare was one of the top ones and

1003
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,619
we see a lot of healthcare organizations

1004
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,880
ourselves

1005
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,579
attacking or decoy or interacting with

1006
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,859
our decoys so

1007
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,619
to us that's great that FBI confirms

1008
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,079
what we do or we were conferring them I

1009
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,520
can't remember like one of the other

1010
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,040
right and we started like having OT

1011
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,400
attacking us like a finance organization

1012
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,440
attacking us and that's interesting to

1013
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,599
see how all of those organizations have

1014
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,579
been comprised now for the just jumping

1015
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,440
back to the healthcare one what was

1016
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,540
interesting is like on the 15 or 16s

1017
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,160
that we've seen

1018
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,460
a couple of weeks later they all suffer

1019
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,440
a ransomware attack

1020
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,200
so we thought

1021
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,540
actually those guys are clever they

1022
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,560
maximize right first they compromise

1023
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,240
they may get the data out or some of the

1024
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,380
data out

1025
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,500
then the launch attack against like

1026
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,099
Ukraine decoys like any Targets that

1027
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,599
they might think of

1028
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,400
and then once they finish with the

1029
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,140
infrastructure or maybe they believe

1030
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,460
they are on the verge of being

1031
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,140
discovered in that infrastructure they

1032
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,599
go like run somewhere so now suddenly

1033
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,400
they've got like some of the data out

1034
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,020
which might be

1035
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,960
Ransom number one right and then run

1036
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,240
somewhere run some number two whether

1037
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,740
they want to do that or not but that's

1038
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,599
interesting so we are we are keeping

1039
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,980
monitoring the rest of those

1040
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,200
infrastructure to see if they all suffer

1041
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,359
the same pattern and if they suffer the

1042
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,500
same pattern it's quite interesting

1043
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,200
because those guys definitely are good

1044
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,359
at maximizing and they know exactly what

1045
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,460
they're doing and the question is now

1046
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,680
are they divided in multiple groups

1047
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,440
following the same kind of thing right

1048
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,599
like maybe they all follow the same

1049
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,260
routine right or is this the same group

1050
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,960
that we've seen and like maybe it's like

1051
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,079
super large or maybe there's someone

1052
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,420
that shared that this is probably the

1053
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,940
best way of doing it right

1054
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,660
we don't know yet but as we move forward

1055
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,940
we start getting that information and

1056
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,160
more and more information about like we

1057
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,900
start building that picture that

1058
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,760
contextual picture of what adversaries

1059
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,220
are are doing uh of course we gathered

1060
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,839
quite a lot of scripts

1061
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,140
um but that scripts like dito scripts

1062
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,500
and crypto miners of those great stuff

1063
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,200
not really interesting interested for

1064
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,480
for us is we're not going to go and

1065
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,520
reverse engineer them right but like we

1066
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,619
keep Gathering them and constituting our

1067
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,260
malware zoo and the scripts like some of

1068
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,520
them are interesting

1069
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,740
some of them slightly less right like we

1070
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,319
see quite a lot of them using like they

1071
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,500
are not custom scripts right so if you

1072
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,300
paste the code in GitHub you'll find the

1073
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,520
code so obviously they use GitHub quite

1074
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,560
a lot so they reuse like code that

1075
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,780
someone else has written

1076
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,140
um we have seen a couple of scripts that

1077
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,319
the you can clearly see it's made for

1078
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,480
them it contains like Russian language

1079
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,940
it contains like it can clearly unless

1080
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,680
it's a false like operation but the

1081
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,300
chances are

1082
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,359
probably not right but we start seeing

1083
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,940
like cool stuff happening over and over

1084
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,540
again and that tells us that indeed they

1085
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,260
often focus more on the flag that caring

1086
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,140
about what's on the odd skirt now

1087
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,380
you can go and do that right now by

1088
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,020
deploying decoys yourself right but we

1089
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,380
thought why stop there

1090
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,339
why not just go and gather

1091
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,920
even more intelligence right like maybe

1092
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,619
we can just like automate all of the

1093
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,380
stuff that I've talked to you

1094
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,819
but go the extra mile so we went on and

1095
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,020
we created like clusters decode clusters

1096
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:17,300
and we went like Fulham like space iot

1097
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,220
Healthcare oil and gas Finance

1098
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,000
operational we've got maybe 20 clusters

1099
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,119
and we make them move all the time and

1100
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,220
we create more decoys all the time and

1101
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,680
we adapt decoys all the time and we have

1102
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,900
like

1103
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,319
a shitload of decoys right

1104
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,920
and the idea as like not only Gathering

1105
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,420
the noise

1106
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,180
it's reacting to people

1107
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,000
we want to react to what those folks are

1108
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,859
doing so

1109
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,680
we went like what if we could deploy

1110
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,220
those decos on events right but like

1111
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,260
what I'm saying on veins it's like

1112
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,540
really on events like 10 minutes of an

1113
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,700
event happening you want decoys to be

1114
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,859
like skinned

1115
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,520
and usable right and the idea is that

1116
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,220
the moment something happens you start

1117
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,260
getting that real-time data flowing in

1118
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,200
right the moment something happens you

1119
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,300
start leaking data automatically to

1120
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,280
different places right because we've

1121
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,079
already figured out how to do it like

1122
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,140
plenty of those places of apis so you

1123
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,119
start like can we generate data and

1124
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,060
automate data of course at some point it

1125
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,619
might become obvious but by that time

1126
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,180
we'll figure something out and we'll

1127
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,220
start creating new accounts and you know

1128
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,079
rotating so

1129
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,060
we now go on events like a pipeline

1130
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,700
exploding in a nursing bomb D course

1131
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,920
like put in speech

1132
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,900
look how beautiful it is giving that

1133
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,060
speech decoys

1134
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,520
Biden and do that right in Poland like

1135
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,359
couple of days ago decoys like or brief

1136
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,040
Chancellor Charles that has finally

1137
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,359
admitted that he was going to give

1138
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,480
thanks decoms like just pop decoys like

1139
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,960
earthquake in Turkey decos the idea is

1140
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,060
just like every time something happened

1141
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,920
in the world will just pop stuff up and

1142
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,740
again not that complicated

1143
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,839
like once you've built a couple of the

1144
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:16,740
scripts

1145
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,440
you just press a button the decoys get

1146
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,740
deployed you write to a couple of apis

1147
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,560
data gets deployed and it doesn't matter

1148
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,680
if you get nothing out of it

1149
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,420
what matters is that if you get

1150
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,640
something out of it right

1151
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,520
the idea is like to get quite a lot of

1152
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,140
information and then you just have to

1153
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,180
filter the information but because you

1154
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,619
know that nothing should touch them

1155
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:42,660
right technically no nothing should

1156
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,760
touch your decode anything that touches

1157
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,980
it is probably malicious and anything

1158
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,740
that they will put against you know if

1159
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,680
like it's unimportant you'll be able to

1160
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,359
filter it because some of that

1161
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,300
information will be known to you at some

1162
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,760
point you start finding patterns

1163
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,819
like these guys right this couple of

1164
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:06,839
patterns so 164 is a number that we see

1165
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,599
all the time

1166
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,060
164 interaction on any of your servers

1167
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,859
any of interaction from an IP address

1168
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,079
it's a scanner that's what they do it's

1169
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,420
like that that number 164 never changes

1170
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,500
there's hundreds of ips just doing 164.

1171
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,260
there's hundreds of Ip doing 21 to 33 25

1172
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,380
same they look for like a very similar

1173
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,940
vulnerability

1174
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,579
sometimes there's a tiny variation but

1175
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,460
now you start like finding out like all

1176
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,000
of the scanners so what do you look for

1177
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,099
you look for the one instruction you

1178
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,900
look for the less interaction you look

1179
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,260
for the person that goes connects and

1180
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,000
use something that you've not seen

1181
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,700
before so you start filtering quite a

1182
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,640
lot of that noise right

1183
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,520
but sometimes noise is good you don't

1184
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,020
want to filter all of it what you want

1185
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,460
to do is like

1186
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,640
in a and a data Lake type thing is like

1187
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,160
hot cold pipeline right type thing right

1188
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,260
where you've got something that you

1189
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,000
spill out directly because you know what

1190
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,680
it is and then you've got a couple of

1191
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,020
stuff that you keep you know at the back

1192
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,579
of your mind and when you've got the

1193
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,140
analytics capability you just go and

1194
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,900
like dig through it right and so for

1195
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,140
example the esxi mask on that was

1196
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,359
happening a couple of weeks ago we saw

1197
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,400
it happening almost intense

1198
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,339
instantaneously we were like oh someone

1199
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,560
is scanning that cord like plenty of

1200
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,740
times like I think our CTO which is like

1201
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,079
Aberdeen graduate was like have you seen

1202
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:39,240
this and I was like yeah I'm not exactly

1203
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,619
sure what's happening right like because

1204
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,740
we saw it happen but we were not sure up

1205
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,380
until a VH went like hey someone's

1206
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,819
trying to exploit that one vulnerability

1207
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,319
and we're like Ah that's what's

1208
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,040
happening so obviously there's time when

1209
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,339
we rely on other to tell us what we see

1210
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,400
right but context we've already got

1211
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,859
quite a lot of data so what did right on

1212
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,839
that kind of like vulnerability because

1213
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,960
it was like the look 4J kind of scale we

1214
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,819
gathered all of the IP we started blog

1215
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,440
post and like LinkedIn posts and we're

1216
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,880
like hey here are all of the IPS that

1217
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,220
you may want to block right because

1218
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,500
that's that's what we see all around the

1219
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,079
world so just go and block them but then

1220
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,660
you also see other trends like putting

1221
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,099
speech

1222
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:26,160
increase of attacks on our decoys only

1223
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,579
in France and Germany nobody else right

1224
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:31,200
so France and Germany obviously have

1225
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
done something right so why have they

1226
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,060
been targeted rather than the UK good

1227
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,300
question right but if you were

1228
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,720
uh defense organization in France during

1229
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,940
Putin's speech you were probably

1230
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,680
targeted

1231
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,740
if you were like a company associated in

1232
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,540
Germany associated with the defense

1233
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,280
sector you were targeted as well so you

1234
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,839
start like seeing like cool stuff like

1235
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,359
this Biden shakes do does hand obviously

1236
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,480
like it was against Poland and this time

1237
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,859
it was against manufacturing

1238
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,359
specifically

1239
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,819
all the other type of clusters were left

1240
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,280
intact so no healthcare no nothing it

1241
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,020
was just manufacturing for some reason

1242
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,480
that taken an interest in manufacturing

1243
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,720
we don't know why but if you were at

1244
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,359
that moment in Poland having a company

1245
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,000
with a vulnerability in manufacturing

1246
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,880
you might have been part of that

1247
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,240
exploitation so we see a lot of the same

1248
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,520
password lists being used which is great

1249
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,099
like probably useless as long as like

1250
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,859
you don't use default passwords same CVS

1251
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:36,780
being scanned for and what we see is

1252
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,760
like after a couple of minutes you start

1253
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,339
seeing like a lot of people like a CV is

1254
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:43,859
being exploited like the esxi and

1255
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,599
suddenly you see more and more and more

1256
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,859
people but they're not the same group

1257
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,480
what you want to gather is that

1258
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,040
information at the start like the groups

1259
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,380
like would have compromised really at

1260
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,780
the start so because like the the ones

1261
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,400
that are added like about an hour later

1262
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,260
they are not the same one scanning

1263
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,819
they're probably someone that is just

1264
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,200
doing mascaling because the mass

1265
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,760
scanning is happening and is being

1266
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,500
reported right but

1267
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,000
um interesting to see who's attacking

1268
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,740
hook because obviously we start seeing

1269
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,680
like oh that scanner we see them in like

1270
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,079
in in very specific regions and we start

1271
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,700
like seeing scanners like attacking like

1272
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,339
specific types of cloud or specific

1273
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:19,619
types of region or sometimes like a

1274
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,599
specific sector in a very specific

1275
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,660
region so you start like funneling all

1276
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,300
of the data and Gathering like some

1277
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,520
contextual intelligence that might apply

1278
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,460
specifically to you right and that is

1279
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,220
real time and obviously the emergence of

1280
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,559
of a lot of patterns and a lot more

1281
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,180
right but that would be like totally

1282
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,339
another talk so in a couple of months

1283
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:44,220
right we got like 5.5 billion signals

1284
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,800
right which is like a lot to treat but

1285
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,220
you don't need to go to that scale for

1286
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,760
you to get the benefits out of it right

1287
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,440
you could deploy a couple of decodes

1288
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,160
tonight on your infrastructure right and

1289
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,040
a couple of outside and start doing a

1290
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,079
tiny bit of analytics and you'd still

1291
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,559
get interesting data as long as you know

1292
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,240
the data that you're Gathering if you

1293
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,460
deploy teapot

1294
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,319
I'm telling you you will not get

1295
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,480
anything of value like the value will be

1296
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,400
zero but if you start deploying

1297
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,380
something that is a bit interesting a

1298
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,940
bit tweaked

1299
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,520
to your organization

1300
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,579
is targeting like valued data

1301
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,700
so we obviously share that data for free

1302
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,400
right at uh our community version from

1303
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,740
the triple hist.io so you can go and put

1304
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,900
an IP address and you'll see where they

1305
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,880
come from and what they've done and

1306
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,980
actually if we believe it's a human will

1307
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,180
tell you it's an indicator of

1308
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,520
intelligence by the way so that's like

1309
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,800
only down to us

1310
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,400
use it anywhere you want because if you

1311
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,960
see it you mean if you've got a way to

1312
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,420
identify a human right but it has an

1313
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,400
indicator of intelligence that's what we

1314
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,160
started doing we think it's even

1315
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,140
for whatever reason

1316
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,780
you may want to spend some time on that

1317
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,599
unit right as a maybe a sock analyst or

1318
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,300
like anything that gets an alert right

1319
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,339
so in conclusion and because I don't

1320
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,440
have time anymore and I want like time

1321
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,180
for hard questions turn the table

1322
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,220
anniversary 10 minutes it's not that

1323
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,599
difficult go and deploy a couple of

1324
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,400
dockerized stuff

1325
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,099
obtain unparalleled data the data that

1326
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,140
you're gonna get out of deploying this

1327
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,960
is going to be better than most of the

1328
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,240
things you get as long as you tweak it

1329
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,980
and you know the data you're obtaining

1330
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,380
right like machine learning only applies

1331
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,839
if you have the right data not every

1332
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,540
data is right for machine learning uh

1333
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,099
you get zero two low flows positive

1334
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,480
because like the chances are like

1335
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,940
anything touches in touching it is like

1336
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,700
a false like it's a true positive right

1337
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,480
and then you can obtain contextual so

1338
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,920
that's deception you deploy deception

1339
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,300
within your own environment maybe

1340
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,800
outside of your network that's

1341
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,680
contextual to you nobody else gets that

1342
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,480
the moment you start deploying the cloud

1343
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,540
and you get like uh deception which is

1344
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,500
like

1345
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,200
more Global essentially so you can do a

1346
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,020
mix of both of those Technologies to

1347
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,720
start informing your next step

1348
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,720
and that's all Focus for today

1349
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,339
any questions

1350
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:31,980
no oh that's disappointing please ask me

1351
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,460
a question yeah

1352
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,140
taxi has changed at all because

1353
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,760
obviously it has more mainstream

1354
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,760
confidence

1355
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,160
they stay about the same and it's not as

1356
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,059
simple to change your tactics right it's

1357
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,619
not something that's

1358
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,020
you can change from today to tomorrow

1359
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,880
you still need to do a bit of research

1360
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,440
like if you're going to exploit another

1361
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,119
vulnerability you need to figure out

1362
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,619
what vulnerability you're going to be

1363
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,140
able to go and exploit at a scale that

1364
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,300
is the same so there's a there's a

1365
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,300
couple of things that

1366
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,839
not prevent them but hinder them

1367
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:16,079
to be changing very fast

1368
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,480
Ascension

1369
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,200
so but I think over time they evolve

1370
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,200
right so depending on what's Happening

1371
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,040
and so for example ransomware has

1372
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,700
decreased right so tactics will evolve

1373
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,760
until it picks up again right for for

1374
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,400
any reason so I think there's a there's

1375
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,980
an evolution but it's not like a 360

1376
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,200
Degrees to something different

1377
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,480
yeah

1378
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,839
have you ever have you tried deploying

1379
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:53,640
Hollywood's in like a reverse context so

1380
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,160
like you talk about how

1381
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,460
important

1382
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:02,880
that said ever tried

1383
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
um

1384
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,099
yes we did

1385
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,720
but I cannot tell you what the answer is

1386
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,599
so two more minutes any questions

1387
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,680
like basically we are a deception

1388
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,780
company right so well we'll sell you

1389
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,000
deception and we sell you access to the

1390
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,240
the data Lake essentially right uh no

1391
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,819
there's plenty of like uh ways like one

1392
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:46,859
of the one we work with a lot of mssp

1393
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,680
mostly right but if you say I'm gonna go

1394
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,000
and place D chords and kind of like

1395
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,859
access to data we're always happy to

1396
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,260
ever have a chat right about like some

1397
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,540
of the some of the stuff that that we do

1398
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,180
essentially so we're pretty open that's

1399
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,220
the cool stuff about the startup isn't

1400
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,540
it

1401
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,740
yeah

1402
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,900
it's cool you've got a pretty

1403
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,440
good night

1404
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,720
all right so that's that's something

1405
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,660
that we're like probably you always want

1406
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,640
to gain some intelligence right one of

1407
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,440
the things that we currently recently

1408
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,059
wondered is like anybody querying the

1409
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:23,819
API because they want to see if they've

1410
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:26,579
been found right as a threat actor right

1411
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:29,160
and that's a that's an interesting

1412
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,839
question

1413
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:35,099
um so at the moment no but definitely

1414
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:36,780
looking into it it's like we've got like

1415
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,680
a a set of plenty of open questions

1416
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,040
and I think that's the end yeah there we

1417
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,079
go no questions that's it
