1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,060
hello everyone uh it's really exciting

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,680
to be here uh obviously we've been

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,120
organizing this for a long period of

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,099
time so we're very excited for it to be

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,259
finally happening uh so really just

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,820
quickly gonna talk a little bit about

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,379
security

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,000
um and kind of what today will be about

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,520
so

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,740
first of all so we introduction I don't

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,939
know what this joke has been made before

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,939
but uh if it has sorry I guess uh hello

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,599
I'm Sophie I'm joined by Alan and Connor

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,840
and Tristan today so

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,940
that's the committee of the year

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,800
um so before we get into it I swear

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
we're not picking a random animal every

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
year I promise

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,980
um so the reason we have the whales is

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,079
because uh if you have been in Dundee

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,160
you might have seen the big whale

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,840
sculpture

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,440
um

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,940
so we had Mel who is somewhere probably

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,300
um she made up these logos for us so

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,160
you'll probably see them on a bunch of

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,320
the merchandise and throughout the day

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,359
uh the reason we have that is obviously

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
big sculpture and because Dundee has

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,119
pretty big whaling history so that's the

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,700
reason I swear not random animal

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,659
thank you

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,360
and so you're gonna be tired of this

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,060
Scottish guidelines University policy no

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,220
longer say masks we're not enforcing a

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,700
policy and we would

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,740
encourage you to be careful because

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,420
there are a lot of people from a lot of

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,220
different places here and there are a

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,619
lot of things going around but up to you

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,540
be conscious of others if someone's

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,119
isolated isolating but um shielding

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,560
whatever you know the don't look off

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,380
from them and there's still hand

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,360
sanitizer all over the university so

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,159
feel free to just um

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
use it so our portal photos I didn't see

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,579

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,540
um

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,460
more importantly just now health and

51
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,860
safety there are no planned fire drills

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,140

54

132
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,259
actually a slight change to schedule

133
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,020
um for track one after the keynote uh

134
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,280
unfortunately you do unforeseen

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,740
circumstances one of them had to cancel

136
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,720
um instead of the assessing threat

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,340
actors and quantifying cyber risk we're

138
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,220
going to have Ian Ferguson presenting uh

139
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,800

140
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,180
a new source of digital forensics

141
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,580
evidence so yeah that's going to be

foreign

176
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,020
yeah so in your bags you will probably

177
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,699
notice you have a sponsored bingo card

178
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,919
so the idea is that you get that stamped

179
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,139
by every single sponsor that is at the

180
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,660
event and once you do that uh you'll

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,580
have noticed a box in the middle of the

182
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,979
main sponsor area uh with all the snacks

183
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,680
around it if you put the completed uh

184
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
sponsor Bingo cards on there make sure

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,100
you've written your name on the back of

186
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,139
it so that we can call you out

187
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,840
um when we pull out for the prizes so

188
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,340
yeah put the sponsor picker card in

189
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,240
