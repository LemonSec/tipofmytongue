1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,000
so welcome to the talk uh I'm just gonna

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
start I suppose on a little bit of

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,200
information about myself uh

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,580
I don't think this is working don't mind

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,160
so yeah my name is Isaac bus Grace I'm a

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,420
fourth year ethical hacking student

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,880
currently doing my dissertation on video

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,740
game anti-cheat which is sound playing

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,779
oh my God everything's happening

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,980
okay

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
um yeah so I'm really interested in

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,060
threat intelligence reverse engineering

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,160
when those analytics and tunnels and

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,980
obviously open source intelligence

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,260
um that's my uh that's my Twitter handle

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,219
right there if you wanna if you want to

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,480
give me a follow I need to get to 500

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,000
followers thank you very much and I used

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,219
to be a pretty weird kid right

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,760
so when I was growing up I spent a lot

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,000
of time watching uh UFO documentaries

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,399
with my nan like you know your unsolved

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,960
mystery Your History Channel

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,360
documentaries

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,579
um and I was always like it sort of made

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,800
me quite anxious as a child and you know

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
obviously still quite anxious at the

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,680
moment this talk is very heavily

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,379
influenced by that young sort of anxiety

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,119
that I had

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,760
um obviously as I grew up uh I realized

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,460
that Ancient Aliens and know UFO

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,600
abductions and this kind of thing

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,080
doesn't happen not real but the

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,820
uh sort of

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,820
the interest that I had growing up still

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,500
remained but with a little bit more of a

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,380
skeptical lens fitted to it you know

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Occam's razor says uh the simplest

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,939
answer is obviously is usually the

41
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,040
correct one and I definitely believe

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,140
that so

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,619
let's start with uh what are UFOs it's

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,119
probably a little bit of a silly

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,259
question right what are they they are

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,799
unidentified flying objects so if you

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,299
take that like face value UFOs are real

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,799
like if you don't know what a plane is

49
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,180
if you don't know what a bird is they're

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,860
UFOs right

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,680
whether they're aliens

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,460
no no so uh I should mention that the

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,600
various sort of governments of the world

54
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
tend to prefer UAP these days

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,680
unidentified uh

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,800
yeah unidentified aerial phenomena

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,220
because not all sort of uo UFO sightings

58
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,160
are um actual physical objects sometimes

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,200
they can be like weird way that light

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,780
reflects off of the uh you know off of

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,400
the clouds or whatever they're not

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,379
always physical things

63
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,180
um and it also means that there's less

64
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,580
stigma attached to it so like

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,040
um let's say uh military officer goes to

66
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,379
a superior and starts talking about

67
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,660
seeing a UFO most people will start

68
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,099
thinking oh you've seen little green

69
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,780
Manny you know they'll start taking the

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,700
piss out of and whatever in real like if

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
you change that to UAP that stigma has

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,959
been removed much more useful across the

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,220
board

74
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,720
um yeah what is this talk actually about

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,400
um so I'm going to be going over quite a

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,560
few examples of uaps caught in images

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,379
and on video I'm aiming to provide a

78
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,360
logical rational reasonable explanation

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,300
using pretty simple ocean techniques my

80
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,099
aim with this talk is to make sure that

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,420
everyone can sort of understand it and

82
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,620
not just have like a high level

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,480
technical like a low level technical

84
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
overview you know

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,800
um I think the explanation is often just

86
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,959
as interesting as the lack thereof and I

87
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,599
I'm not saying that like you know your

88
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,060
mum says oh yeah uh store brand Coke is

89
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,159
better than actual Coke I actually mean

90
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,959
it you know

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,700
um if we have time towards the end as

92
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,280
well I might go over one particularly oh

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,379
my God what is happening uh one

94
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,720
particularly compelling case uh where

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,400
there isn't actually a rational

96
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,140
explanation at the minute

97
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,000
but there might be one question on your

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
mind at this point as you obviously

99
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,080
 saw who cares why do you care

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,319
right why does it matter surely UFOs are

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,940
just this little like

102
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,120
uh you know meaningless phenomenon we

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,379
can all get a bit of a laugh and a joke

104
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,239
out of seeing a bunch of conspiracy

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
cranks going on about it the US military

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,379
definitely cares

107
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,099
um

108
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,980
it can be the result of a it can cause a

109
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,420
possible national security breach so if

110
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,620
something is flying in their airspace

111
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,360
without permission and can't be

112
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,980
determined that is a breach of security

113
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,560
it's you know fairly obvious right the

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
last thing that the US needs is a

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,739
foreign drone in their backyard as you

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,260
you may remember recently I'll be

117
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,139
talking about that I said I promise you

118
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,760
uh the U.S Department of Defense

119
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,839
recently announced that the

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
establishment of the all domain anomaly

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
resolution office of which the UAP task

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,919
force which is what you see here is a

123
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,120
part I don't know whether that's the

124
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,680
actual logo but I think it is and it

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
looks cool enough so let's go

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
with it right

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,500
um so just a quick note I will be

128
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,120
talking a lot about the US and the US

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,460
government in relation to uaps and this

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,680
is for a couple of reasons so can you

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,020
think of an alien movie or a UFO movie

132
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,780
that has you've ever seen where the US

133
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,820
government is not the either the primary

134
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,220
protagonist or antagonist you probably

135
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,560
can't right

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,040
shut the up

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,300
well who the was that

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,759
um you won't often see you also start me

139
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
off above it you also won't often see

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,900
like the US government sorry the Russian

141
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,400
or Chinese government admit to like a

142
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,960
Cyber attack for example right and it's

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,580
for the same reason why you won't often

144
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,380
hear the Russian or Chinese government

145
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,539
talk about you know incursions in their

146
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,100
airspace because it makes them seem weak

147
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,720
or they think it makes them seem weak

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
right whereas the US uh definitely sort

149
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,160
of disagree on that front

150
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,620
they also have an annual report into UAP

151
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,620
sightings uh that is a fairly recent

152
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,440
thing so like I think 2019 it started

153
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,979
and that's you know something uh that I

154
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,419
think is really positive

155
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,280
uh they also commissioned a thing called

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
Project Blue Book in 1952 which was a

157
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,940
government registry of UFO sightings

158
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,759
that ran up to 1969. I recommend looking

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,259
into that if you're interested in

160
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,220
anything that I'm talking about because

161
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,900
it's pretty cool

162
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,240
so let me give you a little historical

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
example you might have heard of The War

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,520
of the Worlds incident with Orson Wells

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
um so essentially if you haven't heard

166
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,360
of it uh Orson Welles broadcast a radio

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,520
Play version of the book The War of the

168
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,740
Worlds everyone thought it was real

169
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,860
freaked out Panic ensured was awful and

170
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,479
then eventually people figured out it

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,139
wasn't real that happened again in Quito

172
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,699
and Ecuador which is what yeah capital

173
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,380
of Ecuador

174
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,840
um the same thing happened but it got a

175
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,120
little bit more out of hand people found

176
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
out it wasn't real they rioted they

177
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,100
burned the building down and they killed

178
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,539
seven people

179
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,319
oh

180
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,400
my God

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
he's a laughing it's the death

182
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
of seven people Jesus Christ

183
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,979
um the firefighters who were supposed to

184
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,479
be dealing with the fire were off

185
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,340
dealing with the non-existent UFO

186
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,440
reports so

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
I hope that illustrates that it's a

188
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,180
pretty it can be a pretty serious thing

189
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,620
you know the way that disinformation

190
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,300
gets out there

191
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,740
um

192
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,600
oh my God I think I've got recordings

193
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,100
here I shouldn't have done that oh well

194
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,960
so yeah here I'm going to go over a few

195
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
common mistakes that people make when

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
they think that it's a UFO starting with

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
artifacts so these are in camera or

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
around camera effects this artifact here

199
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
is a bulky I'll be going over that in a

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,139
little bit in more detail uh this is a

201
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,960
black it was a black dot it happens when

202
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,000
the sort of lens of the camera gets

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,080
blown out with a little bit too much

204
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,840
light uh normally cheap sorry not lens

205
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,859
the the sensor and the camera

206
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,840
uh uh yeah then there's also lens flares

207
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,280
and that's just like a speck of dust on

208
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,599
the camera

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,300
um astronomic stuff oh my god

210
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,500
um astronomic stuff so anything in space

211
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,080
that's a transient lunar phenomenon so

212
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,060
like I think that's a common impact on

213
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,099
the moon pretty cool stuff not aliens

214
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,259
though uh that is like a bunch of

215
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,060
planets so you've got Venus I think it's

216
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,440
the there's the one on the bottom there

217
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,240
that's fairly common for some reason I

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
don't really know why uh comets and

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,919
asteroids you know

220
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,319
um atmospheric a personal favorite of

221
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,319
mine so this is a iridescent Cloud

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,660
there's a bunch of sort of ice crystals

223
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,039
in the upper Cloud layer reflecting

224
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,900
light in weird ways it can cool effect

225
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,580
that's a Virgo hold don't really know

226
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,960
what causes that but it's pretty cool a

227
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,479
little less lenticular clouds and Saint

228
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,460
Elmo's Fire which is like

229
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,020
that's really cool I recommend you do

230
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
some research on it because yeah that's

231
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,740
great

232
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,240
um

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,139
balloons

234
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,458
but you know my existence

235
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,760
 balloons uh lights uh sort of

236
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,700
been uh projected onto the cloud layer

237
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,440
that's fairly common

238
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,240
um that is a rocket launch which by the

239
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,860
way how cool is that that's

240
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,640
that's a really cool photo and and Elon

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,260
Musk starlink I hate that man

242
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,720
there's also nature Birds there was an

243
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,360
example in Milwaukee recently where um a

244
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
bunch of birds were caught on camera in

245
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,260
like a traffic camera I think and people

246
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,880
thought it was UFO as it wasn't it was

247
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,399
just Birds but with the weird way that

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,300
they were sort of moving they were

249
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,680
leaving a trail because of the exposure

250
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,779
of the camera it was a whole thing uh

251
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,760
seed dispersal and insects they can

252
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,279
often look like UFOs like moving very

253
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,600
erratically on camera and people can

254
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,399
think of their feather away

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,540
so

256
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,080
let me go into a couple of case studies

257
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,940
this is to sort of best apply the kind

258
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,640
of things I go I've just mentioned I'm

259
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,080
going to start with a more recent one

260
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,820
that I've alluded to the

261
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,260
balloons the balloons here we go I'm

262
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,580
going to start talking about this

263
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,399
because it was the only uh balloon

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,260
incident that I had when I started

265
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,060
writing the talk I started writing the

266
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,980
talk before all this happened this was

267
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,660
it wasn't caused by this

268
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,540
and then they shot down a balloon

269
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,100
everyone thought it was a UFO people

270
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,540
were freaking out an alien I should say

271
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,580
so it's a high altitude balloon of

272
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,620
Chinese origin that was spotted and

273
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,360
tracked over both U.S and Canadian

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
airspace that's the sort of General

275
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,420
Route

276
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,760
um before this recent incident Roswell

277
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,260
was probably a balloon for example but

278
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,580
NORAD have recently changed their

279
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,300
filters uh like the um the radar filters

280
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,560
to be able to detect balloons better

281
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,940
which is why there was a massive uptick

282
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,740
in balloon sightings recently that

283
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,440
probably like 15 or 20 a year but this

284
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,540
is just you know it's a fairly common

285
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,920
occurrence where people weren't noticing

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,940
it

287
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,540
um

288
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,580
so if you also look at the shape of the

289
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,680
balloon it's roughly round in shape it's

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,420
white it floats silently these are all

291
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,140
super common like uh reported UFO sort

292
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,899
of sightings as fun additional non-ufo

293
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,240
related factor in case you didn't know

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
um the uh First air-to-air Hill of an

295
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,360
F-22 fighter jet was this balloon ever

296
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,120
in history really keep them safe out

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,540
there boys

298
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,740
um obviously other other incidents have

299
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,360
happened since there's two in Alaska one

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,160
in Yukon one in South America and one in

301
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,839
Romania and Moldova that was probably

302
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,760
the Russians transplant ukrainians and

303
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,620
the balloons got caught of course

304
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,300
um aliens Advanced enough for faster

305
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,560
than light travel probably wouldn't

306
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,240
allow themselves to be shot down by our

307
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
little Sticks and Stones technology I

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,779
just don't think it will happen right

309
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,339
um the prevalence of social media and

310
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,600
the little patent seeking brains we've

311
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
all got in our heads mean that there's

312
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,740
loads of fear-mongering over things with

313
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,660
perfectly rational explanations so with

314
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,880
that said now that I've gone over that

315
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,040
let's talk about some something a little

316
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,959
bit more well that you might not have

317
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,500
heard of right the inverkeything sphere

318
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
uh this is this I got this from a Reddit

319
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,320
post with about 70 upvotes

320
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
um the time the the title of the post is

321
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
the invercating sphere in Scotland

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,740
allegedly not seen with a naked eye when

323
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,140
taken whoa does that mean it's like a

324
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,880
cloaking device it's moving at

325
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,500
significant rate speed across the camera

326
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,279
no so if you look here the Shadows on

327
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
the sort of object there are very

328
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,240
similar to the shadows in the uh in the

329
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,620
foreground and not very similar to the

330
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,880
background so it must mean it's close to

331
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
the camera

332
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,839
um and the like it's also textured which

333
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
isn't common for UFOs but the biggest

334
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,500
giveaway of what it is is it was a dog

335
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,160
right there

336
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,680
I think you can all kind of guess what

337
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,899
it is right it's pretty easy I only

338
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,339
picked this because it's like 55

339
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,839
kilometers south of where we are at the

340
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,100
moment and I think it's a fun little way

341
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,200
to get going

342
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,899
um the next one

343
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,500
so this is a UFO a UFO above the

344
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,380
Sapphire Gentleman's Lounge in uh in Las

345
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,500
Vegas uh the Mojave Desert is a fairly

346
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,740
popular place for UFO enthusiasts uh as

347
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,820
you'll you know you'll know if you've

348
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,339
played Fallout New Vegas or whatever

349
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,839
um so it's showing a bunch of Lights

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
sort of like floating silently above Las

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Vegas uh there's no sort of particular

352
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,079
pattern there uh so what could they be

353
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,000
well

354
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,940
if you look here this image

355
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,579
these lights match pretty closely to the

356
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,320
lights up here right the red light is

357
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
the Hilton that is the Encore and the

358
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,100
wind hotel and that is Trump

359
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,720
International

360
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,959
well that's pretty funny uh yeah

361
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,639
it's it's just it's lights being

362
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,620
reflected from the cloud layer and

363
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,959
because this was taken at a time during

364
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,019
uh an Arctic blast that the US was

365
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,760
experiencing there was loads of ice

366
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,620
crystals in the Iceland because it was

367
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,899
over the desert ice crystals melted

368
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,600
became more reflected that's pretty much

369
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,200
it exactly what happened right

370
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,079
next we've got some lights on the

371
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,700
International Space Station live feed

372
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,800
now I don't know about you but look at

373
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,540
this I would be freaked out if I saw

374
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,360
this right just a bunch of Lights

375
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,120
floating silently

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,320
I don't think you're able to see it in

377
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,360
there but there are also like

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,660
um specks of light seemingly behind the

379
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,600
uh the uh the lights there which kind of

380
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
look like stars so you'd be within your

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,579
right to think that this was like you

382
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,560
know pointing outwards like into space

383
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,800
that's not the case

384
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,459
um

385
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,980
yeah so this was taken a little bit more

386
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,139
recently than the first one uh you can

387
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,700
tell by the arm being in the same

388
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,959
location that this is the same camera

389
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,540
shot it's looking down at Earth that

390
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,240
doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a

391
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,000
UFO uh because the lights could be in

392
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,180
between the ISS and Earth but it does

393
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,620
mean that it's not looking out in Space

394
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,600
the lights behind the camera or behind

395
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,360
the camera were just uh artifacting

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,200
caused by it the camera being exposed to

397
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,360
the elements of space for about 10 years

398
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,980
I think

399
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,639
um

400
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,440
what actually are the lights though well

401
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,519
as you probably as you might have

402
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,079
guessed by the other image in the in the

403
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,639
slide I think it's probably fishing

404
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,500
vessels so there's no lights around

405
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,639
there I think it's probably in

406
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
particular squid fishing vessels because

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
what a lot of squid fishermen do is they

408
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,199
will uh go out at night and shine super

409
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,639
bright lights into the water to make the

410
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,839
to make the squid think that um uh that

411
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,639
the sun is out a lot earlier so they'll

412
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,260
come to the top start feeding at the top

413
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,500
layer and fish more Captain eat them you

414
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,639
know you can debate whether that's good

415
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,620
or not but that's what happens

416
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,720
so the next one this is a really

417
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,459
interesting case that I did a lot of

418
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,459
work on myself so this is a couple of

419
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,860
guys uh just chilling just hanging out

420
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,779
on a volcano in a place called antuko in

421
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,980
Chile

422
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,440
um as you can see they're zooming in on

423
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,240
a little light down in a valley or like

424
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,279
possibly between the camera and the

425
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,600
valley uh yeah

426
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,240
uh the men speaking in the video confirm

427
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
that this is what they think they're

428
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,180
seeing they think they're saying an avni

429
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,940
which is UFO in Spanish yeah

430
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,180
um and I think one of the guys also says

431
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,980
um it could be Goku doing the Genki

432
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,800
Dharma

433
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,959
because Latinos love uh dragon ball man

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
you can't get them away from it

435
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
hmm

436
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,740
so yeah you can see it went a little bit

437
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
triangular there so

438
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,199
I uh went into Google Earth and I was

439
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,940
able to determine that this is the

440
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,100
location that the camera was being uh

441
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,839
like that this was the location the

442
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,699
camera was looking towards you can tell

443
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,380
because there's a sort of geographic

444
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,480
formation here that is identical there

445
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,740
are also mountains off the left and

446
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,560
right this is the place right and so you

447
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,839
can determine from this that the light

448
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,300
is in the valley right oh it's below the

449
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,600
Horizon definitely below the Horizon so

450
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,620
um from that I was able to

451
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,680
uh determine where the

452
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,920
um video was being taken towards this is

453
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,079
a house uh this is a volcano that they

454
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,360
were on and this is a house angled in

455
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
the in such a way that it would be very

456
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,860
reflective because of the sort of tin or

457
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
aluminum roof on the top that's probably

458
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,779
what it is that's probably the source of

459
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,639
the light but why is it triangular in

460
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,720
shape

461
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,820
it's because of the bokeh effect I sort

462
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,160
of alluded to it earlier on so what

463
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,139
happens when

464
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,779
um you have a camera

465
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,140
with like it with a lens that has a

466
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,520
three bladed aperture in it which is the

467
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,780
minimum amount of blades you can have in

468
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,780
an aperture uh there's this Effect

469
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,919
called the boki which is when you're

470
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,939
looking at a object that is emitting

471
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:15,839
light

472
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,179
uh going and is out of focus so that

473
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,160
goes through the lens of the so it goes

474
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,720
through the aperture through the lens of

475
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,579
the camera and it creates this sort of

476
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,099
effect this is the exact same effect on

477
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,959
the right on the left but that's a

478
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,860
little bit more obvious because it's

479
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,840
been staged you can make all sorts of

480
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,040
different shapes of Pokey you can make

481
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,320
like Christmas trees and stuff uh if you

482
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,700
have like a piece of paper that you like

483
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,960
put in front of the lens it's actually

484
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,600
pretty cute maybe you can try it at home

485
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,460
um

486
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,320
so all of the things I've spoken to up

487
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,880
till now have been pretty easily

488
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,400
explainable prosaic phenomena this

489
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,160
though is not uh these videos are not

490
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,440
the same I will be playing these videos

491
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,179
with the sound off because they are very

492
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,299
very very loud but the audio is pretty

493
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,559
important for two of them so if you

494
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
really want to know more about this case

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,460
I would recommend uh searching them up

496
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,360
yourself

497
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,140
so let's start with FLIR

498
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,780
so in 2004 the US Navy carrier strike

499
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,700
group led by the USS Nimitz spotted

500
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,679
targets moving off the off the coast of

501
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
Southern California and Northern Mexico

502
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,400
a pair of fighter jets led by Commander

503
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,020
David fravor approached the targets

504
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,299
identified as dots on the radar that

505
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,820
made erratic movements uh the radar

506
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,320
system on the USS Princeton which was

507
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,059
associated with the carrier strike group

508
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,340
was taken offline and recalibrated but

509
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,020
when it was brought back online the dots

510
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,900
only became sharper so they must be real

511
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,620
physical object oh you would think right

512
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,480
um fravor and Commander D trick

513
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,179
Commander Alex Dietrich uh approached a

514
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,340
white overlooking object hovering above

515
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,559
an ocean disturbance it was described as

516
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
looking like a 50 foot long Tic Tac if

517
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,100
you can think about the think of that

518
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,799
one of the Jets in question was equipped

519
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,940
with an advanced targeting

520
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,100
forward-looking infrared camera or an

521
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,740
app for your camera footage was captured

522
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,299
and named Flair which is the video that

523
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,160
you're looking at at the moment

524
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,440
um highly skilled Pilots testimony and

525
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,059
footage rule out some common aerial

526
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,679
phenomena such as

527
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,960
um you know other Jets or balloons or

528
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
any of these things so at this moment in

529
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,179
time there isn't a rational explanation

530
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,440
supported by all of the available

531
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
evidence as to what you're looking at

532
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,080
the moment

533
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,480
so this is a UFO

534
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,059
whether it's aliens I don't know there's

535
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,160
no way of being able to fully confirm or

536
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,580
deny it but this is a UEFA

537
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,860
um they they actually released in this

538
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,480
sort of group they released three videos

539
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,240
the second one is called go fast it's

540
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,100
one of two more recent videos taken off

541
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,260
the coast of Virginia between 2014 and

542
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,620
2015 uh it was from the USS Theodore

543
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,020
Roosevelt carrier strike group this is

544
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,580
actually one of the easiest three to

545
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,760
identify that this isn't really a UFO so

546
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,559
you can see that from the video that

547
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,480
this video was taken in BLK or black

548
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,539
mode which means that the object oh this

549
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,799
is it's in white mode now but it's

550
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
normally a black note

551
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,700
um the object in question is cold

552
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,880
because if it's in Black mode and the

553
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,620
object is hot it will show up as black

554
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,840
and vice versa right

555
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
um the object appears to be traveling

556
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,780
fast but the Parallax effect uh I don't

557
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,679
know if you know about The Parallax

558
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,600
effect it's like one object traveling

559
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,760
super fast one way another object is

560
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,140
traveling or staying still or traveling

561
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,000
super fast in another Direction looks

562
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
way faster than it actually is you can

563
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,020
figure out uh through some through using

564
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,179
a little bit of maths that um this is

565
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,559
try this is an object traveling at about

566
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,020
40 kilometers per hour it's not as fast

567
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,200
as uh people tend to fit excuse me to

568
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,460
think

569
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,140
um distance to the object can be

570
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,419
determined by on-screen information so

571
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,160
there's this little number here which is

572
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,520
the nautical miles to the Target

573
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,940
um that when I did the maths it was at

574
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,320
3.5 for the 3.6 nautical uh minus the

575
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,360
target the camera was elevated at that

576
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,840
point 33 degrees downwards uh so and the

577
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,000
altitude was ten thousand twenty five

578
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,580
thousand and ten feet so you can do some

579
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,679
little bit of trigonometry and figure

580
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
out that it's approximately 12 000 feet

581
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,640
away from the aircraft and about 13 000

582
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,799
feet from the sea level all evidence

583
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,960
supports this being a piece of debris or

584
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,860
a seabird seabirds often have like cold

585
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,080
outer layers of feathers to like

586
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,059
insulate themselves from the from the

587
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,280
harsh weather that's probably what this

588
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,620
is it's obviously taken a little bit

589
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,360
further away

590
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,460
sort of makes you question

591
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,980
um what training the uh the fighter

592
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,780
pilots get because if they're not able

593
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,179
to identify an object like this as a

594
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,860
seabird like something that's so

595
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,659
obviously you know maybe like a piece of

596
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,100
debris or something then

597
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,720
so it makes you question the other the

598
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,240
other ones but anyway

599
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,460
this is gimbal this is the final video

600
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,860
I'll be going over it's not quite as

601
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,220
clear-cut there is rotation in the

602
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,200
object that you'll see in a moment that

603
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,760
can be accounted for by camera

604
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,679
artifacting things like a lens flare

605
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,900
actually because the assembly that the

606
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,720
app layer camera is mounted to is

607
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,880
um like rotates in such a way as to keep

608
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,700
the object in question at the same sort

609
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,620
of orientation especially relative to

610
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,419
the to the Horizon

611
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,980
um bright light reflecting off of the

612
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,179
glass covering the front of the camera

613
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,039
is probably causing a little bit of uh

614
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,500
of disturbance there

615
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,260
um but that doesn't account for what the

616
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,799
object actually is Mick West who is a

617
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,200
video game developer turned serial

618
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,580
debunker he made um what was that uh

619
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,419
um

620
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,340
Tony Hawkes Pro Skater he was the guy

621
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,840
who made Tony Hawks Pro Skater and now

622
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,059
he's a UFO debunker

623
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:45,780
um

624
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,880
yeah it's crazy life he thinks it's the

625
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,580
exhaust of a jet but

626
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,620
I think Pilots even if I you know

627
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,120
beforehand I was disagreeing with their

628
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,520
assessment that it was a seabird or not

629
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,159
seabird I think Pilots probably are

630
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,659
trained to know whether they're seeing a

631
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,460
jet or not like I don't know maybe

632
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,740
that's just me well like they tend to be

633
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,720
pretty good at figuring that out so I

634
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
don't know this

635
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,539
there are some possible explanations

636
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,280
here but

637
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,419
um

638
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,340
yeah I couldn't tell you really maybe

639
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,780
you've got your own idea come up to me

640
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,500
in the pub afterwards

641
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,480
include I think with the sort of Advent

642
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,299
of the internet and the um you know most

643
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,120
of these videos I got from Reddit uh

644
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
like the

645
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,360
um

646
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,059
what am I trying to say the sort of we

647
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,220
have access to tools to explain UFOs is

648
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,780
easily explainable terrestrial phenomena

649
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,179
but we also have this access to the same

650
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,100
tools to

651
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,600
um

652
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,539
convince ourselves that this is like

653
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,360
alien phenomena the study of UFO

654
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,200
sightings and the search for

655
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,880
extraterrestrial life I think can teach

656
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,159
us a lot about uh the universe and the

657
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,080
world in our place in it even if it's

658
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,860
not

659
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,080
actually aliens because the world that

660
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,880
we live in is beautiful and it's weird

661
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
and strange and all of this research

662
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
that I've been doing has made given me

663
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,460
like a real appreciation for the natural

664
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,220
world and you know for the human uh

665
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,140
created world I think you can really

666
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,500
deepen our understanding and uh help us

667
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,919
appreciate uh the world so

668
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,539
thank you for listening do you have any

669
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,780
questions

670
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,460
uh Sam

671
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,960
yeah uh yeah so you know you you imagine

672
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,559
that these videos

673
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,179
um

674
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,679
they in their like release of these they

675
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:53,880
kind of like

676
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,780
entertain the ideas that this could be

677
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,020
like aliens like little martian fellas

678
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,059
um or are they like you know just to be

679
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,419
clear this is like that was not aliens

680
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,860
uh they what they didn't say like they

681
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,000
tend to keep very tight-lipped about

682
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,980
these kind of things there's a guy I

683
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,120
can't remember his name off the top of

684
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,500
my head but he used to be the head of

685
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,659
the UAP task force or the uh all the

686
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,280
main resolution office

687
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,380
um and he is very sort of

688
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,360
open about the fact that he thinks it's

689
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,840
all aliens he's very Pro UFO

690
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,779
um and obviously he resigned in disgrace

691
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,659
but like the UFO guys really like this

692
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,100
guy because he like confirms their

693
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,380
biases and he did provably work for the

694
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,179
United States government

695
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,080
um

696
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,640
you won't get almost ever the uh like

697
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,679
any government telling you what one of

698
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,179
these objects is one way or another

699
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,659
unless it directly benefits them so it

700
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,460
was beneficial to the United States

701
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,840
government to immediately say that the

702
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,120
balloon was Chinese because that allows

703
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,460
them to control the narrative right it's

704
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,200
not beneficial for them to say it's

705
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,419
aliens in any way because what they're

706
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:01,440
going to do

707
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,419
they think people are going to start to

708
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,340
think like oh yeah the aliens have been

709
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,320
Among Us the whole time or you know

710
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,059
they'll start freaking out yeah exactly

711
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,740
 men in black

712
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,320
so um they haven't said anything I don't

713
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,220
think

714
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,900
uh they will say anything they tend to

715
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,159
be very tight-lipped about this kind of

716
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,000
thing

717
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,940
yeah any more for any more uh I can't

718
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,220
quite say hello Theo

719
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,320
um so there's obviously all these groups

720
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,520
I think

721
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,460
is a real does that anything that

722
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,740
happened

723
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,799
like what in recent times are there

724
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,179
incidents of UFO fanatics doing harmful

725
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,340
things because of evolution

726
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,360
so thankfully not so much there are like

727
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,299
UFO Cults which are you know they were

728
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,039
like a big thing in like the 80s and the

729
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,659
70s they sort of died out a little bit

730
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,919
now

731
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:53,840
um

732
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,299
thankfully as conspiracies go UFO

733
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,460
conspiracies are on the sort of more

734
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,960
tame side because they don't tend to

735
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,240
devolve into anti-Semitism

736
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,559
um

737
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,140
and that's yeah so that there hasn't

738
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,840
really been anything any like

739
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,580
overwhelmingly negative impacts but I

740
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,140
think it's sort of a symptom of a larger

741
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,779
problem of disinformation you know

742
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,659
um so like you start to believe UFOs and

743
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:19,740
you sort of open your mind to the

744
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,779
possibility that the government isn't

745
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,039
always telling you the truth which I

746
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,360
mean that's correct it's not always

747
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,400
telling you the truth but when you sort

748
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
of start to get into that conspiracy

749
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,820
 that can be a more

750
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,240
um like a greater Gateway into Q Anon

751
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,240
and into like in it being an Intel like

752
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,220
Tia was talking about earlier on

753
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,600
um so that's the damage I think it's

754
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,940
causing as opposed to sort of direct

755
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,460
harm because of people's beliefs in UFOs

756
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,159
hello

757
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,700
to get people to stop trying to build

758
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,220
like break into air through them

759
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,340
I didn't think about that

760
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,380
uh yeah in case you didn't hear uh Mal

761
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,419
asked um do I think that they released

762
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,480
the video to stop to get people to stop

763
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,120
trying to break into area 51.

764
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,900
um I think that could be a possibility

765
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,159
because it you know the timing is pretty

766
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
interesting the the first video was

767
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
2004.

768
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,380
maybe who knows

769
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,659
there's all kinds of possibilities

770
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,820
yeah um are we are we good for time can

771
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,440
I take one more question if anyone two

772
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,220
minutes

773
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,419
um I think I'll take one more if that's

774
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,380
okay if anyone has one

775
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,400
that is

776
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,140
one of those ones that I don't have a

777
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,539
rational explanation for like

778
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,940
they definitely happened like if I'm

779
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,740
right Kurt Russell caught one of them in

780
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,440
a plane I think I think he did I think

781
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,240
he was flying like cut the actor Kurt

782
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,400
Russell was flying over Phoenix at the

783
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,799
time and he like actually saw them and

784
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,880
he didn't he's not a UFO guy so

785
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,559
um there's there could be some

786
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,600
atmosphere absolutely like um solution

787
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,400
like rare atmospheric events that happen

788
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,659
because

789
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,020
um there are other sort of atmospheric

790
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,880
things that have happened that we've

791
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,340
only recently first gotten on camera

792
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,799
like 2019 like Sprites I don't know if

793
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,600
you know about that like red flashes of

794
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,460
light that happened like that and you

795
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,899
can't predict them

796
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,399
um so it could be something like that

797
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,440
but I'm gonna be honest with you I don't

798
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,480
have an explanation I think

799
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,520
um because there isn't really video of

800
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,539
it

801
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,658
um

802
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,159
um

803
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
perfect thank you very much
