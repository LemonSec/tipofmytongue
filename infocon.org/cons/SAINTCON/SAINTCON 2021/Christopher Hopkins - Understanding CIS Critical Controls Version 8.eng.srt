1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
um i'm hydroplaned um

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
i remember dc801 the hackerspace in salt

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
lake the group so

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,280
um

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,759
i've been going saintcon as long as pope

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
i haven't accomplished near as much as

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
he's done but we've presented here a few

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,720
times and

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
it's interesting i started out technical

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,119
and now i've become more interested in

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,119
some of the organizational parts of

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,480
security

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
you find eventually that technical

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
organizational problems cannot be solved

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,480
technically

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
so

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,120
talk about our agenda tonight or today

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
um control sets

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
um i probably a lot of you understand

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
what a control set is but in case you're

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
not familiar we're going to go into the

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
the larger idea of a control set

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
then we're going to talk particularly

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,399
about the cis

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
critical security controls

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,640
and then part i'm actually most

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
interested in

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
is our conversation after that

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,880
[Music]

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
you know there's a lot of absolute

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
control sets help you

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
but there are challenges associated with

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
that and i want to have some

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,560
conversation about some of those

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,119
challenges

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
so if we imagine a scenario

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,119
you work for a company

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
and you know the boss someday you're

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
technically smart and

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
interested in a lot of things and

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
someday you realize the need to there's

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
bad things or bad people out there and

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
they need to do something to protect

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
themselves

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
so they come to you

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
and you know we i want you to protect us

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,039
from the bad people

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
and you know if you've not really dug

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
into this is this kind of your first

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,600
exposure if you're pope

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,159
and they say oh yeah pci

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,840
and you know you know that you don't

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
what you don't know is your position

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
right

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
you probably start asking yourself well

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,639
what do i need to do to protect my my

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,640
organization

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
and in 2021 there are a lot of people

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
who have asked that question before

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
and that's where we get there where

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
control sets basically come from

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
we're going to talk about some popular

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
ones

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
um how many and i'll if you raise your

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
hand how many of you work in an

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
organization and you're actually you

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
implemented iso the 27 000 series

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
okay so a few

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
iso 27 000 it's proprietary like you

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
actually have to like pay the company

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
the or the organization that owns it to

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,840
be able to have access to the the

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,200
controls

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
now it's very popular very trusted very

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
un like you know if you are doing

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
business with a company that's in

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
germany

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
and they ask you about what type of

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
controls you say iso you get they nod

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,640
their head they understand what it is

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
and iso is good

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
um you know it does have a lot of

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
controls

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
you know pretty much any need you have

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
you can you can find in iso some type of

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,720
control that you do to implement

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,760
the next another control is uh nist

88
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,920
800-53 who here works for the federal

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
government or a company that does

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,480
business with the federal government

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
okay then you will probably have been at

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
least exposed to nist

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
um the you know the government trying

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
you know it's large organization and

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,640
they established a control set they want

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
to be implemented

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
within the organization

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
um another control

99
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,760
set also for nist which really it's a

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
little different than like the other

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,840
control sets but the nist cyber security

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
framework it's relatively recent

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
is is initially targeted towards

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
critical infrastructure

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
like you think electrical utilities

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
things like this but the thing is the

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,799
reality is

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
it can address other issues other areas

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
how many of you have

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,358
at least looked at nist's cyber security

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,720
framework

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
yeah

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
it's relatively new but actually you

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
know he's gotten a lot of traction

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
then we're going to talk about the one

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
we're talking about today

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
um you'll notice i put the number of

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
controls

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,919
next to some of these and you notice

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,040
that there's only 18 controls

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,440
we're going to talk about why

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,680
we you know why it's so

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
compact compared to some of these other

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
ones

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
uh and some are other ones um

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
there is secure controls framework there

127
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
are like over 800 controls in this

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
secure controls framework

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,039
and there's a few others threats

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
sketch a few others like that

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
so

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,919
there are a lot of answers if you want

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
to find a list

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,759
of things you can do to protect your

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,400
organization there's a lot you can find

136
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,400
now let's talk about the critical

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
security controls

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
it starts in 2008

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,080
sans which i'm how many of you have

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
attended a sans course some point in

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
your career right

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
very popular high quality training

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
very you know

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
they started it

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
in it back in

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
back in 2008

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
you may have heard the term consensus

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,280
audit guidelines

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
kind of a mouthful

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
a lot of people call it the sands top

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,919
20.

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,800
and even today a lot of people

153
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
are thinking it's the sands top 20.

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,199
um

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,840
in 2013 uh they kind of handed it off

156
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
um council on cyber security had it for

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
a bit

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
and then 2015 so about you know six

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,600
years ago it got handed over to center

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
for internet security

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
now throughout this time up until like

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
version 8 which is what we're going to

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,319
talk about it was 20 controls

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
and that was kind of like the the thing

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
everyone understood

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
um this time they've changed they've

167
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
reduced the number of controls

168
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
um

169
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
we'll talk about that

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
so basic ideas ideas that drive why uh

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
the critical security controls are

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
structured the way they are

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
first is everything's written in blood

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
they're neither every single control

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
can they can point to

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
a is something that went wrong that this

177
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
control could have either prevented or

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
mitigated it

179
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
which means you're not like we're not

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
talking about theoreticals like someone

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,199
ca the aliens come from mars

182
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,000
it's all very practical it's all very

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
real world

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
another thing and this is part of why we

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
have a limited amount of controls

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
is

187
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
the focus they're they're

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
they're they cut out they understand in

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
a part of

190
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
their critical security controls is they

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
understand

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
people might have limited resources

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
and you know like what do you do that

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
actually makes a difference

195
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,199
and that's part of why the critical

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
security control is

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
really small compared to some of the

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
other control sets

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,199
feasible

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
very very practical i would say i'm

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
watching we're going to look at some of

202
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
these there's some parts of these

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
controls which i think would still be a

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
challenge for some people

205
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
measurable you're going to you can after

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
reading a control you're going to know

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
if you're there or not

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
they're very easy to evaluate whether

209
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
you're you're meeting the requirement or

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
not

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
a line

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,479
um

213
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
i think yesterday during the third

214
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
vendor security

215
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
class that was the next track they said

216
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,759
there's about 90 percent overlap with

217
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
all the control sets all right that's

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,639
true

219
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
the critical security controls are not

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,599
going to do anything that's radically

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
different than you're going to see in

222
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,280
the other control sets we're just very

223
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,800
focused

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,960
to help you you know not

225
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,879
spend your energy you only have so much

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
energy focus on these things to protect

227
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,799
your organization

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
so the particular the highlights of the

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
changes

230
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,599
in the past who here spent some time

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
with the previous versions of the

232
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
critical security controls

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
okay like fair amount

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,680
so

235
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
in the past they used to say you know

236
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
this is your priority do your basic do

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,959
your foundational do your organizational

238
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
and that that was how you you know

239
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
sequenced your work

240
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,440
they got that's gone

241
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
they entirely got rid of it

242
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
they added implementation groups in

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
version 7 which is the previous major

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
version

245
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
and now they're pretty much the

246
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
implementation groups is going to guide

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
how you implement

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
so

249
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
another thing they've added and this is

250
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,839
the part of this will actually help you

251
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,399
understand how they could get down to 18

252
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
controls from 20 is they added a

253
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
glossary into the current into the

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,200
latest version

255
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
so if you know that critical consumer

256
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
critical security control number one

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
is you know inventory and control your

258
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,880
hardware assets now they don't say

259
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
hardware assets anymore they say

260
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
enterprise assets and because you use a

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
term it kind of covers more you can you

262
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
don't have to say network assets and

263
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
hardware assets there's enterprise

264
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,399
assets

265
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
so that that goes to that consolidated

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,560
some of the controls

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
in the past you had two secure

268
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
configurations you had basically like

269
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
endpoints and net infrastructure now you

270
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
just have

271
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
secure your enterprise assets

272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,560
they got rid of boundary defense

273
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
you know i i think you know there's

274
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
there's been people i think five years

275
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
ago at st khan that said you know your

276
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
perimeter

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,800
doesn't defend you anymore and you know

278
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,680
so

279
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,279
no longer think you know as long as i've

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,920
got my firewall i'm protected

281
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,000
you know that the the world has changed

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
from that

283
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
another thing they've added this year er

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,279
was actually service provider management

285
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
i'm sure everyone's familiar with the uh

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
uh you know the solar winds issue i mean

287
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
probably

288
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
yeah you might know more about than me

289
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,560
but i mean if you're if you whoever you

290
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
work with whoever you share resources

291
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,839
with

292
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
you know their problems can become your

293
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
problems and you adding this control

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
being added is a reflection of that

295
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,719
that makes sense

296
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
and then they've resequenced some things

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,240
it used to be uh i think secure our

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,839
vulnerability management was number

299
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
three now it's like i think number eight

300
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
so let's talk about probably the one the

301
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
one the things that you really need to

302
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
understand to understand the thinking in

303
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,399
version eight

304
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,680
and its implementation groups

305
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
so

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
implementation group one

307
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
the idea here is that you're a small

308
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
business

309
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
you really don't handle anything

310
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
particularly sensitive

311
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
you're you don't you're not going you

312
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,320
may have somebody that's like tech smart

313
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
but you may not even have a dedicated i

314
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,279
t person

315
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,000
and so you know with this in mind

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
you have you know you probably don't

317
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,959
you're not probably not distributed you

318
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
probably

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
the person in your organization can

320
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
stand up from their desk and see all the

321
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
computers that belong to that

322
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
organization or the organization is

323
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
using what i'm trying to do is paint a

324
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,079
picture that we're we're talking small

325
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
company small org

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
now um

327
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
oh and it's probably that fourth item

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
the commercial off the shelf you can

329
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
probably go to best buy

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
and buy all the equipment you need to

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
outfit your your organization

332
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,360
now because of that

333
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
when we got talk about some of the later

334
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,639
controls

335
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
and go into detail

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,399
you notice that like network monitoring

337
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,360
they really can't network monitor

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
effectively with just the you know the

339
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,800
consumer grade equipment

340
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,519
and basically the whole goal of the

341
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,680
controls and implementation group one is

342
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
you're not low hanging fruit

343
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
you're not doing something obvious that

344
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,279
you know if you you know simple things

345
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,079
could have kept from happening

346
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
so that's implementation group one

347
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
now we go to implementation group two

348
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
group two is a big step up

349
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
you know at this point we're assuming

350
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
that you know you actually have like

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
dedicated i.t people like you have a

352
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,120
person and that's what they do for you

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
you know is that

354
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,680
now

355
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
you're also the complexity

356
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,959
you

357
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,519
may have like multiple departments you

358
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
may have

359
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
different leaders in different places

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
i don't think you would i'd honestly say

361
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
implementation group you might consider

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
distributed i know it's the covid world

363
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,800
and distributed is a thing

364
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,519
but i mean that's distributed might be a

365
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
challenge for a group that's like

366
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
implementation group

367
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,120
too

368
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
now

369
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
they might have some regulation

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
regulatory burdens

371
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
but i don't like it there's there's

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,839
going to be when we talk about

373
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
implementation group three

374
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
in that space

375
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,399
the if you do something wrong

376
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
not just your organization is going to

377
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
suffer

378
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,279
and by this point in time you're you're

379
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,079
buying like enterprise equipment for

380
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
your business

381
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,199
now this is an important thing if say

382
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,959
you're you know you're an ig2 group

383
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
organization right

384
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,160
but you're going to start with

385
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
implementation group one which isn't a

386
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,519
bad thing to do i mean you're getting

387
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
off the ground

388
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
please buy enterprise grade equipment

389
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
because if you buy commercial off the

390
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,920
shelf stuff then you're going to turn

391
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,639
around and basically by have to buy

392
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
enterprise equipment

393
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,399
so you know that's a key thing is if

394
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
you're going to kind of like i'm going

395
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
to do one implementation group one then

396
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
i'll do two

397
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,279
make sure you're not wasting your

398
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,639
organization's

399
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,519
money

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
by having to you know and you'll have to

401
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
replace your equipment

402
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
implementation group three

403
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,199
you're actually pretty

404
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,040
industrial at this point and you should

405
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,839
be reasonably

406
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,160
mature you're you're touching some sense

407
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
of information that uh

408
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
let's see here

409
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
uh the

410
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,839
fifth bullet item significant external

411
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
impact associated with successful attack

412
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,279
so say equifax right

413
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,040
if they get attacked there's a

414
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,519
significant impact on people that don't

415
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,959
aren't even customers of the

416
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
organization

417
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
so i'd honestly say that if you are

418
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
touching sensitive information

419
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
i'd say that you know i know some people

420
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
like to minimize their obligations and

421
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
the things they have to do i get it

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
but if you're touching sensitive

423
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,279
information you really honestly should

424
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,240
be implementation group three

425
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
um

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
and by this point in time

427
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
you really you're like you might

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
not say you can protect against zero

429
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,720
days but you should be able to mitigate

430
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,160
or control the impact associated with

431
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,079
something like that

432
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,959
so

433
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
implementation group three

434
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,279
is all the other implementation groups

435
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,440
plus 23. now these 23 controls

436
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,199
they might you know they not all

437
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,079
controls are created equal

438
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
these 23 actually require significant

439
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
organizational

440
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,040
technical resources to make to realize

441
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
so even though you may 23

442
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,600
trust me the 23 has some significance so

443
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,199
we're going to look at some details

444
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,800
we're not going to look at every

445
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
safeguard

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,199
because

447
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,440
we don't have that kind of time

448
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,920
but i'm going to point out some key ones

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
ones that are probably going to be a

450
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
challenge that you're going to have to

451
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
figure out

452
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,839
and by the way this the url the cis

453
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,600
actually whenever someone talks about

454
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
cis they want someone to give a link

455
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
to the source documentation so if you

456
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,280
want to go back

457
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,799
but that that's this link here

458
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
so here are the controls if you're

459
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
familiar with previous versions one and

460
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,319
two really is no change

461
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
data protection moves up

462
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
secure configuration moves up

463
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,119
they kind of reorganize some of the

464
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,280
controls like account and access control

465
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
which always kind of go together

466
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
vulnerability management actually drops

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
down from the previous version

468
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,120
you have some familiar controls

469
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
and then i'd say actually the one that's

470
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,679
kind of new is service provider

471
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
management

472
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,919
so with that in mind let's look at the

473
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,520
different controls again we're not going

474
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
to look at every safeguard each line

475
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,720
here is a safeguard so you have control

476
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
and then safeguards underneath it right

477
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
so you know like only two for

478
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,080
implementation group one

479
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
and you even if you had like no

480
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,799
enterprise resources you should be able

481
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
to execute it now that being said you

482
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
even if your implementation group one

483
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
you may actually want

484
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
to go enterprise on some things because

485
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
you'll you'll help you cope and you're

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
expecting to grow at some point right

487
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
so

488
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
no nothing shoot too much here

489
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
implementation or uh control 2 is

490
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,919
interesting

491
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
you know i look at the ones and you nod

492
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
your head but when you get down to those

493
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
bottom three

494
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
authorized software okay

495
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
there's controls for that

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
authorized libraries

497
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
i know a lot of people that that that

498
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
would be a big challenge

499
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,039
and that's implementation group two

500
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,799
and then implementation you know the

501
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
very last one which ig threes even

502
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
scripts you control scripts on your

503
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
systems

504
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
those three

505
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
you know they're not they're doable

506
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
but the thing is

507
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,400
you know you're going to have to have

508
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
pretty strong control of your

509
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
environment which is not a bad thing

510
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
but a lot of people coming from

511
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
organizations that are trying to up

512
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,760
their game this will be a challenge

513
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,240
and they i might ask you right now is

514
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,600
anyone like

515
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,880
would would say let's go with 2.6 the

516
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
authorized libraries who here in your

517
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
organizations would struggle to get that

518
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,200
implementation of that control in

519
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
a lot of people thank you

520
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
yeah yeah the quite you know statement

521
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
was you know even if you did how many

522
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
examples of hijacked libraries are there

523
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,679
yeah

524
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,280
yeah yeah

525
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
yeah i mean you would probably need some

526
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
type of hashing or signature work so the

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
thing about that's some work and you

528
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,720
know i'm calling out these things

529
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
because you know like some a lot of

530
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,039
stuff yeah i got it this i'm gonna have

531
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,760
to work for it

532
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
data protection

533
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
again a lot of this reads like can make

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
sense honestly i'd say that more than

535
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
technical

536
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
uh that organizational challenges exist

537
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
in protecting your data

538
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,840
like you know like a lot of these things

539
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
they say you should label your data

540
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
based on sensitivity

541
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
but who here you know works in an

542
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
organization that should but doesn't

543
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,799
label your data based on its sensitivity

544
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
thank you for being honest appreciate

545
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,559
that

546
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
but hey i yeah and i would i've been

547
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
okay if you didn't but yeah it's

548
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,320
i'm pretty sure you are not alone

549
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,039
um it's yeah it's a challenge because

550
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
you know to a certain extent it requires

551
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
a certain amount of rigor

552
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,760
that sometimes workplaces and cultural

553
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
interests may try to avoid

554
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,320
when we continue

555
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
if you look at

556
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,480
you know data flow diagrams

557
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,039
you know how many of you have ever

558
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
spent and spent any time in your career

559
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
developing software

560
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
how many of you like maybe in college

561
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
got like you had a class where they

562
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,840
taught you about data flow diagrams

563
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
okay there you go

564
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
how many of you who wrote code and did

565
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
have a class on data flow diagrams

566
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
actually produce data flow diagrams when

567
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,280
you're developing software

568
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,320
okay

569
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,280
one

570
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,039
right

571
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,960
yeah you know because to a certain

572
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
extent a developer kind of used their

573
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
mind their job is to

574
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,360
write a write code and this is kind of a

575
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,799
distraction

576
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
but i mean more mature organizations

577
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
where you have to understand where your

578
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
sense of data is going and coming

579
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
you know this type of thing allows

580
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
people to understand and therefore

581
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
protect their data

582
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,240
and encrypt data and transit at rest pre

583
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,559
normal

584
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,679
you know the interesting thing is a log

585
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,000
sensitive data access

586
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
and in 2013

587
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,360
there was the snowden leaks right

588
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
and nsa and the big story of the year

589
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,120
basically

590
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
and i'm curious i mean i'm hoping that

591
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
nsa logged access to their sensitive

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,039
data i'm just curious if they did have

593
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,400
that in place

594
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
what they saw was being accessed

595
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,799
i bet it was really uncomfortable to say

596
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,600
okay secure configuration next

597
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,120
a lot of this

598
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
you know you're gonna nod your head and

599
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
yeah you know

600
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
you're when you get to the the

601
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
implementation group two and three

602
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
you're going to uh

603
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,039
you talk about say for example um have

604
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,480
remote wipe on on a portable user and

605
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
user devices how many of you in your

606
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,960
organization should have mdm but don't

607
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
okay a few honest people

608
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
again thank you

609
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,159
[Music]

610
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,039
and that the thing is you know it's it's

611
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
not just for security

612
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,280
i'm pretty sure your id part it

613
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
department is working twice as hard as

614
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
they should

615
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
uh because they don't have it right

616
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
uh means no a lot of things are good for

617
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
security are also good for your it

618
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
department that's one example of that

619
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
but basically last three controls if you

620
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
don't have endpoint management

621
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,200
good luck

622
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,720
and

623
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
i met an i.t manager once we had a

624
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,799
argument

625
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,159
over they need to we need to have it

626
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,159
endpoint management and they're like oh

627
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
no no no and eventually they came around

628
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
to me but you know it's like you know

629
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
i'm i'm trying i was trying to help him

630
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,559
but yes endpoint management if you don't

631
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,679
have it

632
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
please please look into it

633
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,279
besides security especially how many of

634
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
you in this covid have your

635
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
organization's gone remote or

636
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,240
distributed heavily

637
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,159
a lot of people right

638
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,159
and again endpoint management you may a

639
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,720
mobile device manage same thing

640
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
this this will help you secure your

641
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
organization and service your

642
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
organization

643
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
account management

644
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
basic

645
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,039
stuff here

646
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,799
you notice that implementation group one

647
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
we're not asking them to centralize it

648
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
again we're assuming they're small

649
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
and not distributed because the moment

650
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,400
that you're distributed or big

651
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
not centralizing account management

652
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,240
is a nightmare how many of you have ever

653
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,559
been a case where you didn't have

654
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
centralized account management and it

655
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,520
was very frustrating

656
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
okay

657
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
yeah

658
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
so

659
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,840
access control very close to account

660
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,279
management

661
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,640
um

662
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
you know centralized access control

663
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
how i'll ask the positive question in

664
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
this case how many of you have

665
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
some type of system that basically like

666
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,200
a single sign-on

667
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
within your organization that most of

668
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
your services not say all but most of

669
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,520
your services use

670
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
yeah

671
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,440
that is infinitely better position to be

672
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
in

673
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
than not to have that because say you

674
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
have an employee that leaves under not

675
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
good circumstances

676
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,440
with centralized account management

677
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,880
turn them off

678
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
and not saying you have no problems but

679
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,000
your problems are reasonably controlled

680
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,039
if you

681
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,520
don't have that then you have your it

682
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
and your

683
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
assist admins spending the next two

684
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
hours

685
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
trying to find everything and turn them

686
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200
off

687
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,279
yeah

688
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,320
and define role-based access control

689
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,559
this is that probably the truth of the

690
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,360
matter for a role-based access control

691
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,159
is a harder organizational lift

692
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
than it is a technical lift

693
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,279
because a lot of organizations

694
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
especially small ones

695
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
almost they want can they play hero

696
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,720
like in the soccer game you know the

697
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,039
kids soccer game how everyone just

698
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
chases the ball around and nobody plays

699
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
any of their positions

700
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,279
yeah you know what i'm talking about

701
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
right

702
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
what happens is

703
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,440
they kind of like that they like heroes

704
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
because they're young and

705
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,640
net eventually it ends up hurting you

706
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,559
eventually you have to kind of have

707
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,840
different people play different

708
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,799
positions and control access based on

709
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,679
that

710
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
and i honestly

711
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
you think oh that we can implement a

712
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,039
technical solution

713
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
you need to get the organizational part

714
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
you need to spend some time with your hr

715
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,440
and your business leadership and

716
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,880
help them understand this

717
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
continuous vulnerability management this

718
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,600
used to be number three bumped down not

719
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
that it's not important but some things

720
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,000
got in front

721
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
a lot of this is going to sound pretty

722
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,880
straightforward

723
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,480
number eight audit logs

724
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,640
now notice i actually one interesting

725
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,559
about this is like initially for

726
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,399
implementation group one you're not

727
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,360
trying to centralize audit logs like

728
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
we're not asking you to do that again we

729
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,919
want this to be achievable by the

730
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
organization and understanding they're

731
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
limited on expertise and resources as

732
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,960
long as you have logging turned on

733
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,559
we'll call that good

734
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
one thing about it is also they're not

735
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,159
expecting to deal with sensitive

736
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
information so it's while it's important

737
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,799
to have this turned on it's not so

738
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,600
critical that we pull it all together

739
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,840
and use a seam and things like this

740
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,640
now one a very interesting thing because

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
a lot of the things you'll look at here

742
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,720
and make sense like maybe you know the

743
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,200
command line audit logs might make you a

744
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
little uncomfortable

745
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
but the last control which is

746
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
implementation group three is service

747
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
provider so like who here maybe uses

748
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
octa my organization does

749
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,360
okay if you it's it's good solution

750
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,640
uh you can if you integrate with doctor

751
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,760
have them send their data into your

752
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
scene

753
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
and even though like a lot of this is

754
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
have all your data go to the seam when

755
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
you get to that really mature

756
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,159
organization we even want to try to pull

757
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,080
data from our partners into the scene

758
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,120
which is a different challenge than the

759
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,479
uh than doing the other work

760
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
email and web browser protections

761
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
i think a lot of this makes sense

762
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,039
the last one where it says deploy

763
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,279
maintain email server anti-malware

764
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
protections

765
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,159
that

766
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
type of thing basically

767
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,480
how many of you have an email sandbox in

768
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,720
your organization or know what an email

769
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
sandbox is

770
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,279
okay

771
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,679
the idea is that your email like

772
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,279
attachments will actually be opened up

773
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,840
in a virtualized environment handled or

774
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
manipulated and be assessed for maybe

775
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,360
the risk it proposes to your

776
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,640
organization

777
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,360
this type of resource is you can

778
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
third parties will provide it for you

779
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
but this is what they're talking about

780
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
with that type of control

781
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,679
malware defenses the one i would find

782
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,840
very interesting is 10.5 enable

783
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,880
anti-exploitation features everyone

784
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,279
knows av and everything

785
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
a lot of your systems

786
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,240
are not by default hardened as they

787
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
could be

788
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
another thing from the center for

789
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,279
internet

790
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,840
security they have benchmarks

791
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
how many of you have ever heard of us

792
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
dig

793
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
you probably touched the military at

794
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,520
some point or something anyways it's a

795
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
baseline like things you can do

796
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,480
to

797
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
enable or disable features to make your

798
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
systems more secure

799
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,919
when your 10.5 is kind of talking about

800
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,880
that

801
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,159
things like say address space location

802
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
randomization

803
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
and things that help your systems maybe

804
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,799
not get hit by a buffer overflow attack

805
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,399
things like that

806
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,000
but i would say

807
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
this control looks like i just need to

808
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,520
run av

809
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
it's also let's harden your systems

810
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,320
data recovery this is a very interesting

811
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,480
one this sense that implementation group

812
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
one has to do pretty much everything

813
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
that the other group has with the exact

814
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,279
exception we're not going to expect you

815
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,919
to test it

816
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,240
network infrastructure management again

817
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
for them they're commercial off the cell

818
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,679
for implementation group one so all

819
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,679
we're asking them is keep your stuff up

820
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
to date that's it all the all the extra

821
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,840
work which

822
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
you know seems pretty

823
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,080
um there and then we go to implement uh

824
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,000
monitoring and you notice that we don't

825
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,240
expect implementation group one to do

826
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,399
any network monitoring but we're

827
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,440
assuming they're on commercial on a

828
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,080
consumer grade equipment so

829
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,000
you know it'd be asking them to do

830
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
something

831
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
and they don't touch sensitive or at

832
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,880
least i hope they aren't

833
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,320
and then there's more one thing you're

834
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
going to notice and go back here

835
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
in implementation group 2

836
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
you have a lot of

837
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,799
intrusion detection

838
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,640
but when you go to implementation group

839
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
3 they're talking about intrusion

840
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,159
prevention

841
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,080
so you actually have active

842
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,559
controls in place protecting you not

843
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
just something bad happened but protect

844
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,399
you from something that went bad

845
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,679
security awareness training

846
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,120
um

847
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
you know lucky honestly the human

848
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,840
we need humans to get things done and

849
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,600
the problem is that

850
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,120
humans the the attackers know

851
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
that humans

852
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,440
are

853
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
our risk to our organization now they

854
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,840
can also be very good they can be great

855
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,919
sensors but they can also they're

856
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,880
probably the most targeted

857
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,159
part of your

858
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,919
organization so all the training

859
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,919
and the only thing that they were not

860
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,720
expecting like less mature organizations

861
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,519
to do

862
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,480
is have

863
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
role specific

864
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,720
uh security training now an example what

865
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,200
you might actually encounter in this

866
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
space is how many of you work at a

867
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,519
company organization that has like point

868
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
of sale where you have consumers come up

869
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,440
and they swipe cards

870
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,559
okay not too many okay

871
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,360
but you a pci actually wants you to

872
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
train those people to inspect the

873
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,640
devices like daily for skimmers things

874
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,760
like that

875
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,919
so that would be an example of a

876
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,840
particular security awareness training

877
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,679
you'd have for certain people in certain

878
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,080
roles

879
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
service provider management this is a

880
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
new control

881
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,640
and if you're implementation group one

882
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,200
all you do is just get have a list let's

883
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,679
at least you need to know who you're who

884
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,240
your service providers are

885
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,600
now

886
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
if you get to a point and you're dealing

887
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,679
with sensitive information now you're

888
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
actually like assessing them and paying

889
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
attention like every year audits how

890
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,399
many of you have third parties that

891
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,600
almost on an annual basis will have you

892
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
fill out maybe a survey and do

893
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,279
have someone come on site

894
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,480
i expect that's going to increase

895
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
but you know like the risk associated

896
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,199
with a lot of that

897
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,960
now notice for application software

898
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,760
security which is interesting here

899
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,199
is that

900
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
they you know kind of the assumption

901
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,359
that if you're a very small

902
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,440
organization you're not doing any

903
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
in-house software development

904
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
now i know some small organization how

905
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,839
many you actually work for a small

906
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,000
organization like say 10 and you

907
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,679
actually had some software development

908
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
in in that organization

909
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
it happens right

910
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,760
yeah but i mean this model we're

911
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,199
assuming that you know like if you at

912
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,639
the point that you're

913
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
writing software you're at least

914
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
implementation group too

915
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,960
so i know some people would probably

916
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,079
want to be

917
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,199
well we'll just worry about

918
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,760
implementation group one we're small

919
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
well

920
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,320
once you start

921
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,560
going into a certain space

922
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,079
the expectations go up

923
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,290
so

924
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,040
[Music]

925
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
now one name

926
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
the thing interesting thing is to say

927
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,040
here is implement code level security

928
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
checks

929
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,839
so things like static software

930
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
static application security testing how

931
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,720
many of you actually have

932
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
a software development in your

933
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
organization and you're doing static

934
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,680
application security testing

935
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,599
good

936
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,839
and you know like dynamic application

937
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,520
security testing

938
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,000
both these the type of testing

939
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
um you know you should have somebody

940
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
kick the tires

941
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,200
and you'll see where things fail you'd

942
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,520
rather have someone that works for you

943
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,040
do it than someone that didn't

944
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
instant response this is interesting

945
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
because in the past before

946
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
implementation groups you would have

947
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,359
actually told a small company don't

948
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,560
worry about

949
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,280
in incident response but even

950
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
implementation group one has some

951
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
incident response

952
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,520
or obligations now it's basically like

953
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,359
we'll identify we know who we need to

954
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,079
talk to and we tell our people to report

955
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
things it's that's not

956
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
heavy

957
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
um

958
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,680
but

959
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,079
you know later on especially when you're

960
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,839
complex especially when you have

961
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,960
sensitive information instant response

962
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,119
becomes you know a thing that you have

963
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,599
to have

964
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,400
and the last control that we only have

965
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
18 controls now

966
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
not 20.

967
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,079
last one is the same one you've seen

968
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,440
before

969
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,839
and basically pen test

970
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,040
and

971
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,720
you know a the thing about this is

972
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,480
if when you once you reach a certain

973
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
level of maturity once you your

974
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,079
organization has the potential for a

975
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,160
certain type of risk

976
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,000
then we have to deal

977
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
with you know we have to have pen

978
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,079
testing because you're always being pen

979
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,920
tested it's just whether or not they

980
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,040
work for you right

981
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
so with that in mind this is the part

982
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
i'm most interested in there's some

983
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,119
issues i want to bring up

984
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,560
because i want

985
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,240
because this is a challenge when i've

986
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,960
looked at this and been in places i've

987
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
seen challenges in the space so like

988
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,920
which implementation group matches your

989
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,839
organization

990
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,599
the challenge i've seen here and

991
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,400
actually we have a mic available if you

992
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
people want to comment on this issue is

993
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,200
your organization has limited resources

994
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
or that at least they have a preference

995
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,240
for you utilizing limited resources for

996
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
security

997
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,280
but

998
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
they are actually

999
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
really should be like an implementation

1000
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,520
group three when you assess that the

1001
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
sensitivity of what they're doing the

1002
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
complexity they're distributed

1003
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
everything is telling you

1004
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,880
they should be implementation group

1005
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
three right

1006
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
but you know you're talking to your

1007
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
leadership

1008
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,599
and they they say well we think we're

1009
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,640
implementation group one

1010
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
you know that's a challenge who here has

1011
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,680
had that type of challenge you know when

1012
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,040
when we're working within your

1013
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,359
organizations

1014
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,960
okay a few of you

1015
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,920
yeah

1016
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,240
and you know that's honestly more than

1017
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
technical challenges that's can be one

1018
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,920
of the bigger challenges that you'll

1019
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,359
have

1020
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,960
one thing i've learned

1021
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,440
and what i'm in the process of working

1022
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
through is this

1023
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
get buy in whatever you're going to do

1024
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
for security

1025
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,880
make sure that before you really push

1026
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
within your organization you get that

1027
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,400
whatever senior most element in your

1028
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,200
organization and have them like agree

1029
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,160
and like sign off and policy it and you

1030
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
know because if you don't

1031
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
you will find that once you start

1032
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
pushing and it becomes uncomfortable in

1033
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
some ways for some people

1034
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,240
that you'll lose

1035
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,520
but if you've

1036
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,440
got organizational buy-in leadership

1037
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,640
buy-in

1038
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,280
you're in a lot better position once you

1039
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,839
encounter those situations

1040
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,119
um okay this is how many of you

1041
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,480
you've gone along you're getting some

1042
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,560
stuff done but you come up on a control

1043
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,520
and

1044
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
you just know your organization's going

1045
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,160
to struggle with it

1046
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
yeah there probably should be more hands

1047
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
off for that but thank you for those who

1048
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
did

1049
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
yeah thank you

1050
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
um

1051
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
you know this is going to happen

1052
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,560
and here's an important thing to

1053
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,079
understand

1054
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,280
is that

1055
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
the you know like there can be besides

1056
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,680
security there can be other things that

1057
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,320
could end their organization if they

1058
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,240
don't make money if they're they don't

1059
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,320
have money at the end if they have more

1060
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
month at the end of their money

1061
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,640
and they have obligations

1062
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
and you know like payroll to pay and all

1063
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,680
this

1064
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,400
they may be willing to accept a security

1065
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,359
gap

1066
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,520
because they you know they you know with

1067
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,560
the resources being what they are

1068
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
at that point i mean i know we don't

1069
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,680
like gaps we're at a security conference

1070
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,240
but like as long as your job

1071
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,079
you can be comfortable as long as they

1072
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,800
are fully informed and they understand

1073
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
the risk they're accepting

1074
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,119
at that point you know

1075
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,520
they they accept the risk

1076
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
and the gap you know make sure kind of

1077
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,040
get them on the hook make sure they kind

1078
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,440
of put in writing but we understand and

1079
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,079
we're we're choosing not to do the thing

1080
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,040
right now

1081
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,960
just because they say no now doesn't

1082
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,119
mean it's no forever

1083
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,680
you can reapproach it maybe some news

1084
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,319
story opens that door maybe they get you

1085
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,240
know they're willing to go ahead and do

1086
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,319
it now

1087
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,079
what should you do first second third

1088
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,440
and fourth right because there's a lot

1089
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,800
even

1090
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,119
the critical security controls which are

1091
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,839
really trying to compact things

1092
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,480
is still a lot

1093
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,400
what i'd say is you know once you've

1094
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,359
identified your implementation group

1095
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,000
go if all trust the sequence that this

1096
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,079
the controls are put in

1097
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,319
that that is an approach

1098
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,480
where you can manage it you're not

1099
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
trying to do too much all at once and

1100
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,839
can't get anything done

1101
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,319
an interesting thing a thing that may

1102
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,280
inter

1103
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,839
incentivize your businesses

1104
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,640
is

1105
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,760
this year

1106
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,560
the state legislature passed a law

1107
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,640
that basically said that if you

1108
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
if you're following like best practices

1109
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,520
and they actually call out the cis

1110
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,359
critical security controls as one of

1111
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,480
those

1112
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,079
what if you have a

1113
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,319
information security incident

1114
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,359
that's going to

1115
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,200
help protect your organization from

1116
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,000
certain types of legal risk

1117
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
which is good

1118
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,000
because a concern is

1119
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
you know you're if you spend resources

1120
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,079
you kind of want to get value out of

1121
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,160
that and they're basically trying to

1122
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,040
carve out and say because you do good

1123
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,079
things

1124
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
we're going to treat you a little

1125
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,119
different it's weird because when you

1126
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,200
have a security incident a lot of times

1127
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,680
you're the victim of a crime

1128
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,440
but how often do you feel like you

1129
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,839
actually somehow committed a crime when

1130
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,160
someone you know compromises your

1131
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,680
organization

1132
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,440
you know it's it's inverted so they're

1133
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
trying to

1134
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,079
shelter it so if you want to sell to

1135
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,160
your organization hey it's critical

1136
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,880
security controls

1137
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,359
you know we want to we want to you know

1138
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,480
do this and it will help our

1139
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
organization

1140
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,319
you might pull this one up

1141
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,480
and we're about

1142
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,200
seven minutes before i'm at the end i

1143
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
want to open this up are there concerns

1144
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,599
or questions or even comments that

1145
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,920
someone wants to make on the topic that

1146
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
we've been discussing i know it's all

1147
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,280
been me

1148
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,560
if you want to raise your hands i think

1149
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,839
we have a mic available

1150
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,200
okay please over he's over here

1151
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,560
okay i'll repeat it for the recording

1152
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,800
i'll just kind of summarize what you

1153
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
said is you know there's a lot of work

1154
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,720
that goes on but really management

1155
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,040
doesn't see it and doesn't really like

1156
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
see the the

1157
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
significance associated with that is

1158
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,400
that a good summary

1159
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
and you know the the thing about the

1160
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,560
interesting thing is like i t

1161
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,280
as long as all the computers are working

1162
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,440
you know like they're almost invisible

1163
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,280
but the moment it breaks down you're

1164
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,920
you're screaming for rit right

1165
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,760
um you know there's a

1166
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,880
security company um that has is one of

1167
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,079
their slogans is we make nothing happen

1168
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,960
which kind of speaks to your point there

1169
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,359
and you know so you have to you know you

1170
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,200
have to communicate value

1171
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,960
like you if you're a technician all you

1172
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,200
have to worry about is like conducting

1173
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,680
vuln scans remaining vulnerabilities pen

1174
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,960
tests you know network auditing but if

1175
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
you're in leadership in information

1176
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,079
security

1177
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,400
a big part of your job is helping

1178
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,960
explain the value and significance and

1179
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,640
it's not an easy job

1180
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,319
for what you just said

1181
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
it is challenges anyone have

1182
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,040
things they've done that maybe helped

1183
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,839
address that

1184
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,920
so we

1185
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,200
we work in a heavily regulated financial

1186
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,319
industry

1187
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,760
um

1188
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,280
and

1189
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,200
one of the challenges

1190
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
you know i shot both of my hands up

1191
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,760
there when you said have you ever

1192
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,200
struggled implementing any of these

1193
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,560
controls you know

1194
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
justifying it to the business

1195
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,920
um we're

1196
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,000
we're on path just this in this next

1197
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,640
quarter to finally implement a cmdb for

1198
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,119
for for 1-1

1199
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,400
and i think

1200
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
where

1201
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,599
we found the leverage and the way to

1202
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,200
influence those managers and those

1203
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,400
executives

1204
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,920
is in the metrics

1205
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
that the information security team and

1206
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,240
the the operational teams can gather on

1207
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
the control on the controls that they

1208
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,280
implement

1209
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
so as as we started gathering and

1210
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,359
implementing a control assurance program

1211
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,880
into our security

1212
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
program of the bank

1213
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,359
we're able to reach out and say okay you

1214
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,960
know this control and this control and

1215
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,560
this control we have api connections

1216
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,920
into all of them and we can pull all the

1217
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,240
asset information down and we can say

1218
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,280
you know comparatively we should have

1219
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,119
x number of assets but we're only seeing

1220
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,960
half of that in this control and we're

1221
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,480
only seeing three quarters of that in

1222
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,839
this control and we're only seeing this

1223
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,079
and this and so our control assurance

1224
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,000
metrics that we were reporting up to the

1225
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,440
management teams

1226
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,520
were abysmal

1227
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,440
and

1228
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,880
when we

1229
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,599
showed how little of coverage our

1230
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,920
controls actually were and how much

1231
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,760
money they were investing

1232
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,520
in these controls

1233
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,440
they were seeing that their roi wasn't

1234
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,800
being met

1235
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,520
and thus the push to now centralize all

1236
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,960
of our assets

1237
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,599
from all these controls into a cmdb

1238
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,680
so think about how you can tailor your

1239
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,359
metrics to show that they're just

1240
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,760
wasting money by checking a box to say

1241
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,880
we're secure

1242
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,200
appreciate that i appreciate it you have

1243
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
to speak business to business people

1244
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,680
right and metrics yeah

1245
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,200
and that's the thing please say there's

1246
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,720
more comments out there please

1247
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
and we're about three minutes i want to

1248
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,119
give the next person that's coming in

1249
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,359
behind us a chance so

1250
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,079
there's

1251
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,079
one or two more and then we'll go okay

1252
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,480
just real quick is there a prioritized

1253
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,760
approach

1254
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,960
or

1255
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,920
some

1256
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,160
risk ranking associated with each of the

1257
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
results you know when you

1258
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,559
so the priority they they that's what

1259
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,280
they

1260
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,920
they sequenced these like the sequence

1261
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,000
of these controls they really should do

1262
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,880
inventory first uh you know

1263
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,359
and do these they want you to follow the

1264
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,319
sequence within your your implementation

1265
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,160
group that's the guidance there that's

1266
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,319
being given generally this is very

1267
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,640
generally your specific situation

1268
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,440
may

1269
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,359
cause you might have reason to change

1270
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,640
some of the sequencing does that help

1271
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,119
and one more and then we we

1272
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,839
gonna need to go

1273
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,599
yeah so this is kind of more back to the

1274
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,760
question of how you make management um

1275
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,200
you know aware of what they need to do

1276
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,440
and prioritize things

1277
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,280
um

1278
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,200
never waste a good incident i guess is a

1279
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,559
good way to put it

1280
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,359
um

1281
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,240
the unfortunate reality is is that

1282
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,000
typically when you're when you're up at

1283
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,760
midnight two in the morning trying to

1284
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,000
decide where ownerships of assets are

1285
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,800
and

1286
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,640
what data is on there that

1287
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,920
management center realizes oh yeah we

1288
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,760
got to get some of this uh some of this

1289
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,240
in place so yeah

1290
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
good i like that that's really good use

1291
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
you should not have a traumatic event

1292
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,880
that you don't leverage to make your

1293
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,839
situation better right

1294
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,880
all right one last slide and then

1295
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,960
which is let me get down to it

1296
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,359
is i want the conversation to continue

1297
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,240
so on a st con discord server there's a

1298
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,640
channel cis controls

1299
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,520
and what i do is every day i put one

1300
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,400
safeguard

1301
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,720
in there or like if we're reaching a new

1302
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,680
control i'll go with the control and the

1303
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,760
benefit is we're able to look at each

1304
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,559
one of these controls and safeguards in

1305
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,559
isolation which helps you kind of have a

1306
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,520
discussion on something very focused

1307
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,920
so if you are interested this is

1308
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,160
increased your interest in this area

1309
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,880
please get on this st con discord

1310
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
channel

1311
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,880
discord and then cis controls channel

1312
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
and follow along and contribute make

1313
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
your comments things you're struggling

1314
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,040
with things you found at work

1315
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,520
both are welcome interests so

1316
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,640
with that thank you for your time and

1317
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,210
have a good since
