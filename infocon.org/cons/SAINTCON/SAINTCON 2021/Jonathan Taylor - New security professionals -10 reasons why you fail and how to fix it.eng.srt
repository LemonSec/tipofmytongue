1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
uh my name is jonathan taylor

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,720
and uh this is

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,040
ten reasons why you fail

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
as a new security professional

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,599
and how to fix it

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,360
now this is a expose on me

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
what you're seeing here are all the

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
things that i did to screw up my career

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
over the past 24 years 23 years

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
something like that

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,720
and

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
ways that perhaps you can avoid some of

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
the mistakes that i made if that's one

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,560
thing i can do to help that's what i'd

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,039
like to do

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,920
i'm going to have some

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,879
i'm going to have some polls during the

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,559
meeting where i'd love to get your

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
feedback on these because they help

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
make the point that i'm trying to make

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,399
as part of the presentation so if you

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,559
grab your smartphone and you scan that

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,160
barcode it should work if you do it from

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,039
up here

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,840
that'll get you to the where it's at

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,199
and when it comes to that point in the

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,280
slide it'll activate that particular

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,199
survey and you can answer it

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
as it comes up

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
all right first off a little bit about

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
me let me get this out of my

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
noise range here

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360

family

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,040
science there's an interesting story

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,320
there that if there's time at the end

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
i'll i'll tell about that one

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
i have been a cyber security professor

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
i'm an incurable electronics tinkerer

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
i'm not very good at any of these things

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,318
but i like to think that i am and i

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
certainly keep trying because that's

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
what hacking is all about you keep

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
trying until you get a little bit better

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,879
at it

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,040
many years ago one day i sat down at

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,760
some tables at the alexis park during

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
defcon 9

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
and the guy next to me says hey you want

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
to play

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
i said play what

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
and he says hacker capture the flag

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
i said okay

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,840
seems like a fun thing to do that'd be

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,400
great well

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,880
we did okay

74
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,540
[Laughter]

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
we did okay we came back again the next

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
year thinking it was just a fluke and we

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,120
won a second time

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
so i was team co-captain the second year

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
uh digital revelation nah did druv for

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
short

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,800
those are fun times

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,760
so this presentation is meant for

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
uh for this type of person this is

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
really the target this is the person

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
that i was when i started out in

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
security

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
security comes naturally to you but

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
speaking doesn't

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
packets and code make sense but people

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
in politics don't

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,239
you've got a lot to offer but people are

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
not taking you seriously

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
does this sound familiar

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
you and i have a lot in common please

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
stay in this presentation and listen

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
now i mean this very seriously

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
this presentation is intentionally

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
designed

99
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
to get you to take a long hard look in

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
the mirror

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
if you suffer from anxiety depression or

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
related disorder

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
that may trigger negative emotions or

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
behaviors please use discretion in

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
attending this presentation and i mean

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
that in the sincerity of my heart i have

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
dear friends that have committed suicide

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,599
and i never want anybody to face that

109
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
all right first survey and there's a

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,080
couple of already put some stuff in

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
thank you

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
this is the first survey what industry

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
do you work in

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
this helps me get an idea of

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
the people that are here in the audience

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
today

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
and it should automatically pop up there

118
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
we go

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
and uh if you see the same one come up

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
twice it will

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,280
make it bigger there we go

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
word clouds are fun

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
okay we got some healthcare people in

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,919
here all right

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,560
i'm a healthcare guy

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
all right so we've got

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
got a good uh

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
good cross section here software

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
companies

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
information security in general

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
i've met and i've talked to a lot of

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
state government people and

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,600
federal government people that i've met

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
so far at the conference

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
all right this is good if we get to 100

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
it's gonna

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,600
it'll

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,039
stop working on me because i'm too cheap

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
to pay for the actual service

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,840
all right this is good i'll go back to

141
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
it again so we can see later on but this

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
gives me a good idea and hopefully you

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
as well the types of people that are

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
here and

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,520
and what we're what we're learning

146
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,759
okay

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,720
all right cool areas we will cover

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,440
constellations of thought the imposter

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,639
syndrome

150
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
taming your uncouth brilliance

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
and hack to learn learn to teach these

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
are the sections

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
and then i'm going to just right off the

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
bat give you the bottom line up front

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
the 10 mistakes that i made

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
we're going to go over each one of these

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
number one creating bad experiences for

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
others

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,319
two failing to harness the imposter

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
syndrome

161
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
three the mic is always hot

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
for details details too many details

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
five acronym assault

164
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,319
six a vulnerability is not a risk

165
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
seven a control gap is not a risk

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
eight good grief does anyone actually

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
know what a risk is

168
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
nine i don't speak corpy or govi

169
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,800
ten

170
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
why should i learn to land the plane

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,400
we're going to go over each one of these

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,479
so you'll understand what i'm getting at

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
to start with constellations of thought

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
so this has to do

175
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
with how the mind orders things

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
so i want you to imagine in your own

177
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
mind the way that you think about things

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
and how

179
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
you come to your understanding of the

180
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
world that you see around you lots of

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
studies have been done and and i

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
apologize if you happen to be an expert

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
in this field these are things that i've

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,960
learned reading a lot of things online i

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,680
may have completely missed who actually

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
came up with these theories i learned

187
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
them

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
i'm a hacker i pick what i can learn

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
what i can get out of it and i can make

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
it useful for me

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,759
if i have failed to cite or reference

192
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
the person did the research

193
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,639
feel free to come and talk to me about

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,479
it afterward and i will update my slides

195
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,160
but uh

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
the constellations of thought theory i

197
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,560
know there's a lot of people that have

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
talked about this

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
how the mind orders things your mind is

200
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,039
kind of like this vast constellation of

201
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,360
space you've got clusters of stars over

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
here and over here and over here and

203
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,680
what those are are the things that you

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
have thought

205
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
they're the things that you have

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
learned they're the things that

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
people you have met experiences that

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
you've had you classify them in your own

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
constellation

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
you move them around occasionally when

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
you meet someone

212
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
you learn a thing or two about them you

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
have to classify them you want to figure

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
out what constellation am i going to put

215
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
them in

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
they're going to go over here with the

217
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,240
people that don't believe in wearing

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
masks

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
are they going to go over here with the

220
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
people that are religious

221
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,520
are they going to go over here with the

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,879
people that

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
don't know how to really

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
clearly speak and communicate

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
everybody has this in their own head

226
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
everybody thinks this way it's the way

227
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
that the human mind actually maps the

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
information that it records

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,280
the problem is things change

230
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,680
people change over time people become

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
different

232
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,159
over time

233
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,958
things progress you get better at things

234
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,159
eventually

235
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
you get forced to recall

236
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
something that you've already classified

237
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
somewhere you got to bring it forward

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
you've got new input

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,160
now the control variables are different

240
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,399
now the control variables are different

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,320
you have to reassess

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,440
that thing that person that object and

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
you have to now classify it in a new

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,160
spot this is the way that many of us

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
think

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which brings us to and it's not moving

247
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
there we go which brings us to mistake

248
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
number one

249
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,399
creating bad experience for others

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
so jim silva is a data center manager a

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
very very good friend of mine a very

252
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
dear friend and i have a very long list

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
of quotes from jim silva

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,240
that

255
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
just crazy things jim silva has said

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
poor guy he's going to get these dumped

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
on him at his funeral

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
i hate listening to that guy he bounces

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
back and forth between topics like a

260
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,600
fart and a skillet

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
was what he said once

262
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
when you create a bad experience for

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
other people

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,839
it becomes input for the control

265
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,839
variables and they're deciding where to

266
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,560
classify you

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,240
your constellation of things

268
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
your clusters of thought whenever you

269
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
receive new input or meet someone new

270
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
your first inclination is to classify

271
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
that input in other words you want to

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
place it in a cluster of like things

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
constellations of thought are the very

274
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
basis of reputation and bias

275
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
the worst kinds

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,279
of

277
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
reputational and reputation and bias

278
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,800
problems

279
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,959
are when people

280
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
have placed you in a constellation where

281
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
they automatically apply very negative

282
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
attributes that's where bias comes from

283
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
that's where racial bias comes from

284
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
that's where religious bias comes from

285
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,399
it's where gender bias comes from

286
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
it's because people have built that

287
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
constellation they've put people into it

288
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
and they have a really difficult time

289
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
readjusting the way that they see those

290
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
things when that input comes at them

291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
it's not fair

292
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
it's definitely not fair

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,920
but it's the truth and it's the

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
actuality so let's turn that around

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
and

296
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
let's let's test the way this works so

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
this is the next survey what words or

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
memories come to mind when you think of

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
yosemite valley

300
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
if maybe you've been to yosemite before

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,680
i

302
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,519
go ahead and scan and put these in

303
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,040
okay

304
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,959
el capitan the big rock that you can

305
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,320
climb there

306
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
i can see memories coming out probably

307
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,359
somebody spent some time there

308
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
it was hot okay it was hot for somebody

309
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,719
in yosemite valley

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,480
mac os that's interesting

311
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
uh mountain climbing oh good heavens if

312
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
somebody has climbed those rocks in

313
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,519
yosemite

314
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,519
respect

315
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,040
even good heavens wow

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,360
beauty outdoor

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
fire yep there was a fire outside of you

318
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
somebody when i was there once and it

319
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,839
was

320
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
the smoke and the sunset made an

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,079
incredible view of the of half dome

322
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,959
that's my memory

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
all right thimble somebody's hacking

324
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
i don't think it was supposed to have

325
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
graphics in a word word chart but well

326
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
done whoever pulled that one off

327
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
all right this is helpful so what you're

328
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
starting to see is

329
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
perhaps you entered a word and that was

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
the thing that you thought but other

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
people have other things that they

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
associate with yosemite

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
and it's helping you to see that

334
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
your constellation of things may be a

335
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
little bit different than everybody

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
else's but there generally are some

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,600
trends that go in a certain way

338
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
so how does that apply to you well the

339
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
oz principle from the book the oz

340
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
principle there is a pyramid of beliefs

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
experience

342
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,760
creates belief

343
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
beliefs influence actions and then of

344
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
course actions produce results but the

345
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,519
important part i want to focus on the

346
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,560
first two experience create beliefs

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
other people's experience with you

348
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
influences their beliefs about you

349
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,560
that is how they are placing you in

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
their spot in the constellation

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
their experience with you is how they're

352
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
doing that

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
so the experiences that you create for

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
them the experience they have having

355
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
related to you in some way is the way

356
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
that they are thinking of you in their

357
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
mind

358
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
and their beliefs will influence the

359
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
actions the way they speak to you the

360
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,959
way they treat you the way they consider

361
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
what you have to say all of it is

362
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,000
associated with their beliefs about you

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
those beliefs were created in their

364
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,279
constellation

365
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,320
by

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
the experiences that they had with you

367
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
so getting back to the beginning you've

368
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
got a lot to offer but people aren't

369
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,839
taking you seriously

370
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
ask yourself

371
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,880
what experiences have others had with me

372
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
what constellation have they placed me

373
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
in

374
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,140
others constellation of you

375
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,480
[Music]

376
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
uh where have they placed you in their

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
heads what actions did you take that

378
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
shaped their experiences with you

379
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
they may be fair they may not be fair

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
but they're the they're what's in there

381
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,279
you can't control what's in somebody

382
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,199
else's head all you can do is influence

383
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
it the way you influence it is by the

384
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
experiences that you create

385
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,720
with that person

386
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,199
so what experiences of you have you

387
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,839
given to

388
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,040
others don't worry the rest of these

389
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,399
actually go a lot faster because they're

390
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
all based on these first two principles

391
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
do they see you in a way

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
that you think they should see you

393
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,519
what experiences can you change that

394
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
will force them to re-evaluate the

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
constellation they've placed you in

396
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
so for avoiding mistake number one

397
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
creating bad experiences of you for

398
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
others to avoid it learn early in your

399
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
career to shape the experiences others

400
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
have with you

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
experiences

402
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
change beliefs and beliefs lead to

403
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
actions

404
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,079
to fix

405
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
give people new experiences that don't

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
fit with your class variables

407
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
do something different do something

408
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
that's associated with the way you want

409
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
them to experience you and watch the

410
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,079
change occur

411
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
it's also important to note that you

412
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
should do the same for others know that

413
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
other people will change over time

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,560
23 years in health care i was a very

415
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
different person at the beginning of my

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,639
career than it was five years into it

417
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
i was then a very different person 10

418
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,320
years into it

419
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,000
15 years into it people change

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,839
you should expect to change you should

421
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
also expect that other people will

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,760
change allow yourself to change your

423
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,959
constellations of them

424
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
all right mistake number two has to do

425
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
with the imposter syndrome

426
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
all right one more survey

427
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
how would you rank your computer hacking

428
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
skills

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
this was a scale of

430
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,040
one to five how would you rank your

431
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,600
computer hacking skills

432
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,639
are you

433
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,240
pretty darn good

434
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
are you

435
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
pretty much a novice can you hold your

436
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,199
own

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
or do computers laugh at you when you

438
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
walk by

439
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,839
let's see how this starts to come out

440
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,560
we're at 17 19

441
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
20.

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
okay this is going to be important

443
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,600
this how this comes out because it's

444
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
going to probably change the way you

445
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,279
thought about coming into this room

446
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
so we're at statistically significant 30

447
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,680
now

448
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
when you walked into this conference

449
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
when you came to this conference did you

450
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
look at everybody around you and think

451
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
these guys are all really really good

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
hackers

453
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
they're all incredibly good hackers

454
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
they're just they're probably phenomenal

455
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,800
hackers i don't want them to know how

456
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
little i know about hacking

457
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
but you look at the survey and you

458
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,839
realize

459
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
most people

460
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
are very much in the

461
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
c d category at least the people in this

462
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
particular audience

463
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,959
they know some things but they wouldn't

464
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,720
sell those skills to anyone

465
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
pretty much a novice just learning from

466
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,839
others that's how most of the people in

467
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
this room feel we got a few

468
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
that are in the the really really smart

469
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,599
category

470
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,799
so keep that in mind you had an idea in

471
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
your head you had already built your

472
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
constellation of the types of people

473
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,760
that you saw around you with this

474
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,919
conference and when you came you thought

475
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,400
you understood what you were looking at

476
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
realize

477
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,760
that other people

478
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,199
probably don't want you to know they

479
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
don't really know what they're doing

480
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,039
just the same way that many of you feel

481
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,760
in here this is exactly how i felt when

482
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
i sat down at that table at defcon

483
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
i didn't want anybody at that table to

484
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
know that i didn't feel like i really

485
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
knew anything about hacking i'd only

486
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
been a security engineer for a year

487
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
didn't really feel like i knew what i

488
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,880
was doing

489
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
and yet i ended up on a team

490
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
that won the world championship hacker

491
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
competition

492
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
the truth of the matter is

493
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
everybody feels the imposter syndrome

494
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,640
everybody thinks they're nowhere near as

495
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
good as they actually are

496
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
if we knew what we were doing it

497
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
wouldn't be called research now would it

498
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,679
famous quote from albert einstein

499
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
everyone is faking it it's true the

500
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
sooner you come to realize it the sooner

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,559
you'll be able to grow because we only

502
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,799
grow when we do something that we don't

503
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
already know

504
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
makes sense right that's the whole point

505
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
of hacking when you hack

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
you're learning something that you don't

507
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
already know you wouldn't be doing it if

508
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,480
you already knew what you were doing

509
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,080
that's what hacking is that's the art of

510
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
hacking

511
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
i met a young hacker years ago

512
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,720
in the ctf room at defcon at the alexis

513
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
park

514
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
he joined our team digital revelation

515
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
playing capture the flag i didn't know

516
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
he was a speaker that year

517
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,080
but he told me that he was completely

518
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
blown away by how smart everybody at def

519
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,360
con was

520
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
me included

521
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
that made me feel pretty good he said

522
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
that that fact was what motivated him

523
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
the most

524
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
everybody else was so smart he wanted to

525
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
be able to match up so he practiced he

526
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
studied and he read he learned and he

527
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,200
practiced some more

528
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
before i knew it he said people were

529
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
asking me advice about security

530
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
i guess i'd gotten pretty good at it

531
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,280
that young hacker was dan kaminski

532
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,520
if any of you know dan kaminsky

533
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
dan passed away earlier this year

534
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
i say he was a young hacker because he

535
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
was younger than me

536
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,799
they were all pretty young back in those

537
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,080
days

538
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
go back and look at the videos of him

539
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
speaking at defcon 9. he looks just like

540
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,799
joey from the movie hackers

541
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
it's kind of cool

542
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
he was definitely brilliant beyond his

543
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
years yet he had the imposter syndrome

544
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
he thought everybody else was smarter

545
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,720
than him and he worked so hard to get

546
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
smarter and better at doing things and

547
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,799
it was his imposter syndrome that drove

548
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,879
him to excel that was what he taught me

549
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
harness the imposter syndrome to avoid

550
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
mistake number two don't let imposters

551
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,200
control you take charge of it use it to

552
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
motivate yourself and use knowledge that

553
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
others feel the same way to grow your

554
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
own community

555
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
to fix number two

556
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
start disagreeing with that voice in

557
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
your head that tells you you're not good

558
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,520
enough it's a lie

559
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
all right mistakes three through eight

560
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,600
are all in the category of taming your

561
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
uncouth brilliance

562
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,159
and that's another old picture of me

563
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
by the way temptel is my handle

564
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,640
and it's actually short for attempted to

565
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,559
hack the telephone that's a very old

566
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
school

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
handle

568
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
lunchtime rant fests

569
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,799
the mic is always hot

570
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
this is mistake number number three it

571
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
feels so good to get it off your chest

572
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
while talking to a friend at lunch

573
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,799
you could solve all the problems if they

574
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,480
just listened to you

575
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
you're probably right congratulations do

576
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
you feel better

577
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
who else heard you

578
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
person at the next table on the cell

579
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,440
phone maybe

580
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
also in the category of uncouth

581
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
brilliance details details too many

582
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
details

583
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
i love that little comic now that you've

584
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,039
had an overview of the system we're

585
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
ready for a little more detail

586
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
this also relates strongly to mistake

587
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,039
number one creating bad experiences

588
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
yes details matter

589
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,200
but do they really matter to a decision

590
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
maker that already trusts you

591
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
they need to know how bad could it get

592
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
how soon

593
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
and how much will it cost to prevent it

594
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,280
that's really what a leader needs to

595
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
know that's really what a decision maker

596
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
that has the budget needs to know if you

597
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
can give them that

598
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
and as long as they can trust you to use

599
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
those resources to do what needs to be

600
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
done you're in good shape you're in

601
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
really good shape but if you overwhelm

602
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
them with details

603
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
you run into

604
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,760
the imposter syndrome mistake number two

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,919
think i have that here

606
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,039
oh yeah i'll get to that in just a

607
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,559
second but you run into the imposter

608
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,280
syndrome remember everybody is just an

609
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,440
average joe from the bottom to the top

610
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
even the people that got really big

611
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
paying high-paying jobs they're just an

612
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,600
average joe that figured out that

613
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,280
everybody else has the imposter syndrome

614
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,400
too

615
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
they don't want to feel like they don't

616
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
know what you're talking about if you

617
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
overwhelm them with details they'll feel

618
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,080
like they can't keep up with you and

619
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
they'll want to get out of that

620
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
situation

621
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,320
you want to actually tone what you

622
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
actually share with them to just what

623
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
they need to know

624
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,039
and that also fits with acronym assault

625
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,760
we're going to upgrade from edr to xdr

626
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,679
as we retire our sim

627
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
whether we close out our ms mssp depends

628
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
on whether we can staff up

629
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
now some of you probably know what those

630
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,159
acronyms mean edr is enterprise

631
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,600
endpoint

632
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,959
i'm already forgetting what they mean

633
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
anyway exactly my point

634
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,200
acronym overload causes problems that

635
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,559
was one of the mistakes that i made a

636
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,440
lot

637
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
always define your acronyms acronyms

638
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
especially when you're giving a report

639
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,039
define what those acronyms mean even

640
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
even if you think everybody in the room

641
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,320
understands it define it

642
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
undefined acronyms acronyms create bad

643
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
experiences see mistake number one

644
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
you won't impress them with your acronym

645
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
assault see mistake number two they have

646
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,320
the imposter syndrome

647
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
have the emotional intelligence to

648
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,720
perceive the last thing they want for is

649
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,240
for you to find out that they don't

650
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,400
already know what those acronyms are

651
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
that would embarrass them

652
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
all right now we're on to mistake number

653
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,360
six a vulnerability is not a risk

654
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,799
now this is something that if you've

655
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,799
ever taken a class for me i harp on a

656
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
lot especially in the cyber security

657
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
side of information security people love

658
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,559
to say and you can see it kind of in

659
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
that slide i know it's really small

660
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
the top 10 vulnerability endpoints with

661
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,880
high risk vulnerabilities

662
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
let's just get it on the table here

663
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,520
there's no such thing as a high risk

664
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
vulnerability

665
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
you don't know what the risk is until

666
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,760
you know the value of the asset the

667
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
vulnerability is in

668
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,080
until you know the value of

669
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,559
the consequences of that asset being

670
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,919
compromised you can't call it a risk it

671
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
is nothing more than a component of a

672
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,880
risk if you identify a vulnerability

673
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
cves

674
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
i love that when we're identifying and

675
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,159
giving them a label but avoid the

676
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,840
temptation of making a chart like this

677
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
for a leader and saying these are our

678
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
high risk vulnerabilities

679
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,279
so in this particular one how do you

680
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
know the vulnerability on jc taylor's

681
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,600
computer is lower risk than on our fris

682
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
computer if all you're looking at is the

683
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,919
vulnerability

684
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
well if jc if jc j sailor

685
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
i don't know what that one is

686
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,960
is handling large transactions for the

687
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,559
company and if they got out it would

688
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,440
result in competitive loss

689
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
converted loss of competitive advantage

690
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
well now you're able to assess that risk

691
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
but until you know the value of those

692
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,159
assets or the information on those

693
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,760
machines

694
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
you're not really going to be able to

695
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
assess risk don't make the mistake

696
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,799
of

697
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,200
communicating a vulnerability as a risk

698
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,480
when you don't really know it is

699
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,440
mistake number seven a control gap is

700
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
not a risk

701
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,919
people love the nist spa inter-53

702
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,760
control families

703
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
you get into a certain space of the

704
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,279
information security industry and they

705
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,200
just love to pull all these out oh yeah

706
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,840
we've got a we've got a problem with at

707
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
awareness and training they'll throw

708
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
these out and they'll say well yeah you

709
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,880
know we we've got

710
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,159
critical

711
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
risks in

712
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,000
identification identity identification

713
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
and authentication

714
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,320
or an authorization

715
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
again same problem with vulnerability

716
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,440
assessments

717
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
a control gap is a control gap

718
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
but it's not a risk until you have

719
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
assessed the value of the asset

720
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,559
that is at risk that that control is not

721
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,840
effectively protecting

722
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
you need to understand potential loss

723
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
magnitude and threat frequency for

724
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,039
specific threat capabilities

725
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,279
of specific threat capabilities

726
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,520
contacting your asset

727
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
which brings me to mistake number eight

728
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,520
this is something i've harped on over

729
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,799
and over again people that have ever

730
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,799
taken a class from me you'll hear this

731
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
from me a lot does anyone actually know

732
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
what risk is

733
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,919
my way of contemplating risk is heavily

734
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,559
influenced by jack jones factor analysis

735
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,880
of information security risk or the fair

736
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,279
methodology

737
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,840
risk is a function of many variables

738
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
controls vulnerabilities they're just

739
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
factors

740
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,919
they're pieces of risk information that

741
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,679
will lead you to it

742
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,960
and don't worry the next slide i'll blow

743
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
up and we'll actually see all these in

744
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,279
detail

745
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
but it's important to note in the very

746
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
least you must estimate probable

747
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
frequency and probable loss to call it a

748
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
risk

749
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
learn it love it profit

750
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,399
all right that's the actual map this is

751
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,240
this is my own map by the way and i'm

752
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,600
happy to share

753
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
with anybody who wants to take a look at

754
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,520
this it's very much influenced by fair

755
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
if you've ever seen that

756
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,279
but this is how i think of risk and this

757
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,840
is how i communicate risk to leaders now

758
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,159
it helps me to be able to break things

759
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,520
down in this way

760
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,320
so that it becomes useful in the end

761
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,640
it took me a long time to learn this too

762
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
i made the mistakes that i think a lot

763
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
of people in the industry are making i

764
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
was doing that i was making

765
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
vulnerability reports and saying yeah

766
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
these are high-risk vulnerabilities but

767
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,720
you don't know

768
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
you don't know they're high risk until

769
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
you know the value of the assets behind

770
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
them if you make a report saying that

771
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,640
you're making a misleading report

772
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,320
asset risk

773
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
is a combination of

774
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
loss event vulnerability and loss event

775
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
impact you can figure out the

776
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
vulnerability it's a combination of all

777
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
kinds of things threat frequency

778
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
resistance strength how good are we

779
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,080
protecting ourselves from these types of

780
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
vulnerabilities

781
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,720
that's a piece of asset risk but i can't

782
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,960
do it until i combine it

783
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,360
with the loss event impact how bad will

784
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
it get if something goes really really

785
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
wrong

786
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,880
and there's lots of little components to

787
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,360
get into that short-term costs long-term

788
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,159
costs

789
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,760
a wonderful study out there and i didn't

790
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
put this in a slide but if you've heard

791
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
of the ponemon institute they make a

792
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,799
great report they combined with ibm and

793
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
they did this report you can

794
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
get on the internet google pokemon

795
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,399
institute study and you can download

796
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,399
this report after you sell your sold all

797
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
the vendors that want to start sending

798
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,600
you spam email after that it's actually

799
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
a really good report it's worth the spam

800
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
the report talks about every industry

801
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
and the cost of a data security breach

802
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
by industry you'll see that healthcare

803
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,559
for those of you that are in healthcare

804
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,159
out there healthcare has the highest

805
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,720
cost per data breach incident of any

806
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
other industry it's at 429 dollars per

807
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,279
record as of the last report that i saw

808
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
so it makes it easy for you to tell

809
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,440
somebody how

810
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,679
serious the risk is if all i can see is

811
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,480
i've got a vulnerability in this server

812
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
you can say

813
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
this vulnerability is in a server that

814
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,039
has 2.6 million patient records in it

815
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,520
will multiply 2.6 million patient

816
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,799
records by 429 per record now you can

817
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,840
tell

818
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
that leader how risky it is for that

819
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
vulnerability to remain on that server

820
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
now you're speaking their language

821
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,559
all right

822
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,320
hack to learn learn to teach this is

823
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,159
mistakes 9-10

824
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,320
that i made in my career and by the way

825
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,640
that's a little circuit i'd like i love

826
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,399
electronics tinkering

827
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,000
that's a little for those of you that

828
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
are into ham radio i love the little

829
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,399
chinese baofeng radios

830
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,240
and i wanted to be able to take my cheap

831
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,399
20 baofeng radio and hook it up to my

832
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,799
computer to be able to do packet radio

833
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,640
so i designed this little device to do

834
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
that it's a audio separator with a

835
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,279
transformer a usb sound card attached to

836
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,399
it that directly connects to the

837
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,480
separator plugs into the side of the

838
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,320
radio and then usb straight to the

839
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,520
computer handy

840
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
lots of fun i like to hack because i

841
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
learn things as i hack

842
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
under the category of hack to learn

843
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,600
i don't speak corpy or govi

844
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
mistake number nine i've observed at

845
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,039
least three distinct languages in the

846
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,200
information security industry there is

847
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,279
hacker language there's hacker speak

848
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,000
corpy speak and govy speak

849
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,360
three different languages but you've got

850
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
to learn to speak all three in this

851
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,000
industry

852
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,200
you've got to learn to be able to speak

853
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
all three of them because they come from

854
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
completely different standpoints guvies

855
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
use words like cyber theater

856
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,799
completely differently than corpy's do

857
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
to a corpy cyber theater is that thing

858
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
you do to scare executives at investing

859
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,320
in your budget

860
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
to a govi cyber theater is in theater of

861
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,480
warfare

862
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,880
they are vastly different meanings

863
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,519
yet they sometimes use the same words to

864
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,120
use it you gotta learn the difference

865
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
between those two or very big

866
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
misunderstandings can occur

867
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,120
and then hackers speak hackers talk

868
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,399
about code

869
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
as a human knowledge asset

870
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,399
while corpy's see it as a private

871
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
tangible asset or intellectual property

872
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,919
open source software means a lot in the

873
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,080
hacker industry

874
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,320
privacy of software privacy of source

875
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,840
code means a lot to a corporate entity

876
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,519
depending on your audience you have to

877
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,679
be prepared to think of information

878
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,320
security in multiple ways because they

879
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
see it in multiple ways

880
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,320
i just want to hack why would i need to

881
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
know how to land the plane this is

882
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,480
mistake number 10. now i teach pen

883
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,080
testing classes at some of the local

884
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
colleges in sacramento

885
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,679
and

886
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,440
the quickest way to get thrown out of my

887
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
class and i've done this i have thrown

888
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
students out the quickest way is to not

889
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,480
show up

890
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,600
when it's your turn to give a

891
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,640
presentation on a penetration test

892
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,679
to me

893
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,360
landing the plane is giving the

894
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
presentation

895
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
if you cannot

896
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
get yourself comfortable speaking in

897
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
front of a executive audience

898
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,960
you have no business being a pen tester

899
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,440
this is something i will preach over and

900
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,279
over again you may love to hack you may

901
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,679
love to penetrate networks you may love

902
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,039
to break code

903
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,080
you must learn how to communicate what

904
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
you learn when you do those things

905
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,720
otherwise you were just like the 911

906
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,840
attackers

907
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
that only wanted to learn how to fly

908
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,840
but they didn't care to learn how to

909
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
land the plane

910
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,760
giving a presentation after you do a

911
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,679
penetration test that's landing the

912
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,559
plane

913
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,600
and is no value if you haven't

914
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,799
if you haven't learned to teach so it's

915
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,399
hack to learn

916
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,760
learn to teach

917
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
you do the hacking to learn where the

918
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
problems are

919
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
but then you have to learn to teach

920
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,720
what you found to people that don't

921
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
understand it like you

922
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,039
hack to learn learn to teach very

923
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
important principle

924
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,799
in the information security world

925
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,399
all right in summary

926
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,919
from the sections that we talked through

927
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,279
quit complaining that people don't

928
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,480
respect you

929
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
they do

930
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,640
instead change how they experience you

931
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
second stop letting imposter syndrome

932
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
control you use it to motivate you to

933
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,039
become the expert that you see in others

934
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,359
dan kaminski was the best lesson i ever

935
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,320
taught i ever got was from dan

936
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
tame your uncouth brilliance learn to

937
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,199
persuade without offending turn passion

938
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,079
for change into leadership of change

939
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,520
become the solution to broken things

940
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
and then hack to learn learn to teach

941
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,719
this means learning govi and corpy

942
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,719
this means learning to land the

943
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,399
plane thank you

944
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,960
[Applause]

945
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,760
and that picture by the way is uh defcon

946
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,918
10 hacker captured the flag

947
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,440
that's the award ceremony and that's

948
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
dark tangent on the right when he was a

949
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,520
lot younger he's got the black badges in

950
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,639
his hand he was about to hand them out

951
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,760
to all of us

952
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
and the box that's right in front of him

953
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,520
is where he was about to hand us out all

954
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
our leather jackets

955
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
so that was fun so thank you everybody
