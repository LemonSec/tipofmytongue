1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
um on uh being fishers of men and women

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
because we are inclusive

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,799
we uh

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,880
we don't discriminate here

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
um but i will be talking about uh my

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,000
experiences i'm sure there's a lot of

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,519
you in the audience

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
that have a lot more experience and

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,320
expertise

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
in this area but i will be going through

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
some of my experiences and lessons

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,359
learned

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,119
so some of you might not

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,119
hit the same pitfalls

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,439
that i have in my career while running

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
fishing campaigns for users so

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,960
thank you for being here i'll try to to

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
keep it in the time frame i've been

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,760
given

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
all right so i'm gonna

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
i'm going with a gospel theme if you uh

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
haven't realized by the title

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,879
but i am ryan burnett i am currently the

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,800
director of security engineering and

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
operations at pluralsight

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,239
been there about four years but i've

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,480
been around uh

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,839
i've been around the valley

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,120
i started my career at the air force

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
base i did that for a number of years

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
got into security up there then i went

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
over to intermountain healthcare was

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
there for about five years

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,159
then i got tired of work for giant

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
companies and started working for tech

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
startups in utah

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,119
so that's what i've been doing for the

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,320
past

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
oh goodness almost 10 years

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,799
of my career is doing tech startup work

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
so it's been fun going from large giant

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,799
companies to small ones that usually had

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,920
one

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
security hire before me i was usually

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,479
the second and it was greenfield

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
we were building from scratch writing

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
policies super fun stuff

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
so if if some of those programs aren't

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
the best that's probably my fault

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
because i built them

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,320
so that's enough about me

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,799
let's talk about where we're at with

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,960
fishing in

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
just the industry at large

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
we are seeing phishing attacks on pretty

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
much every major breach that happens

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
we're seeing phishing attacks uh as part

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,440
of

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
part of that breach

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
so we are seeing

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
it started out with casting a wide net

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
you you would see

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
these nigerian prints

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
uh emails come through and they were

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
dumbed down on purpose a lot of times

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
we're like who would fall for that and

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
that's actually what the the attackers

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,760
want they want the people that would

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
fall for that they don't want to go for

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
the sophisticated people

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
that are not going to fall for their

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,879
their scams

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,480
so then we saw it moved to spearfishing

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,239
spearfishing

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
has become very common it's where you

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
have a targeted attack against an

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
individual or a company or group

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
it's a lot more specific and they'll

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
gather information they'll do

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
intelligence against the company

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
find out things linkedin is one of the

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,599
best places

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,840
to get information about a company and

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
what you want to attack and who

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
you can find out who their admins are

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
who their hr people are

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
for a company so be very careful what

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
you put on linkedin my linkedin doesn't

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
even have a photo and it has a couple of

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
hashtags of what i do

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
that's my whole linkedin profile so if

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
you look for me on linkedin you're

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,599
probably not going to find me

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,640
um then we saw whaling and

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
executives getting phished and targeted

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
or spoofing and pretending to be an

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
executive we call this business email

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
compromise

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
where they

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
they're pretty basic

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
they say hey i'm in a meeting right now

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
but i need you to do a task for me go

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
and buy 50 gift cards from apple to some

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,159
random person in the company that

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,840
they've never communicated with before

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
but it's the ceo

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
or the cfo asking for it so they do it

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
and they fall for it and i've i've seen

109
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
and heard of companies that

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
this happens and they get bit

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,879
usually a lot of money involved

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
then smishing has become a thing where

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
it's sms text messaging

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
the spam text that you see

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
and then phishing

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,879
just people

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
this is the the old school call on the

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,600
phone and try to get somebody to fall

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
for something

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
lately we've been seeing seo seo

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
poisoning where they try to become the

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
first

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,639
link that shows up

124
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
in a google search

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,320
so if you can figure out how to get your

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
keywords and stuff for your phishing

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
site to come up before the other one

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
people will click that one and then you

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
try to get them to log in get their

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
credentials

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
and then snowshoeing and hailstorming

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,400
these are new terms that have come about

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,919
the past few years

134
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
snowshoeing is doing a like a light

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,479
touch

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,240
where they do it kind of

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
very lightly hit a sprinkle a few people

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
in the company they don't go

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
loud and fast but that's what hail

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
storming is they go loud and fast at a

141
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
company and they do it in a burst and

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
they try to get everybody at once

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
because there is a shelf life for

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
fishing a phishing email has a shelf

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
life and it's usually a matter of days

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,199
if not hours

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,479
so they they have to be very adept

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,720
so those are the current landscape

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
landscape of what we're seeing um also

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,199
recently learned of something called

151
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
fishing as a service

152
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
and we've heard of ransomware as a

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
service and that blew us away well now

154
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
they have phishing as a service there

155
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
are companies um this one called

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
bulletproof link or anthrax it's gone by

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
a few different names

158
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,320
you can for a small sum of eight hundred

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
dollars a month sign up for this service

160
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
they have support

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
they have

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
templates built for you there's over 120

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
templates

164
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
that you get out of the box they'll

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,440
build you custom templates if you want

166
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
and it's turned into

167
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
organized crime for fishing it's crazy

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
but this is this is where we're at

169
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
um it's very effective

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
and it's scary as all get out but this

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
was this was caught by microsoft they

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
they discovered this fishing as a

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
service ring

174
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
um and they've been able to to take it

175
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,919
down but it's it's just gonna keep

176
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,199
coming back

177
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,360
it's really hard especially with all the

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
different countries

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
and

180
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
and the laws and you know we we can't

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
get our reach into them to tell them to

182
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
knock it off

183
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
um

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
so

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
let's see

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
all right so let's talk about building a

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
fishing program at uh the company that

188
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
you work um how many just by raising

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
hands know that you have a fishing

190
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
internal fishing program i mean oh

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,479
that's awesome

192
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
that's about half the room if not more

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
um so it is something

194
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,199
that we have to do

195
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
in our industry unfortunately and i've

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
worked with people that

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
they get a little

198
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,240
defensive or

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
they get a little they feel bad

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
about running a phishing program

201
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
internally they feel like they're

202
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
tricking their users

203
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
and they want the users to trust the

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
security team

205
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
so

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,400
i've seen uh in in my career my

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
experience i've seen some fishing

208
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,800
programs go bad so there are a few

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
different types

210
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,160
of phishing tests that i've i've

211
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
identified that you want to conduct in a

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
company first you want to try

213
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
susceptibility that's the number one you

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
want to see if your users

215
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
are susceptible to fishing and i

216
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,000
guarantee you they are

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,880
the stats that i've seen across multiple

218
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
companies now is generally it's 40

219
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,880
percent will click

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
and 20 to 25

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,319
will give you creds

222
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
and that is scary

223
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
uh even your admins um

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
the thing about phishing is if it's good

225
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,440
enough or if the person's distracted

226
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
or it looks like something they normally

227
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
see

228
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
they can fall for a fish i could fall

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,319
for a fish like we're not immune none of

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
us so we don't ever want to use like

231
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
embarrass people

232
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,039
for for falling for a fishing

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360
you also want to be able to test your

234
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
infrastructure

235
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,039
especially with the move to the cloud

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
we have providers like google and o365

237
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
that are really trying to stomp out

238
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
fishing and it's really really hard for

239
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
them

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,720
but they are

241
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
doing all the buzzwords the machine

242
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,440
learning

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
the ai to detect fishing

244
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,679
with that they'll stomp on your fishing

245
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,200
campaigns

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
when you try to do legitimate fishing if

247
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
that's even a thing

248
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
but they will stomp on you and you're

249
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
going to have to fight with them a

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
little bit

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
and then also you want to test your

252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
incident response process

253
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
for fishing to see if your team

254
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
if your users know how to report

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,959
phishing for one and if your team in any

256
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
automation that you've built is working

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
you want to test that as well so those

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
are the three main types that i've kind

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
of discovered in my career uh that you

260
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
want to test

261
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
so

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
we we always want to we won't want to

263
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
lose the trust of our users

264
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
we want them to trust the security team

265
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
and come to us

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
so even though we think like these

267
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,839
these bad guys we want to be good uh we

268
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
want to make sure that we don't burn

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,959
that trust because it's really easy to

270
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
lose

271
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
so we have um

272
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
as we're building a fishing campaign in

273
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
our in our organization you want to make

274
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
sure you get your leadership to buy in

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
if you don't

276
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,080
uh it will go bad

277
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
people will complain when they when they

278
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
realize it's the security team that

279
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
tricked them they get so mad they get so

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
upset if it's some faceless person out

281
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
of russia

282
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
or

283
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
india or

284
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
africa they're like oh man i can't

285
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
believe i fell for that but when they

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
figure out it was ryan that did it

287
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,680
they get so upset and angry because they

288
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,959
know me

289
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,800
how could i dare

290
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
break that trust

291
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
so they're going to complain

292
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
about a fishing campaign

293
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
so make sure that your leadership backs

294
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,519
you up

295
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
if if they don't don't do it

296
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,279
just don't your your company is probably

297
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
not ready for phishing simulation and

298
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
training in-house until you get an

299
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
executive team or leadership that will

300
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
back you up also let the stakeholders

301
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,959
know

302
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
let the middle management know why this

303
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
is important that we do this we're not

304
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
doing it to try to trick users and make

305
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
the security team look awesome

306
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
we're trying to train them for when the

307
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,720
real ones do get through and they do get

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,959
through there's no filters that are

309
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,680
going to catch them all

310
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
also i've learned that if you give a

311
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,760
heads up just a quick slack message or

312
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,040
an email

313
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
to the executive of the organization

314
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,040
that you're targeting

315
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
and you will be targeting an

316
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
organization within your company whether

317
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
you realize it or not someone is going

318
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,880
to

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
get hammered when you do a phishing

320
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
campaign

321
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
and the users are going to either reach

322
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
out to i t and the help desk they'll get

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
it the most or if you do one around

324
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
benefits the hr team is going to reach

325
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
out

326
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
you've got to let them know ahead ahead

327
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,800
of time so they they know that it isn't

328
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
uh real

329
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,560
and they don't overreact

330
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,839
and that they have uh they know how to

331
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,959
respond

332
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
also

333
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,000
it it's very helpful to do take the

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
exact phishing email that you've you've

335
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,800
crafted and take a screenshot of it and

336
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
share it in your executive leadership

337
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,279
meeting and say this is the email this

338
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
is the subject this is where it's coming

339
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,760
from you don't want your leaders falling

340
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,639
for it

341
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
you want them to detect it

342
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
or their executive assistants to detect

343
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
it

344
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
we have this this industry never hack up

345
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,760
never hack up your chain

346
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,959
you don't want to embarrass them because

347
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,160
they control

348
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
our jobs and our paychecks so set up

349
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
like a racy or rapid if you've heard of

350
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
rapid

351
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,120
around who's responsible accountable

352
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,920
consulted informed and then rapid is

353
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
recommend agree

354
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,519
uh perform input and decide who has the

355
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,240
decision on whether you do fishing and

356
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,959
the go no go

357
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,040
so let's talk about

358
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,639
a couple of times

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
when i did a campaign and it went

360
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
horribly wrong

361
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
i was working at a tech company here in

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
the valley

363
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
and i

364
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
it was a very manual program that we

365
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,279
were running i would go in every week

366
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
and train the new hires about

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
information security why it's important

368
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
and teach them about fishing and then i

369
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,639
would look them in the eye every single

370
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
one of them and say i'm going to fish

371
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,079
you this week

372
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,639
i'm going to fish you expect it be

373
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
looking for it

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
and again i'd get like 40 to 45

375
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
that would fall for it that would click

376
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
and 20 to 25 that would give me their

377
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
creds

378
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,920
so uh we we decided to switch it up one

379
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,440
week and we we crafted the email uh to

380
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
look like it was coming from hr

381
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
and these are all new hires right

382
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
so we said

383
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
in the body of the email

384
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
or in the subject urgent action required

385
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
benefits uh set up incorrectly and then

386
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
the body said hey

387
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
from your hr team there was just a

388
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
generic hey to even give their name your

389
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,800
hr team hey as you onboarded

390
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,079
your benefits didn't get set up

391
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
correctly you got to click this link or

392
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
your benefits aren't going to go through

393
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
eighty percent of the people

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
clicked and gave me credits

395
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
because there were new hires they just

396
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,519
set up their benefits it didn't work got

397
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,320
an email saying it didn't work

398
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
now

399
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
it was a very effective fish

400
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
but the hr team came unglued

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,279
[Music]

402
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
they received every single one of those

403
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,440
people came to the etr team and said

404
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
what's going on why aren't my benefits

405
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,800
set up

406
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
they i hadn't told them beforehand that

407
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
we we'd switched it up

408
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,680
and we also had some people that had

409
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
onboarded

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
and then they had to take immediate

411
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
medical leave

412
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
because of some health conditions

413
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
and so it hit them it hit them right

414
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
home and they were super upset and

415
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
furious and i got a really good chewing

416
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,600
out by hr for that one so

417
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,480
it can go bad if you don't communicate

418
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,839
and if

419
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
the words the hr

420
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,639
my friend used were that fish was too

421
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,240
good

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
and i'm like there's no such thing as

423
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
too good of a fish the attackers don't

424
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,000
care about your people's feelings but

425
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
when they know it's you when they see

426
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,279
your face

427
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,839
they get they get really defensive uh

428
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,760
and offended that you broke their trust

429
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,360
so be aware of that i recommend that you

430
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
create a fishing manifesto

431
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,519
so

432
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,639
many of you have probably seen the

433
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
hacker manifesto i would say for your

434
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
company create a fishing manifesto what

435
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,199
you will do and what you won't do

436
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
and publish it get it out there

437
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
these are kind of the i came up with 11

438
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,519
i tried to get it down to 10 but

439
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,240
11 commandments of what you should do

440
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
for a fishing program so thou shalt

441
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,440
publish a policy where users can get to

442
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
it i would say a company intranet

443
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,519
um i

444
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
that's the best place putting here in

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
your onboarding if you can if you can

446
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
get your your hr team and

447
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
recruiting team to help you out

448
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
um let them know that we're not trying

449
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,639
to just trick them and play stump the

450
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
chump thou shalt not or

451
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
thou shalt let the users know you're not

452
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
trying to do that

453
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,279
thou shalt be as transparent as possible

454
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,519
sometimes you don't want to divulge too

455
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
much about a campaign and fish

456
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
and

457
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
it's going to cause a lot of heartburn

458
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
they're going to be like is this real is

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
this a test i don't know and you're

460
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
gonna have people and with the advent of

461
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
slack and teams and hipchat and all

462
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
these systems now

463
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
they don't go to it or security first

464
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
they go to slack first

465
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,959
and they don't even go to their

466
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
co-workers first they go right to

467
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
general and they throw it in there and

468
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
say hey does anybody else got this oh

469
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
yeah i got this it looks fishy i don't

470
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,440
know and and it just blows up and you've

471
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,199
got all sorts of attention around it so

472
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
try to be as transparent as you can thou

473
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
shalt direct users that fail to a

474
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
notification or additional training

475
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
um a lot of times in phishing campaigns

476
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,399
you can send them to like a 403 or a 500

477
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,160
internal server error

478
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
and what that does it doesn't close the

479
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
loop for the user

480
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
you can close that loop for them so if

481
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,679
you make it a training like hey

482
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
that was a fish sorry you fell for it

483
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,839
and train them immediately it's a lot

484
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,119
more effective

485
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,559
if you just send them out to an error

486
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
page they're like uh did i get my gift

487
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
card did i get my

488
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
right so then they start calling up and

489
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
saying hey i submitted it 12 times like

490
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
where's my

491
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
yeah something's wrong with the server

492
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
so try to try to direct them to

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
additional training and notification

494
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
also track success at an individual

495
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
level i know a lot of companies

496
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
you have to be careful because you don't

497
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,679
want to single people out i would say

498
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
never share the individual results even

499
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
with leadership i would keep it at like

500
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
an organizational level and bubble those

501
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
up because if you share individuals it's

502
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
gonna get out oh my gosh colin falls for

503
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
everything right like you're gonna start

504
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
picking on people and no one wants that

505
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
no calm's great

506
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,160
um

507
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
it was only three in a row

508
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
uh

509
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
let's see also

510
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
provide the metrics up to them in

511
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,840
hopefully you're having some kind of

512
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,559
quarterly at minimum quarterly hopefully

513
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,360
monthly touch point with your leaders

514
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
bubble those metrics up make sure that

515
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
they know this is important that we're

516
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
tracking it we're tracking improvement

517
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
now we could really get in the weeds on

518
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
you know do you do the same email over

519
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
and over again do you do different

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
emails over and over again and it's

521
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
really hard for those metrics but you

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,720
you we have to do something we have to

523
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
be trying

524
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
to mitigate these these fishing so those

525
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
are the thou shouts then i've got some

526
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
shout knots here thou shalt not collect

527
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
passwords

528
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
um this one

529
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,280
if you want to argue with me on this

530
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,480
like

531
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,559
let's let's talk because

532
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
in my experience there's really no

533
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
nothing good you can do with a captured

534
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,200
password the only exception is if

535
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
somebody is jerking your chain with your

536
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
phishing campaign so

537
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
one of our first campaigns we did we had

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
this really smart user

539
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,600
um that created a python script to just

540
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
shove a bunch of crap into our fishing

541
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,799
page

542
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
and then we had to go figure out oh crap

543
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
we got to turn on rate limiting you know

544
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
all sorts of stuff

545
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
but he really jacked with our metrics so

546
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,000
we had to go and purge all of his stuff

547
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and he was just shoving garbage in for

548
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
the username and the password now that

549
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,120
would be maybe the only reason to try to

550
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,720
collect passwords if somebody's jerking

551
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
with you but you can probably figure

552
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
that that out with rate limiting and

553
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
using a result id or a rid

554
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,080
of some unique link for the user so you

555
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
know who to go yell at and this

556
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
individuals and i had a little talk like

557
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
hey you don't want to get on our radar

558
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
like this is not it was cool but

559
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,159
don't get on our radar um

560
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
definitely don't collect any personal

561
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
information you don't want to be

562
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
accountable for socials and medical info

563
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
do not use tests to belittle or

564
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
embarrass users and oh man you want to

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
you want to create a wall of sheep you

566
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
want to like tell

567
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
people that this is a problem and dan

568
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,960
dan's the worst right like you just want

569
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,679
to but try not to um

570
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
don't disclose technical details you

571
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
don't want to you don't want to teach

572
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
your users like all your tricks

573
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,760
and a lot of the solutions nowadays if

574
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
you look under the hood it's kind of

575
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
easy to tell it's a fish

576
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,720
if you're looking at headers but if

577
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,799
users are looking at headers that's a

578
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,240
win like

579
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
that's awesome our users look at

580
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
internet headers on their email

581
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,280
um

582
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,320
don't just uh don't apologize for

583
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
conducting tests um this is where

584
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,039
you don't want to lose their trust but

585
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,120
also don't be like oh i'm so sorry you

586
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
fell for that like you just say hey this

587
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,240
is why we test this is why we do it

588
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,400
um and then also

589
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
don't cause widespread panic throughout

590
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
the company

591
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
um everybody's getting fired we're

592
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
getting acquired you know like all these

593
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,919
different things that would really freak

594
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,039
people out

595
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
especially if you're doing a small

596
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
target group and you're doing like maybe

597
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
a quarter of your users a quarter and

598
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,080
you're going throughout the year to head

599
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
everybody

600
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
you're going to send this out to 25 of

601
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,080
the people and the other 75 are like i

602
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,440
don't i didn't get that email what are

603
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
you talking about we're going to acquire

604
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
like you you don't want to cause a bunch

605
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
of problems

606
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
okay um

607
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,559
so as you're going through your your

608
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
campaign you're conducting it

609
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
it really really helps i can't stress

610
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
this enough to have the comms ready for

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
the teams that are getting it hammered

612
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
this will help them to just copy paste

613
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
copy paste into an email into the teams

614
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
or the slack chat

615
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,320
and just let them know and have your

616
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
people push them through the process

617
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,159
right don't just say oh yeah i was a

618
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,159
fish don't worry about it like say no no

619
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,480
that that looks fishy how about you send

620
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,440
that to fishing at and your company name

621
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
or security at your company name and

622
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,200
have them follow the process for

623
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,280
reporting fishing and hopefully you have

624
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
that process set up

625
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,919
also these mid-level

626
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,280
leaders you want to make sure that

627
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,400
they're

628
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,360
aware

629
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
and

630
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
maybe you divulge maybe you don't it's a

631
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
case-by-case basis but exactly you

632
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
definitely want them in the loop you

633
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,360
don't want your execs to ever get

634
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,039
embarrassed

635
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,520
okay uh also there might be times we

636
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
have to haul to campaign

637
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
there might be times where it goes south

638
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,320
and everybody's freaking out and banging

639
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,520
on the hr

640
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,360
person's door

641
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
but you you may need to halt or

642
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,919
completely

643
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,559
abandon a campaign so have that

644
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
ahead of time have that figured out when

645
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
we will do that like who decides

646
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
who does that does the help desk person

647
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
call up and yell at us and that's good

648
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
enough

649
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,559
if if that's okay that's how you want to

650
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,799
do it but decide ahead of time

651
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,240
so when you do get some pushback

652
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
especially as you're beginning these

653
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
programs

654
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,960
also how long are you going to leave it

655
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,400
running i wouldn't leave the campaign

656
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
running more than a week personally i

657
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,679
think that's plenty of time you have a

658
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,919
shelf life on the fish anyway

659
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,679
most users that are out on leave aren't

660
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,720
going to go look at their email anyway

661
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
and then what to do when they fail like

662
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
are you gonna what is the process for

663
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,039
people and how to report

664
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,480
so this has been extremely helpful

665
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
helpful for me and my team

666
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
as we go through and do a campaign

667
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,640
we create what we call a pre-flight

668
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,159
checklist and things we're going to

669
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,360
check off for every campaign that we do

670
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
right now we're not on an automated

671
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
we're doing quarterly and we're doing it

672
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,200
manually kicking off we don't just have

673
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,960
a system that is automating it yet

674
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
so define your roles and

675
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
responsibilities who's like the lead for

676
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,000
the campaign who are the various

677
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
approvers

678
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
if you need help with the tooling if you

679
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
need help with email

680
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,559
who's your email admin who you're going

681
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,440
to reach out to

682
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,200
o365 and google admins have a lot of

683
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
tools if if your emails

684
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,600
maybe you're running a campaign of a few

685
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,760
hundred users and the first 200 landed

686
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
in the inbox but the second 200

687
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
the machine learning learned about the

688
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
fish and now they're going to junk and

689
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
spam like what are you going to do are

690
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
you going to leave them is that are you

691
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
testing the infrastructure are you

692
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,240
trying to test the susceptibility of

693
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,679
your users

694
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,480
so do you need those email admins to go

695
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
pull them out of junk and put them in

696
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
the inbox

697
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,400
right i've i've done that and it's very

698
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
effective

699
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
who you're going to tell before you even

700
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
even start

701
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
who do you have to tell about the

702
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,799
campaign and that it's even happening

703
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,200
so when are you going to do it what time

704
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,400
send the emails by a certain time maybe

705
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
i've seen both ways where you can either

706
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,600
just blast them all at once and if if

707
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,440
it's a smaller number it's usually not a

708
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,279
big deal or maybe you want to trickle

709
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
them out over a few days

710
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,120
but i'll tell you like people especially

711
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,039
nowadays with slack and hipchat and

712
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
teams like they're going to say

713
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,960
i got a fishing email and it's gonna the

714
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
cat's out of the bag so that shelf life

715
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,120
just gets shortened even more so maybe

716
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,679
you have a ascend you start at

717
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
9am and you go till noon right and you

718
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
set that time window to trickle it out

719
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
over that time that usually is enough

720
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,960
that some of these

721
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
controls by email providers

722
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,960
won't catch the fish unless we're

723
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
talking thousands that's a different

724
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,919
ball game

725
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,440
when are you going to finish it by how

726
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
many days

727
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
what's the pausing halting criteria

728
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,960
campaign type is it susceptibility

729
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
infrastructure

730
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
or

731
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
the incident response that we're testing

732
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
do we acknowledge the campaign do we

733
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,480
tell the user yep that was totally us or

734
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,799
do we let it let it sit let it simmer

735
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,480
see what happens

736
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,159
when users don't know if it was a

737
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,720
security team

738
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,559
there's some risk there if you let it

739
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,360
simmer and you don't fess up to it your

740
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
users might be like why isn't security

741
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
jumping in on this conversation and they

742
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,679
you could lose a little bit of trust

743
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,200
there so be careful

744
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,080
um

745
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
will we move them from spam to junk if

746
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,720
they start getting hammered

747
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
which teams are really going to be

748
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
impacted like really think this through

749
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,559
it helped us for sure

750
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,039
and then whatever if if it's uh

751
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,559
an hr based phishing talk to hr talk to

752
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,320
the frontline people

753
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
the people in hr teams

754
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
make sure that the stakeholders get

755
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
notified

756
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
uh how many users are you gonna actually

757
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,760
target are winning is this a one-time uh

758
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,080
you know burn on a phishing campaign

759
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
and then also get their responses in

760
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,919
their hands

761
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,360
get everything ready for all the

762
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
responses maybe you have a security or a

763
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
general or something that you can

764
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
respond quickly just paste it in there

765
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,480
as long as they're seeing that the

766
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
security team is engaged and like

767
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
responding it usually comforts them a

768
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,159
little bit but if they just get crickets

769
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
they're gonna they're gonna freak out

770
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
and then if you have an automated system

771
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
for reporting and

772
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
we call it haptic feedback on our system

773
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
so as they submit like hey i think

774
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
there's a phishing to our fishing

775
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
domain

776
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
then we send immediately like hey we got

777
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
it we thank you your email landed in our

778
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,320
inbox and they get an automated response

779
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
right back so they at least get that

780
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,399
haptic feedback to the user

781
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,159
that it at least went somewhere it

782
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,919
didn't go off into a black hole which a

783
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,039
lot of times

784
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
unfortunately it does

785
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
and then we we try to do an sla for

786
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,559
responding

787
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
within 24 hours

788
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
so

789
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
last part of the checklist this is when

790
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,799
you're actually at go time we sit down

791
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
and we say okay is the campaign created

792
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,760
are all the the knobs and dials tuned

793
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,919
is are all the users and groups uploaded

794
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
in the the platform that we're using

795
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
um are they up to date when's the last

796
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
time it did a sync with our directory

797
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
that we're pulling in or the upload from

798
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,960
a csv

799
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
have we re distributed everything

800
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
notified the people that need to know

801
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
also i will always recommend doing a

802
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
test uh before you really launch the

803
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
full campaign test against yourselves

804
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,480
your team

805
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,880
see if you're getting banners popping up

806
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,399
especially in oh 365 and google

807
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,480
you'll start seeing some banners pop up

808
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,279
on

809
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
on the emails

810
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,880
and and

811
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
maybe you don't care about those banners

812
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
because that's good the the platform is

813
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
alerting the users

814
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
but maybe you don't want those banners

815
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,840
to show up so do some tests

816
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
um

817
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
do we have the close the loop website up

818
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,200
and is is it working

819
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
and then any automation

820
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
is the email admin actually in the

821
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,240
office when we're going to do this

822
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,360
do we get final approval for a go no go

823
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
and it's all scheduled and then when

824
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,559
it's a closed date so

825
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,880
this checklist that i've just shared has

826
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
been extremely helpful and make sure we

827
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
do it consistently

828
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,399
and that we're defensible and we even

829
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,240
have like artifacts if we ever get

830
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
called on the carpet we can say no no

831
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
this is the campaign this is what we did

832
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,080
and you don't you don't have to worry

833
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
about getting chewed out so some common

834
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,679
issues that i've seen um

835
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,600
when when doing these is

836
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
white listing on the the email gateways

837
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,760
so a lot of companies will put an email

838
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
gateway like a proof point or a mimecast

839
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
maybe a trend out in front of their

840
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,919
email

841
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
and it'll get caught by them before it

842
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,559
ever hits like oh 365 or google or

843
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,640
internal exchange servers like they'll

844
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,320
catch it for you so you have to white

845
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,000
list either

846
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960
the domains or the ip addresses

847
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
and then the banners oh boy okay we're

848
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,520
going to talk about the banners a little

849
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
bit and then the spam confidence levels

850
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
um i think this is specific just to

851
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,200
o365 i don't remember seeing it in gmail

852
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,720
but it will actually in the header show

853
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,399
you the spam confidence level i think

854
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,720
they call sel and it has a number

855
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,559
and you can like figure out if you're

856
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,039
you're phishing even like where are we

857
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,880
on that level of getting smashed by

858
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
their machine learning

859
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
so check those headers

860
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
so i'm going to introduce you to blarvus

861
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
blarvis is the machine learning the the

862
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,000
nickname that i've given to the derpy

863
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,039
ai

864
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,000
machine learning algorithm the o365 and

865
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
gmail use

866
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,760
and it's this little ai monster that's

867
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
checking all the emails and looking

868
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,840
through him and he's pretty derpy okay

869
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360
and sometimes he doesn't do what you

870
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
tell him to so you're sending your

871
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
emails through you got regular emails

872
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
coming in you got your fish coming in

873
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
and they've got

874
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
this ai is the best thing since sliced

875
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,480
bread according to the email providers

876
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
and it's got all the acronyms blockchain

877
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,919
or neural net whatever

878
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,559
you're sending your fishes and then as

879
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,840
the ai

880
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,679
they they will never tell you what the

881
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,240
ai is looking for and

882
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,679
it's frustrating

883
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,760
but i get it because if that information

884
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
got out now all the scammers and the

885
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,000
fishers the real ones now know oh well

886
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,080
if we change our email to look like this

887
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,279
or change our headers look like this

888
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
they get right through right so they do

889
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,039
their secret sauce learning blarvus

890
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,799
chews through them all and then all of a

891
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,960
sudden poof your fishing email just got

892
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
caught

893
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,679
uh by blarvus so

894
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
be very careful as you're doing this

895
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,279
make sure you test

896
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
um he will stomp all over them and chew

897
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,480
them up and they'll just get eaten

898
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,760
um so he'll send it to spam he'll even

899
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,519
reject or quarantine depending on your

900
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,480
settings

901
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,960
the banners oh man you i don't know if

902
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,159
you've seen it in google they've turned

903
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,640
it on for all the individual users the

904
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
the google admin for enterprise has to

905
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,320
go in and turn them on and set the

906
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
settings but for if you have like a

907
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
personal gmail account you'll get those

908
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,480
yellow banners across the top that says

909
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,840
hey this didn't come from your

910
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
organization or hey this one looks weird

911
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,039
or other people said this was fishing

912
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,440
the worst one i've seen is when you go

913
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,159
in and tell blarvis in the google admin

914
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
console whitelist this email whitelist

915
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
the sender whitelist is dns and blarvus

916
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
goes in and puts a gray banner across

917
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,960
the top it says your email admin told me

918
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
to whitelist this so

919
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
i'm going to cover my butt i would have

920
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,159
blocked it but

921
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,640
that's the worst so

922
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,720
be aware of blarvus

923
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,559
all right how to get to expert level

924
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,678
fishing um

925
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
yeah

926
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
we'll we'll talk through each one of

927
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,880
these um

928
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,600
legit domain names so

929
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,399
finding a similar domain name to yours

930
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,640
is pretty easy to do

931
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,679
either

932
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,519
a misspelling or using a different

933
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,120
alphabet

934
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
to sign up for a domain name is very

935
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,799
effective

936
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,679
you can also use subdomains

937
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,919
maybe you're

938
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,679
you find like company benefits or

939
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,640
corporate rewards cards for gift cards

940
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
and you put like your company name in

941
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,360
front of it that's very effective

942
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
a lot of times with shadow i t and all

943
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,000
these different sas companies

944
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,640
teams will go sign up for services and

945
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,880
the sub domain is what says oh yeah this

946
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,559
was our company it signed up for even

947
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,760
though it's this

948
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,640
random other top level domain also

949
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
warming up your domains by registering

950
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,960
them uh maybe at the first of the year

951
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
plan out your your campaigns get your

952
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
domains registered

953
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,320
and so

954
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,399
one one thing we notice is users will

955
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,559
just go do a who is and be like oh this

956
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,480
was registered last week this is totally

957
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,960
fishing so maybe if you want to be a

958
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
little tougher and be expert you could

959
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,679
register them a year in advance and then

960
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,600
they're like whoo this one's been here a

961
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,640
while

962
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
so you can kind of

963
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
get a little more effective that way

964
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,520
um warm up your email server as well

965
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
i've i've used post fix i've used mail

966
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
gun

967
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
i i prefer having my own infrastructure

968
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,079
and

969
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,000
not relying on mail gun but

970
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,839
mail gun's free if you keep it under a

971
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,199
certain threshold you don't have to pay

972
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,879
a lot

973
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,119
so depending on your company size

974
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,719
just running a postfix server and then

975
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
lock it down like so it's not doesn't

976
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,239
become a relay on the internet for

977
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,918
for everybody else to use so make sure

978
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,839
that you've got a lockdown ips and maybe

979
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,679
that it can only send to itself to to

980
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,119
send them out

981
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,000
um

982
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
also baby domains so that's what i was

983
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,599
talking about

984
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,960
they'll go look and see when it was

985
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,079
registered and even the email providers

986
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
and the gateway providers will say well

987
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,399
that domain's only a week old or a month

988
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,239
old so we're going to put extra scrutiny

989
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
and raise that spam confidence level up

990
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,640
and so be aware of those

991
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,160
and i would just say start sending out a

992
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,640
few messages legit messages to yourself

993
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,599
do maybe a hundred a day or for a few

994
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,680
weeks and just send them out that's not

995
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,680
too crazy stagger them out

996
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,760
they're not too smart yet like they're

997
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
not going to notice if you do it on the

998
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
hour

999
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,160
right but once they do kind of pick onto

1000
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
that that oh they're sending out 10

1001
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
emails every hour on the hour they might

1002
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
start the machine machine learning might

1003
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,000
say that's fishy they haven't yet but

1004
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
just be aware it might figure that out

1005
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
and then don't go full bore for maybe a

1006
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
month or two as you're warming up this

1007
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,800
uh this mail server

1008
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,560
um let me talk about

1009
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,320
email getting for a minute so we um

1010
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,680
we had

1011
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,079
at a company i'm aware of had a

1012
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,079
top-level domain

1013
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,839
uh that was being used for their

1014
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,280
corporate email and their marketing

1015
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
emails

1016
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
and the marketing team

1017
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,880
did a campaign with a very very very

1018
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
large company

1019
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
and sent out 40 000 emails to all their

1020
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
users

1021
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
and the users weren't expecting this

1022
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,839
email and they said

1023
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,119
spam

1024
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,960
fish like this is

1025
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
i didn't know this was coming

1026
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,680
well that company was using o365 and

1027
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,800
o365 has kind of this crowdsource model

1028
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
where if they start getting a lot of

1029
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,760
reports

1030
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
into this company they'll trickle it up

1031
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,640
to the top level 0365

1032
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
gateways

1033
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,680
and now every company using o365

1034
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,079
gets these protections

1035
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,000
so when you get thousands of people

1036
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
saying this is a fishing or a spam

1037
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,119
that bubbles up so this company was

1038
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,960
sending legit corporate email but their

1039
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,560
marketing emails were getting marked as

1040
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,440
spam and all their corporate emails to

1041
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,480
o365 customers were now blocked and sent

1042
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
to junk or blocked completely

1043
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,079
so it created something called email

1044
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,040
geddon

1045
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,599
i would say

1046
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,800
compartmentalize i hope you can see that

1047
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,000
picture it's like a ship

1048
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,640
compartmentalize

1049
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,000
your

1050
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,040
domains

1051
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,839
compartment if you can get a separate

1052
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,680
top-level domain for sending your

1053
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,760
marketing emails then you send for your

1054
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
corporate emails if you can't do it your

1055
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
marketing team and everybody's up in

1056
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,640
arms

1057
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,280
get a sub domain have one that's like

1058
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,560
your product dot companyname.com

1059
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,599
or your application dot company name or

1060
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,240
marketing dot company name and keep them

1061
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,000
as separate as you can so when one of

1062
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,280
them blows up

1063
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
it doesn't take down the whole ship and

1064
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,599
your whole company's emails are now

1065
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,680
on the spam list

1066
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
so

1067
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,359
let's see

1068
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,720
let's talk a little bit about the

1069
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
different technologies you can use for

1070
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,760
email sender policy framework spf this

1071
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,920
is basically sent on behalf of nowadays

1072
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
with sas companies

1073
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,520
everybody's going out there and they're

1074
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,560
trying to

1075
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,200
to use different tools to to send emails

1076
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,920
for them for their department use or for

1077
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,599
the application use

1078
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,920
and so you have to go in and say say in

1079
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,240
your headers and in on the internet in

1080
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
the dns for your domain you have to say

1081
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,440
this spf this is who's allowed to send

1082
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,640
as us

1083
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,720
they can use our domain they can use

1084
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
their own domain but these are the

1085
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
people that are allowed to send us us so

1086
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,079
there's a specific format

1087
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,000
you can have multiple records

1088
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
for this there is a an rfc limit of 10

1089
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,040
dns lookups per

1090
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,119
spf record so if you're going in there

1091
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,200
and putting a bunch of domain names you

1092
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
hit that 10th one some of the email

1093
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,040
gateways crap out and they're like

1094
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,839
invalid spf record so what you can do is

1095
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,839
break it out and have different spf

1096
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,079
records and if you have ip addresses for

1097
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,839
all your send on behalf of people you

1098
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,680
can put all those in one spf record and

1099
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,119
you can have a ton of those but if

1100
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
you're doing dns names just be aware

1101
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
there's a limit of 10.

1102
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,480
um there is a at the end of spf you can

1103
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,359
do either a tilde or a minus

1104
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,480
uh the tilde is like a soft fail you you

1105
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,920
tell

1106
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
you're telling the recipient email

1107
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
server what to do anyway but if you do a

1108
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
tilde all that says hey just soft fail

1109
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
if it doesn't match our spf if you do a

1110
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,800
minus all you're telling a recipient

1111
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,359
email server hey dude if it didn't come

1112
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,160
from this list block it reject it bounce

1113
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,320
it whatever you need to do

1114
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,400
but because of the way email is you're

1115
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,920
you're on

1116
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
at the mercy of that recipient email

1117
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
server to decide what to do

1118
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,160
whether it's going to soft fail hard

1119
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,079
fail whatever

1120
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,480
there's a great website for

1121
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
troubleshooting your phishing emails

1122
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,440
mxtoolbox.com

1123
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,240
it's got wonderful tools for spf also

1124
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,400
for dkim dkim is basically public

1125
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,839
private key pair

1126
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,599
that just all it does it doesn't encrypt

1127
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,920
an email what it does it signs the email

1128
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
it says it wasn't tampered with

1129
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,079
in transit over the wire over the

1130
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,880
internet it is basically like a hash

1131
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,160
saying it was signed with this key

1132
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,720
here's our public key you can check it

1133
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
and it's signed and says nope nobody

1134
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,200
messed with email in transit

1135
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
it's not encrypted it's signed

1136
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,079
it also helps build that reputation if

1137
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,560
you put a dqm out on your

1138
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
phishing domains

1139
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,560
and lets those email providers know that

1140
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,880
you're legit

1141
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,359
so you set up a domain key up there

1142
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,440
again mx toolbox will help you set this

1143
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,240
up

1144
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,280
dmarc

1145
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,680
dmarc takes dkim and spf and kind of

1146
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,520
adds another layer on top of it to make

1147
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
sure that you set up dkm and spf

1148
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,480
correctly

1149
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,560
it gives you extra visibility on who's

1150
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,680
sending as you and receiving emails and

1151
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,160
they can respond back

1152
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
uh and you can tell them whether reject

1153
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,480
quarantine

1154
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,720
let's see you can ramp it up if you see

1155
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,640
in that dmarc

1156
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,359
second bolt from the bottom that you can

1157
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,960
percent equals one hundred that's a

1158
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,040
hundred percent of our emails make sure

1159
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,280
it has a d mark you you can ramp that up

1160
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,079
from like 10 20 and just as you're

1161
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,079
rolling dmarc out and get making sure

1162
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,079
that there aren't legit people out there

1163
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,800
spoofing you that you're gonna block

1164
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
go ahead and start messing around with

1165
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,160
the percent there

1166
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,560
mx records uh just

1167
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,280
it's really easy on your dns just do a

1168
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,520
text record with your mx pointing to the

1169
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,680
ip address of where your mail servers

1170
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,240
are this will help legitimize

1171
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,960
your fishing emails

1172
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,119
few open source options out there for

1173
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,160
fishing

1174
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,960
go fish i really really like go fish but

1175
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,640
it's been dormant during the pandemic

1176
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
there haven't been a lot of changes made

1177
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
but jordan wright put a ton of great

1178
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,359
work

1179
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,960
so props to him

1180
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,640
it's written in go the google language

1181
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,560
it's really easy to set up it has great

1182
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,200
dashboards it makes it really simple

1183
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,720
uh evil

1184
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,640
evil jinx is a second one this one

1185
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,079
is really really cool but man is it like

1186
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
it is legit like you can do 2fa

1187
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,400
interception

1188
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
with evil jinx so

1189
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,560
social engineering toolkit by trusted

1190
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,200
second dave kenny is great and then also

1191
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
scripted her out script it out yourself

1192
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,640
if you really hate yourself

1193
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
because everything every change you have

1194
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
to go you have to go in the script a few

1195
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,520
commercial options um i won't name them

1196
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,839
by name but i've used a couple on this

1197
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,280
list and they're they're okay they're

1198
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
pretty decent

1199
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,920
but there's a link if you want to go

1200
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,680
look at them and compare

1201
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
all right as you're going through you're

1202
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,160
you're going to have to become kind of

1203
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,720
an email expert if you want to do really

1204
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,000
good phishing and you have to start

1205
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
learning about headers and how they work

1206
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
and every email that gets sent is a

1207
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,599
brand new email

1208
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,680
it doesn't it's when you hit forward on

1209
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,000
an email that has a brand new email that

1210
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,520
takes the body from the other one and

1211
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,680
has new headers and

1212
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,520
now that gets sent and then it's it's

1213
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,040
done that email exists for that

1214
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,200
conversation when they hit reply it's a

1215
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,920
brand new email different headers so as

1216
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,119
you're going through and setting up

1217
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,680
these these campaigns and you're getting

1218
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,480
users to report it's really important to

1219
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
get those original email headers from

1220
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,359
the original phish

1221
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,400
to tell if it's legit or not

1222
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,880
there's a couple of tools mx toolbox

1223
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,800
azure websites has a great tool for

1224
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,319
parsing out those email headers to make

1225
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,480
them more human readable

1226
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,800
but as you get into this more and do it

1227
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
enough it'll become like the matrix and

1228
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,319
you just can read through headers and

1229
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,880
yeah be nerd okay

1230
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,440
so setting up an infrastructure uh i

1231
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,240
don't have a ton of time left but

1232
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
i would set up i would do all of it i

1233
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,760
would do dnsd cam spf dmarc mx records

1234
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,880
i'd set up post fix on my my box

1235
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,319
really recommend you use your own

1236
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,160
infrastructure if you can

1237
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,760
it's going to be easier

1238
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,720
but i've heard you can use linode to set

1239
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,400
up some phishing servers as long as you

1240
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,200
don't go crazy

1241
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,280
you install go get go fish going

1242
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,440
everything gets stored into a db file

1243
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
for go fish it's really easy if you have

1244
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,200
to back up or move

1245
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,000
to a new new version

1246
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,760
you just take that database file

1247
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,440
you can also

1248
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,720
if you're going to be putting images

1249
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,599
into your html email you can set up a

1250
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,119
simple python http server on the same

1251
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,440
server have it run on some obscure port

1252
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,359
like 90 90 or something

1253
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,560
and

1254
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,640
you can when the email

1255
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,720
calls back to get the image you're

1256
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,720
serving the image from the same server

1257
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,560
so you can use the same domain same ip

1258
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,280
address to put the images into the html

1259
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,599
email

1260
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,920
then you have to set up landing pages

1261
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
sending profiles email templates and

1262
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,440
recipients and then you're good to go

1263
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,599
make sure you have some way to get that

1264
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,160
reporting of phishing back to you so you

1265
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,079
know when people are are reporting it

1266
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,760
rather than clicking or submitting

1267
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
they're calling security or the help

1268
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
desk

1269
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,200
make sure that's all set to go

1270
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,800
here's a little script for go fish that

1271
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,880
i wrote to just start i i get on my

1272
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
gofish server and i run the script i

1273
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,079
just

1274
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,760
it does everything for me runs it in a

1275
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,960
screen

1276
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,200
and then sets up my

1277
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,960
python server

1278
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,119
and then just logs it out so i have some

1279
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,720
evidence that's actually doing something

1280
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
and then to kill it at the end of the

1281
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,960
campaign i just run another script kill

1282
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,240
it

1283
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,119
pretty slick um i'm almost out of time

1284
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:29,920
but

1285
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
i wanted to share one one thing here

1286
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,680
that's totally unrelated but there is an

1287
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,760
e there's a thread on twitter about how

1288
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,839
to scare a security professional in five

1289
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,359
words or less

1290
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,800
go ahead and

1291
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
you can watch the video later or take a

1292
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,119
picture of this but this this is awesome

1293
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,520
and it's going to help you have a great

1294
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,079
halloween

1295
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,599
so

1296
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,880
i will say

1297
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,599
go

1298
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,599
go create a fishing program if you don't

1299
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,400
have one go preach this gospel of

1300
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,280
fishing training to the world

1301
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,540
and thank you for coming to my talk

1302
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:12,210
[Applause]

1303
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,800
he has a question his mic's not working

1304
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,720
what's your question that's embarrassing

1305
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,599
um how do you scram or

1306
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,000
halt your fishing program in the middle

1307
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,160
when something hits the ban do you send

1308
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
out an email saying hey i fished

1309
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
everyone it it depends on how bad it

1310
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
goes

1311
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,960
if if you're getting a ton of blowback

1312
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
maybe you might need to do a comms out

1313
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
to everyone saying hey everybody just

1314
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
fyi that email that went out was a fish

1315
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,200
you don't need to freak out maybe do it

1316
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,040
in slack or maybe you just pause it

1317
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
maybe you just go into the platform and

1318
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,200
pause the campaign and just

1319
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,720
especially if you're trickling emails

1320
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,800
out and you're still sending you just go

1321
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,319
and pause the campaign or halt it from

1322
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,560
there

1323
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
i know it's like right before lunch so i

1324
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,800
get it

1325
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,960
any other fishing horror stories out

1326
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,119
there

1327
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,760
or am i the only one that's ever

1328
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,240
stepped in it

1329
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
so

1330
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,440
okay

1331
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,040
i think we're good

1332
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,160
uh oh

1333
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,399
is it relevant

1334
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,119
the commercial or the

1335
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,599
this one

1336
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,720
for forward too

1337
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,839
oh tell me when

1338
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,040
oh the analyzer sorry if i blew through

1339
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,680
that too fast

1340
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,760
oh sorry

1341
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,280

1342
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,720
like different than the rest

1343
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,000

1344
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,960
i did not know that

1345
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,720

1346
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,800

1347
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,440
fine print

1348
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,559

1349
