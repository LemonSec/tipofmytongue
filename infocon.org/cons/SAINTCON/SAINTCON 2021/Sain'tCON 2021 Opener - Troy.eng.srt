1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
all right well it's time to kick this

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
thing off i'm super excited to kick it

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,799
off

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,200
it's been a long all right well it's

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,120
time to kick this thing off i'm super

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,360
excited to kick it off

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,560
it's been a long time this year it's

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
been a long process this year

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,359
but we want to welcome you to saintcon

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,880
in real life and i'm going to tell you a

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,279
little bit of a story

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
maybe if i follow my slides in order but

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
in real life is our theme this year

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,079
because we

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
we did a virtual event last year and i

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,800
think that we

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
all enjoyed it and it was a good filler

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,640
during the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
height of covid and things last year

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
um but

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
we felt it was super important to get

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,120
back to real life and and get back

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,160
together

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,559
because most of what we do in the

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,360
security and i.t industry is through

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,239
peers camaraderie and other things and

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,000
so we decided this would be our theme

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,039
this year

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
i want to just mention that the st khan

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,480
conference is

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,479
produced and brought to you by the utah

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,000
saint organization which is a non-profit

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
that basically is just the

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
uh the official business arm of the the

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
saintcon conference uh we'll have a

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
booth downstairs it's an organization

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
you can join as a security professional

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
and we actually have a way to do that

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,759
this year

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,560
so if you want details

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
uh you can stop by the booth down there

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
but also for those of you well i'll tell

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,479
you in a minute because i've got a slide

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
for that

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
but i just wanted to thank our our board

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
for the utah saint organization and our

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
conference committee and other folks

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
for their participation in in planning

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
st com this year

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,680
our mission if it's not clear

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
as a non-profit organization and for

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
this conference is to provide community

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
and opportunity for security and i.t

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,119
professionals

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
to have to be more effective and

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,560
connected with their peers

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
and the tools they need to be successful

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
and that's that's a summation of what

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,160
we're about and why we're here it's not

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,639
a business or or anything it's

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
absolutely

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
a labor of love by many

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
so let's talk about saintcon planning

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
just a little bit we're going to tell

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
a little bit of a story i won't take

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
very much of your time

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
on it but there's some interesting

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,239
points here

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
this is our normal planning cycle for

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
saintcon

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
sometime you know between october

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
and january the committee and everybody

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
gets to rest and that's it by the time

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,959
january comes around we start this all

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,480
over again

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
and one of the questions that we always

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
get asked is how do i get involved and

78
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,280
or how can i help out with saint kahn

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
and other things and it starts around

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
january with our call for committee

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,319
and things we did that this year in

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
january

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
and that's when we decided hey we're

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
going to plan for an in-person

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,239
conference and everything and we have a

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,080
retreat where we invite all of the

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,159
committee members to get together

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
sometime around april and we plan all of

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,760
the

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,840
or we bring up all the ideas and and

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
things and we figure out what we're

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
going to try and pull off for this year

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
and then through the pursuing months

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
there's a lot of detail that's not in

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
this particular slide

96
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
but by july

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
we do kind of a go no go that's when we

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
decide whether to launch registration or

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
not now we've never not launched it sort

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
of but last year there was this kobit

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,400
thing

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
but let me show you what look what july

103
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,599
looked like for us

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
so if you look at that little dip right

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
in the middle

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480
we're seeing covid going down we're

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
thinking we can do this in person event

108
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
and we can do it awesome

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
and that's when we're like okay we're

110
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
going to do this we launched it

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
and then this crazy delta variant thing

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
kind of ramped up a little bit and so

113
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
this is me for the next three months

114
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
thinking oh my goodness gracious what

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
are we going to do

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
how are we going to handle covid on top

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
of an in-person event

118
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,879
and be safe and everything else and so i

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
literally if you ask my wife she's

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
around here somewhere this is what i

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
looked like for three months

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,519
so

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,760
we did a lot of internal discussions and

124
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,238
things and we figured we asked ourselves

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
how do you hold a 1200 plus person event

126
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
with covid cases again skyrocketing and

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
doing it safely

128
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
and so for those of you that are here

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
you've obviously

130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,639
become aware of our covered restrictions

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
and everything

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
but i just want to say thank you

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
for being willing and able to

134
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,040
comply with our coveted restrictions

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
during this event

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
part of the reason for this is when we

137
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
were deliberating and talking about this

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
as a committee

139
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,000
we all know people who have gotten

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,360
seriously ill

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
and there are too many stories of where

142
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
people died

143
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,680
and there's even stories and and people

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
in our own security community that we've

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,919
known and loved over the years that have

146
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
perished to due to this and so

147
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
for us it was important to make sure

148
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
that if we're going to get our community

149
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
together that we were going to do it

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
safely and so that's why those

151
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,919
restrictions are in place we're not

152
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,919
trying to

153
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,600
be oppressive or or make you do

154
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
something that's terrible or awful that

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,120
you might have a different opinion about

156
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
we respect everybody's opinions on where

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
they're at

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
but we know that we need to be safe for

159
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
our for the sake of our community and so

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
i applaud you for being willing to do

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
that i know masks are hot

162
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,160
in fact i shouldn't be wearing one

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
because i'm speaking but i'm doing it

164
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
anyway because that's it was on

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
i know they're hot and they're

166
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
uncomfortable

167
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
and things but please

168
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
uh help us out and let's keep our

169
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,639
community safe while we're here this

170
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,919
year

171
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,160
and we hope that next year it's just a

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,639
non-issue okay that's everybody cross

173
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
your fingers and toes together and next

174
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,639
year we just won't even have to deal

175
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
with it but despite everything

176
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
there is still some covet impact on our

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,919
conference and so

178
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,160
there are some things that in the last

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
minutes

180
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
of planning everything

181
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
that are canceled and things and i'll

182
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,479
kind of mention those they're not big

183
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
super crazy things but you need to

184
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
understand that despite all we've been

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
able to do there are some cancellations

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
and things

187
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
so if we want to get right down to the

188
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
secret of how this comes together

189
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,560
it's because you got this guy right here

190
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
now that's me you know a caricature

191
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,160
but

192
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
that doesn't tell even a tenth of the

193
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,800
story

194
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
it's because i'm surrounded by all these

195
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
folks

196
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
now a lot of them are in silhouette

197
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,479
because i don't have cool characters for

198
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,520
every single one of them because our

199
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
committee keeps growing

200
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
year over year but these are the folks

201
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
that are responsible

202
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
for putting this conference together

203
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
and making it successful and we really

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
appreciate our conference planning

205
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,319
committee so

206
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
our thank you to them

207
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
when when you get together and you've

208
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
got an event that becomes this big

209
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
logistics and everything else become

210
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,919
exponential and so it's a tough thing to

211
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,000
pull together each year so just be aware

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and thank them when you see them

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
all right we'll move on to some of the

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
normal things that i would normally open

215
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,280
with and let's talk about our sponsors

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,240
this year

217
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,880
one of the things that we do is we allow

218
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,639
sponsors to come in and participate at

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,560
our conference

220
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
and we do that because that's how we

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
have nice things

222
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
that really cool badge that we'll talk

223
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
about a little bit later in the

224
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
presentation today that's around your

225
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,280
neck is made possible in part by the

226
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,360
by our sponsors and so these are our

227
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
sponsors

228
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
for the the saintcon conference this

229
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
year they're all going to have booths in

230
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
and around the conference

231
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
would you take some time

232
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
and visit their booths see what they're

233
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
off or see what they're capable of

234
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
helping you with whether it's tools

235
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
services and other things and if things

236
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
make sense we're not trying to say hey

237
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
go buy stuff from them

238
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
uh and things but if things make sense

239
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
would you look and see if some of these

240
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
sponsors might be able to help you out

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,919
in some of those areas because we

242
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
appreciate them being here they're

243
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
excellent partners with us

244
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
and some of them are sponsoring like

245
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,680
centracom the internet connection that

246
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,479
we've got here is provided by them

247
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
and some of the gear to run the network

248
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
and things are provided by others it's

249
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
it's an amazing thing that they do to

250
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
help us put this conference on each year

251
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
so we are thankful for them and their

252
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
involvement

253
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
yeah thank you

254
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,319
and then the last couple of things i

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
just want to say the conference this

256
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,279
year

257
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,719
as we went through our planning we were

258
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,120
ambitious this year with our planning

259
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,399
and what we thought that we could pull

260
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,958
off and what we were able to pull off

261
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,519
and so there is more to do at sync on

262
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,360
this year than ever before not like you

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
needed more to distract you from

264
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,519
everything else that you want to do

265
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,279
you will absolutely have the problem

266
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,320
this year of not being able to be all of

267
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
the places that you want to be because

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
there's so much going on

269
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
and this is kind of a general overview

270
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
of all of the things

271
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
or most of the things that are going on

272
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
at sync on this year

273
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
i'll focus in on just a couple of things

274
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
some of our contests that we have

275
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,959
if you'll notice there we've got a

276
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,120
canceled sign over the vault that is one

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
of the casualties of covid

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,959
so not to give any personal information

279
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,519
or anything else but the folks that are

280
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
uh administrating the vault came down

281
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
with cobit

282
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
um they're fully vaccinated it's a

283
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
breakthrough kind of case thing uh and

284
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
they're they're not able to be here and

285
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,200
so we've replaced the vault with some

286
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
other things so there's gonna be a space

287
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
in our expo central expo center for the

288
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
vault and people running things but just

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
be aware that that's one of the

290
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
casualties that we've had this year of

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
covid and i say that casualty is

292
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
probably not the right word that's a

293
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
harsh word but it's one of the things

294
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
that's not going to be quite the same

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,040
this year

296
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
but the rest of the contest the hackers

297
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
challenge game how many of you are here

298
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
for the first time i didn't ask that

299
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
question earlier okay we love to see a

300
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
lot of hands welcome to our community

301
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
we love to see new people and have

302
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
people get involved

303
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
contests are one of the funnest things

304
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
that you can do here at st con

305
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
the hackers challenge game is

306
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
notoriously fun

307
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
okay it teaches good skills

308
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
and for hacking and other things and it

309
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
really introduces you to some of these

310
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
concepts that you're going to find and

311
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
be able to use around the conference i'm

312
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
not going to go through all these uh

313
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
contests but new are some things like

314
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
the password cracking or sorry the

315
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
scavenger hunt the packet capturing

316
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
contests and other things go check those

317
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,880
out we have a ton of new well a ton of

318
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
communities

319
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
that are participating this year some of

320
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
these are are returning some of them

321
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
have been here for many years and some

322
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
of them are brand new but we also want

323
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
to highlight a couple of the or a couple

324
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
of our local

325
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
hacker or community or security

326
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,920
community groups like the dc435

327
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,279
can i hear them they're in the house

328
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,519
right

329
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
one of the coolest new up-and-coming

330
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
defcon group chapters

331
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
so if you're in the northern utah area

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,519
you most certainly want to hook up with

333
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,880
these guys

334
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
and gals and get involved

335
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
the other one that we've got is the

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
women in cyber security group that are

337
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
going to have a booth downstairs do we

338
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
have them in the house to this morning

339
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
yeah okay i saw a hand

340
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,399
you can yell somebody yelled for them

341
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
but anyways they're here

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
uh and we love to see women get into

343
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
this field there's something different

344
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
about

345
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
how a woman can

346
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,600
look at

347
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
cybersecurity things that are going on

348
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
and see it differently and better than

349
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,600
many of us

350
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,240
men can do and i'm being honest there

351
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
and then our dc 801 community they've

352
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
been around for a long time but we're

353
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
appreciative of their involvement

354
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,240
many of them run these communities

355
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
contests and other things for us and so

356
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,519
we appreciate them

357
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,880
let's talk really quickly about how you

358
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
get connected and then i'm i'm way over

359
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
my time almost already

360
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
but saintcon comes we always have a way

361
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,279
for you to join the discussion to heckle

362
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,880
the presenters

363
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,360
uh and things this year it's really

364
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
simple to join

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
we use discord and we switched over to

366
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
discord last year during sync con 2020

367
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,560
and it will be our

368
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
communications method of choice for the

369
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
foreseeable future we're not going to

370
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
switch you to slack and then to other

371
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,680
things

372
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
this is where we're s we're staying for

373
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
a while we made it really easy and grew

374
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,160
our server to the size that we can

375
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
actually have custom url so if you just

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,639
go to that url you can join our discord

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
server and have access to all of the

378
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,120
saintcon channels and information

379
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,880
and things in there that's a great place

380
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
to hang out not just during the

381
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
conference but that is our utah saint

382
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
community and all of the other cyber

383
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,079
security communities participate in that

384
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,920
space as well so come in hang out chat

385

386
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
doing

387
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
let's talk really briefly about some of

388
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,240
the events that we have going on at st

389
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
com this year

390
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
some of these are probably pretty well

391
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,519
known for those of you that are first

392
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
timers these are gonna sound weird

393
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
um tin foil hat talks we've got going on

394
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
this year you're just gonna have to find

395
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,480
out and hear through the grapevine where

396
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
that's at the hack in the box community

397
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
for those of you that haven't

398
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
had an opportunity to get too involved

399
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,120
in the hack in the box stuff it's here

400
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
in conference this year rather than

401
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
outside and it's actually

402
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
not in this conference center it's in

403
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
the hyatt across the street and you're

404
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,959
welcome to look at the schedule

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279

406
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
and come hang out and just chill with uh

407
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,519
like-minded folks over there our

408
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
leadership community is upstairs

409
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:44,880
uh

410
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
or and

411
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
doing their thing it's it's a wonderful

412
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
event that they've got going on up there

413
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
and we have this something new this year

414
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,519
it's the little gremlin down in the

415
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,000
bottom right uh we have a saintcon store

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,079
so if you haven't been aware of that one

417
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
of the questions we always get asked is

418
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
how do i buy that really cool hoodie or

419
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
whatever

420
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,279
there's a way for you to do that this

421
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
year supplies are limited but

422
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
you can go down there and check that out

423
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
there's all kinds of fun things there

424
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
and then the last one that i wanted to

425
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
kind of focus on

426
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,279
is for those of you that are family men

427
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
women or otherwise

428
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
that have children that would enjoy

429
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
an event

430
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
we have our saintcon kids event on

431
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,199
wednesday night

432
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
pre-registration is required for that

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,079
event so go to the website it's got all

434
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
of the details but if you're coming let

435
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
make sure you pre-register

436
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,519
but this is one of the coolest and most

437
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
detailed planned events that we've ever

438
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
done for our saint con kids

439
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
night so we would highly encourage you

440
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
to participate but that's

441
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
totally up to you as well so just want

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
to make sure you knew it's

443
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
pre-registration needs to happen there

444
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
okay i'm almost done let's talk about

445
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,560
mini badges real quick

446
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,000
we went way overboard on many badges

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
this year

448
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
this is probably a tenth of the mini

449
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
badges that are out there for you to

450
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,399
collect many badges for those of you

451
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
that are new or don't have a solid

452
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
understanding think of it like olympic

453
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,959
pins or merit badges

454
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,240
that you can go around the conference

455
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
and get involved with these different

456
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
communities or contests or events and

457
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
you can get these little cool badges

458
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,959
that have lights on them or different

459
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
features that you can put together in

460
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
our hardware hacking community

461
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
and they fit in that little extender

462
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,240
board that plugs into your badge

463
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,199
and it's

464
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,800
it's a cool thing to carry around and

465
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
have and and collect the things that

466
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,279
you've worked on and done so we've got

467
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,800
more mini badges than ever before and

468
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,839
we've got to tell you where you're going

469
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,199
to put them so we're going to talk about

470
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,680
the badge but to do that i would never

471
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
do it enough justice so

472
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,519
we would like to welcome compy kid mike

473
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
up to the up to the stage

474
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,240
and he's going to take you through and

475
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
talk to you just give you the intro to

476
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,279
the badge

477
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,240
for a few minutes and

478
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,959
there's one screen after that

479
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,320
with the pit that of the picture on it

480
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
so go ahead i'm just going to stand over

481
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,839
here out of the way

482
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
can you hear me all right

483
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,399
so

484
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
the badge this year

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,519
we wanted to do something different that

486
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
hasn't been done before

487
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
and one of the things we always get

488
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,839
asked is

489
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
sponsors want ways to get your contact

490
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,079
information

491
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,399
and we won't give it to them

492
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,070
so

493
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,440
[Music]

494
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
but you can

495
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,160
so at registration um if you noticed

496
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
your badges were being programmed with

497
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
your personal information it's got your

498
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,759
name your email address and

499
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,120
the companies that you put in your

500
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
registration

501
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
so

502
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,880
you get to choose that's it

503
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,639
those three things are programmed in

504
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,839
your badge

505
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,480
you choose when or if you want to share

506
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
that information

507
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,880
so

508
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,199
from the menu

509
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
normally when it's

510
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
your badge is closed all right you got

511
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,000
the little red circle crossed out over

512
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,439
the little contact

513
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,959
symbol

514
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,760
so

515
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
if it's like that your contact

516
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
information is not being shared

517
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,480
if you pop open the shackle by pushing

518
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
the little button on the back and pop it

519
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,720
open

520
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,119
changes to the other little icon and

521
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,079
then anyone with phone with nfc can scan

522
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
that and get your contact info so you

523
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,039
can share that with vendors share it

524
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
with people you meet here

525
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
whatever you want to do that's your info

526
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
to share

527
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
so we've also got a couple games in the

528
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
badge

529
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,918
there is

530
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
i don't even know what we call that game

531
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
um anyways there's a couple games in

532
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
there to play there's one that's also

533
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
usb text based

534
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,080
so you can play with that

535
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
you can collect different items to build

536
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
different things inside your badge

537
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,520
there's a whole separate game in there

538
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
to build this big uh machine

539
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
and so you gather those by

540
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
there's some unlocks in the badge

541
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
there's if you notice there's a combo

542
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
lock entry screen right so there are

543
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
combo locks around or combos around the

544
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
conference

545
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,480
people have some nfc tags that you can

546
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
scan get you things and then you can

547
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
trade those with other people badge to

548
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,559
badge

549
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,320
um on the the right side of your badge

550
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
there's a little tiny button it's really

551
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,679
tiny and hard to press

552
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,520
that is the back button

553
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,200
so

554
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
if you get stuck in a screen that goes

555
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
back to the menu

556
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,880
battery life

557
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
is an unknown

558
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
it depends on how many mini badges you

559
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
connect to your badge many badges will

560
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
suck your batteries dry in a couple

561
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,199
hours um

562
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
so

563
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,360
um

564
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
yeah turn your badge off at night right

565
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,520
because

566
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,039
even though the screen does turn off

567
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
after a minute

568
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
it will still kill your battery

569
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
overnight

570
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,160
okay

571
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
and mini badge extenders connect a

572
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,360
little bit differently this year i've

573
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
seen lots of crazy ways that people have

574
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
been soldering their mini badge

575
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,679
extensions

576
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
this is what it should look like

577
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
so the mini badge extender board can be

578
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
soldered the way it looks the way the

579
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
silk screen is on the board match that

580
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
up with the connectors and just fold

581
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
over the ribbon to plug it into the back

582
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,678
of the badge

583
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,120
yeah that's all i got all right well

584
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,520
first of all before he he tops off the

585
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
screen

586
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
this man does an amazing job every

587
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
single year for us

588
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160

590
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,000

591
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,120

592
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799

620
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,000
one of the things that i wanted to make

621
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
sure that everybody is aware of this is

622
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,440
how we have nice things okay

623
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440

627
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
with us today

628
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,159
lock picking lawyer videos that we're

629
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
going to show you

630
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
is that a little bit of a disappointment

631
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
i'm just teasing no we have the

632
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
lock-picking lawyer here with us

and he's going to present

634
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,799
but

635
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,559
as many of you know that when you watch

636
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
his videos on youtube probably all of

637
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
you are subscribed if you're not

638
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
subscribed he's like 3.5 million

639
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
we could probably get him to 4 million

640
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,480
today right

641
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,080
if you're not please do subscribe i'll

642
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,600
say that for him um but uh you never see

643
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
anything but his hands and that's on

644
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
purpose he he

645
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
uh

646
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,360
he's an anonymous type person and so

647
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,919
we're asking that if that you don't film

648
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,159
uh or video or you know take pictures or

649
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
anything else we are going to be taking

650
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
video of the session and we'll be doing

651
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
the appropriate things that we need to

652
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
to make sure that it's releasable

653
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
without compromising any of that

654
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
process so it'll be available for you

655
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,559
after the conference and so you don't

656
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,480
need to record it or anything else if we

657
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
do see you recording we're going to ask

658
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
you to leave promptly okay that's

659
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
what we've agreed to do for lock picking

660
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
lawyer and

661
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,720
how we have such cool uh such a cool

662

663
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,000
lawyer in a moment

664
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,400
this is another coveted casualty

665
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,000
as it were for us snow also

666
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
uh it's related to the vault because the

667
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
person who runs the vault

668
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
