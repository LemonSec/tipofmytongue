as zev vlagg

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
i run the hackers challenge contest here

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
at st con um i won't be giving any wave

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
flags today in this talk so if you're

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
here just to find a hacker's challenge

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,840
flag

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
you're in the wrong talk

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,279
that being said if you want to leave i

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,519
won't feel hurt at all

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,800
otherwise please stay and i love to talk

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
um and we'll learn a lot about security

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
tools that you could use in hackers

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,280
challenge or your day-to-day jobs

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
a hundred tools or less or more or less

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,399
probably a lot less is all we'll get to

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,320
uh there takes

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,760
a lot of tools to hit in a short amount

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
of time

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,039
but this is a one-on-one level course

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,800
and i'm going to spend a few minutes on

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
each tool giving an introduction what it

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
does how it works and then a please to

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
you to go learn a lot more

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
if you have questions about a particular

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,719
tool

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,879
i won't see your hands but feel free to

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
yell them out and i'll repeat them and

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
we can talk about them either or find me

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
after with your suggestions because i

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
definitely don't know all the tools

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
but these are what i've learned and what

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,920
i use and have found very beneficial

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,280
so i'm going to start with some network

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,600
tools

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,200
nmap

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,320
uh by show of hands maybe you've

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,479
actually used nmap before

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
good good and maps are great if you want

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,040
in-depth on nmap i'm going to ask you to

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
leave right now and go upstairs there is

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
an awesome tutorial going on

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
if you want to be an nmap expert go

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
upstairs right now

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,119
nmap is great it allows you to scan a

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,000
network uh i love nmap

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
for the basic flags like dash capital a

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,280
and dash

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
o that let you do

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,840
scanning for operating systems and a

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,439
in-depth scan

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
against

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
networks and discoverability

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,280
but what's even more awesome in nmap and

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
what i would suggest as a security

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
expert where you start is that you go

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
and learn about the nmap scripting

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
engine the nse

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
the nmap scripting engine provides

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,280
hundreds of plug-ins to nmap they'll let

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
you

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
not only scan for ports and hosts

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
but let you do more ability scanning and

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,280
look for methods to exploit as well

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
so for your nmap 101 i'm going to push

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
it further and say go learn about the

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
nmap security engine or the nmap

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,799
scripting engine nse

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
a couple of my favorite flags for nmap

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,959
um scan entire ip range this this this

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,400
is a unobtrusive scan dash sp that just

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
will turn back anything that responds to

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
a ping scan

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
uh dash o for operating systems and then

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
if you feel a little bit more aggressive

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
use the dash t flags for timing and a

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,400
flag for an aggressive scan that does

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
scans many more ports now in-app's huge

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
so once again if you want in-map

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
tutorial go upstairs right now

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
uh next tool

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
wireshark

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
wireshark is one of my favorites and

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,040
i want to see by show of hands when you

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
think wireshark is scary

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
or hard to use

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
okay

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
i get that a lot and a lot of people say

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,599
hey go use wireshark you can open your p

92
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
cap open your network captures and use

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
wireshark and they say but it's so hard

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
to get the information out of there

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,400
wireshark is my favorite

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,959
it has so many dissectors built in

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
and so much configurability they say hey

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
i want to i know the stream i'm looking

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
at is maybe a sip stream and it's got

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,799
voice in it and so you can go and you

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,000
can tell hey

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
i know that they've changed it so i'm

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
not running port 5060 for sip on voice

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
and you say nmap

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
i know that actually they're on a

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
voice on 50 70 and it will read

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
redissect that traffic on that new port

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,640
wireshark is awesome it provides

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
a capability

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,439
for you to capture packets both in

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,519
windows and linux and mac os

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,560
and then

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
dissect and dig into those packets

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
uh once upon a time wireshark was known

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
as ethereal it's been around for a long

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
time

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
and something you probably didn't know

118
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
about wireshark that's really awesome

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,798
from a security point of view is that

120
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,040
well it doesn't only do ethernet

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
but it does usb it does bluetooth

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
it does

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
uh about every protocol you can imagine

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
from satellite protocols to

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,919
[Music]

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,080
like i said low level usb protocols so

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
you can actually install

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
a driver on your computer to capture usb

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
packets so if you've got a nefarious usb

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
device or something that's not working

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
right you can capture those usb packets

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
and view them in wireshark

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,199
so a little hint for you go learn a

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,240
little bit more about wire shortcuts

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
capabilities

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
there's lots more i'm gonna go on and

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
we're gonna talk about some defensive uh

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
tools

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
if you and honestly feel free to raise

140
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
your hand or yell out and say hey show

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,759
me more i wanna know more about that i

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,320
will open the tool up and i'll show you

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
uh one of my favorite defensive tools

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
is splunk

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
and you're gonna say hey splunk's an

146
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
enterprise tool it's something that we

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,600
run in our shop and i don't get to play

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
on that data

149
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
but splunk has a free version so if you

150
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
want to run it at home

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
you can end just up to like 100

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
megabytes of logs per day for free

153
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
um and so i highly suggest as a security

154
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,800
professional you learn to use splunk

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
it's used all over the place and it's

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,400
useful even in your own home

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
environments

158
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
when i spend on my hacker's challenge

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
game i log my traffic to splunk i take

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
my nginx server i take my unicorn

161
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
servers i take my database servers and i

162
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
send all those logs to splunk to

163
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,600
correlate and watch for you attackers as

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
you try to break the environments

165
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,000
so no cheating because i will catch you

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
like i said but splunk one of the

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
benefits is that it has a free version

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,199
that allows you to learn it and use it

169
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,720
at home

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
on that same note i don't have a slide

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
for it but an alternative is an elk

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
stack which is elasticsearch uh

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,520
log stash and cabana and they provide a

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
completely free alternatives to splunk

175
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
that you can use to gather your logs

176
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
correlate them draw graphs and pull out

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
data that otherwise you might not see

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
staying on the defensive side if you are

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,120
in an incident response role and you're

180
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,400
saying okay i've been asked to look at

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
respond to this incident and we thought

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
we had some while we're on a machine or

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,039
we don't know what this employee was

184
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,080
doing and we've got to look at it and

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
respond we don't know what happened on

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,039
here

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,400
a wonderful tool to use is called

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
autopsy

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,919
autopsy is a digital forensic

190
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
investigator tool

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
it does really cool stuff

192
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
it can do anywhere from iphones uh to

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
hard drive images

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
on multiple operating systems and it

195
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,840
will go and it will tear through this

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
hard drive image however you captured it

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
and extract evidence extract urls

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
extract documents extract histories

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,919
it can pull from the ntfs journal and

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,919
find oh this stuff was actually deleted

201
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,800
um

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
or this this file was accessed but that

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
doesn't exist anymore

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
so autopsy incident response in a

205
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,759
forensic role it's a powerful powerful

206
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,759
tool

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
that so you step aside from okay i'm

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
working on physical media something's

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
been stored to now okay i'm working on

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
something that's volatile i'm working on

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
my ram so

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
if you have a malware or you have

213
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,160
data that's been

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
something that's in memory and the

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
server or the workstation hasn't been

216
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
shut down

217
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,080
then the tool you want to use is

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,440
volatility

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,319
and it will allow you to parse through a

220
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
memory dump

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,520
and so

222
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
you can take a snapshot of the

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
memory of a windows workstation or the

224
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
memory of a linux workstation and in

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
that memory you're going to find all

226
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
sorts of interesting things it's

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
shocking how much is stored in ram on a

228
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,080
running workstation

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
if you want to see just how much that

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
really is play the hackers challenge

231
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
today we have

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
two or three categories they're all

233
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,840
about memory dumps and we give you a

234
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
several gigabyte image

235
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
of a windows workstation whether we just

236
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,240
flash the ram and save the copy of it

237
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
for you

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
and you'll be able to take and use a

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
tool such as volatility

240
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
to tear through it find mac addresses

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
find

242
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
malware find

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
where hosts were connected what they

244
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
were doing

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
and you'll it's once again um

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
it's shocking how much is there let's

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
say for example even on a linux server

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
the puzzle's not there i didn't forget

249
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
to finish making this here but

250
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
the ssh keys are there so if you have an

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
active ssh connection the keys that

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,959
encrypt that connection are in memory so

253
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
someone captures the packets of that

254
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
network traffic going through the same

255
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
wireshark

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,519
and then

257
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
they are able to

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
dump the memory of that workstation

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
all everything that's happened in that

260
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,120
ssh tunnel can be decrypted with

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,120
volatility

262
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
uh how do you get that memory

263
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
one of my favorite tools on the linux

264
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
world is called lime it is

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
the

266
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
linux memory

267
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
extractor

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,360
and

269
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
it's awesome because it's a

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
loadable kernel

271
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,959
so you don't have to actually you don't

272
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
have to put it on disk it doesn't have

273
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
to be compiled or built into your kernel

274
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
it's just a kernel module that you can

275
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
load at a random time

276
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,519
and then it will open up a tcp port or

277
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,839
it will write an sd card and just dump

278
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
everything in memory at that moment

279
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,560
and save it so you can process it in

280
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
volatility

281
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,519
once again that's called lime that's the

282
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
linux memory extractor

283
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
and one side note so to go one step

284
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,040
further with lime

285
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
it works on android

286
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,519
because android has this linux kernel

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,720
base

288
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
the lime project will let you insert a

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
module into an android device and dump

290
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
its memory as well

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,640
often you will find that android malware

292
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,760
runs in memory only

293
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
okay so you've got a piece of malware or

294
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
you've got something new like what is

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,600
this file

296
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
what where is it good is it bad

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
i bet many of you used virus total

298
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
it's a very common tool

299
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,200
to analyze a file and and it's and

300
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
determine whether it's good or bad

301
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,399
i have found i really like this the

302
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,200
website hybridanalysis.com

303
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
it

304
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,040
integrates with cobalt strike falcon

305
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
virus total and a couple others to

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
provide a more holistic view of file and

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
then they execute it in a sandbox and

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
you're able to click through and see

309
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
artifacts of the file and build your

310
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,760
indicators of compromise

311
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
so from a defensive point of view uh i

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,279
highly recommend that as you add

313
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
analyzing content or you have a windows

314
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,519
executable you don't know what does drop

315
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
it at hybrid analysis.com and

316
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
have an insight on how that operates

317
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
um and then of course

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
this is an old standby for security

319
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
tools this one's called nessus it is a

320
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
vulnerability scanner um it's not

321
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,399
completely free as it used to be but

322
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
it's a

323
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
very much a tool that hey if you're

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
getting into the security world you want

325
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
to handle vulnerability analysis uh

326
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
nessus is a great way to scan a network

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
for and look for the low-hanging fruit

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
and to be aware of what needs patched

329
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
okay found onto the offensive rolls

330
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
i'm just going to jump through a lot of

331
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,279
categories here

332
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,480
if you have questions once again please

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,639
feel free to yell them out um and i will

334
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
try to respond to them

335
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
uh wordpress i bet if i already ask well

336
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
i'm gonna ask anyways how many of you

337
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,079
are in an environment where you know

338
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,519
that your com your organization has a

339
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,720
wordpress website i know our mind does

340
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
and they're common all out throughout

341
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
education in utah they're common

342
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
throughout all over the world it is the

343
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
number one content management system out

344
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,519
there

345
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,560
um

346
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,399
and so i highly recommend you become

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
familiar with wp scan it's a ruby module

348
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
a ruby gem that

349
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,480
integrates with the

350
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,399
wordpress vulnerability database and

351
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
will scan a wordpress site looking for

352
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,079
old plugins old themes vulnerable

353
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,680
wordpress versions

354
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,480
and

355
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
a slew just hundreds of misconfiguration

356
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,480
options

357
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
to look for the vulnerabilities that an

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
attacker are going to find those low

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
hanging fruit

360
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
it's extremely powerful

361
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
so if you in an environment where you're

362
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,720
needing to

363
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,440
attack or defend a w

364
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
wordpress site wp scan is your friend

365
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
um on that same note and we'll go down

366
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
i missed my image well

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
uh web vulnerability scanner so nicto uh

368
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
on the same

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,279
same note http scanner so nikto is cool

370
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,760
it looks for

371
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
not application level configurations

372
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,440
like wp scan but it goes down to the web

373
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
server so it'll say it'll detect what

374
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
version your web server is whether it's

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,560
iis it's apache it's nginx

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
and it will go through and it'll scan

377
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
for http headers like cores

378
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
and

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
various cookies timeouts and it will

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
look through all the lower level http

381
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
type stuff that you're concerned about

382
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,639
to look for misconfigurations

383
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
from an offensive side is really useful

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
to gather information to understand your

385
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
target

386
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
so if you're on a recon mission and

387
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
you're trying to attack a web server

388
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,199
nikto is a great tool to give you a

389
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,920
first hold

390
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
hashcat

391
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
so your password tracking and you're

392
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,199
like okay i've got a i got compromise

393
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,720
server uh i have access to the etsy

394
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
shadow file or i have access to

395
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
the windows hash database or the sam

396
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
database um

397
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
or you've got a password vault from

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
voltage which happens to be one of our

399
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
challenges

400
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,480
the hashcat is the all-around performant

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
password cracker

402
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
it's extreme versatile so you can plug

403
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
this to all sorts of stuff into it it

404
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
supports several hundred different hash

405
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,480
formats

406
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
be they sha-1 md5 salted

407
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
hash catch-up trend and

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
whether you can you're cracking on cpu

409
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,320
or you're cracking on gpu hashcat's

410
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
amazing

411
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
it lets you specify flags so not only do

412
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
you do brute force and do every

413
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
character one by one um but it will let

414
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
you do dictionary type attacks and so

415
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
you take a word list like rock you

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
or you can take

417
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,360
and build smart hacking a smart password

418
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
tracking attacks if you want to learn

419
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
more about hashcat

420
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
for password tracking we have a password

421
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
tracking village downstairs they will

422
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
gladly walk you through how to use

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,160
hashcat that's what they do you've seen

424
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
all those gpus down there they do an

425
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,760
amazing job at it

426
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
once again hash cat is cool because it's

427
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
not just about brute force but it's the

428
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
ability to build smart lists that will

429
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
say okay

430
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
take this word list and alter it to be

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
elite speak take this word list and

432
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,399
append the most common

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,240
characters at the end and so you don't

434
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
have to build all these variables but it

435
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
will do it for you

436
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
another tool uh basic tool of the trade

437
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,120
that you want to get to know from the

438
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
defensive side is metasploit so

439
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
metasploit is an extremely powerful tool

440
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,279
it's a framework that almost every

441
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,720
common

442
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
cve

443
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,399
exploit or proof of concept gets built

444
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,160
into this framework because it provides

445
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
a simple way to

446
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
uh weaponize an attack and so it's

447
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
really quick for someone to say oh this

448
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
new cve let's say for apache the apache

449
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
1.49 version that happened last month or

450
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,199
dot 50 as they try to fix and failed

451
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
again or finally 51 and it still wasn't

452
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,279
quite fixed um

453
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,800
that

454
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,959
it was there was an exploit built on it

455
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,600
and it was released at uh

456
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,279
exploitdb.com and it was

457
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,120
immediately poured into metasploit and

458
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
so municipalities

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,000
with this framework says okay i'm going

460
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,519
to define this host i'm going to define

461
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,959
these ports and i'm going to find this

462
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,199
payload and then just click run and the

463
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
attack happens and then you're dropped

464
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
with a shell

465
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,399
and so metasploit is a tool i would

466
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,680
highly recommend that you learn from

467
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,000
attacker point of view

468
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
we often run labs here at st con to help

469
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
you walk through it and the tutorials on

470
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
youtube are wonderful

471
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,000
if you are working on the hacker

472
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,279
challenge puzzle line that's on some of

473
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,720
the web vulnerabilities particularly

474
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
that last one uh

475
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
or the first pointable i'm not sure

476
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,920
where it is but uh metasploit would help

477
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
you if you're trying to

478
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,800
script that attack

479
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,400
uh all around wonderful tool burp suite

480
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
there is a wonderful community edition

481
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,039
now burp suite is cool because it makes

482
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,400
it really simple i want to show you this

483
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
burp suite makes it really cool to

484
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,599
inject yourself into a

485
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
web application to

486
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
attack

487
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
so i'm just going to start a new project

488
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,559
and i'll zoom in here for a second once

489
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,200
i get to the juicy stuff

490
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
and a lot of people say oh but burst is

491
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
so hard to get running how do i get my

492
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
web browser configured because you have

493
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
to configure your browsers to proxy

494
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,200
through it

495
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
and in modern versions of burp suite

496
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
you're able

497
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
to just come up here and click on the

498
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
proxy tab

499
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
and there's this cool button right here

500
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
now they've added that's the open in

501
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
browser button

502
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,760
and they've

503
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
taken and they've included a pre-built

504
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
version of chromium that is configured

505
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,400
to automatically proxy through burp and

506
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
so i can go to hackerschallenge.org

507
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,160
and you'll notice that it's not loaded

508
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,440
and the reason it's not loaded is

509
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
because burp suites now right you're

510
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,120
waiting right here with my request and i

511
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,200
can edit that request i can say oh i

512
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
don't actually want to go there i would

513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
go somewhere else

514
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,480
and then i can forward it

515
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,919
and but or i can turn off the intercept

516
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,679
so i'll turn off intercept and it's

517
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,120
going to automatically forward all the

518
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,399
packets and my page loads

519
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
and then burp suite gives you this

520
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
really cool ability

521
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,880
to come to your history and you can see

522
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
all the requests that were made by that

523
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
browser

524
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,919
and then you can take and i can take and

525
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
right click on one and send it to

526
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
repeater

527
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
and so repeater is going to let me

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
repeat that request that's happened

529
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
and make modifications and do it again

530
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
and again

531
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,879
i click sequencer

532
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,039
send to repeater

533
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,559
and so i can sit here and i can modify

534
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,720
this request which is really really

535
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
helpful so you say oh i know i need to

536
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
do this thing but the browser keeps

537
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,520
escaping my url or the browser

538
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,559
or my client doesn't want to accept this

539
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,679
and so you can just sit here and i get

540
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
it and they say oh i know that

541
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
this i actually want to use a different

542
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
cookie uh because i captured my cookie

543
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,039
from an another attack and so burp suite

544
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,200
lets you send that request and see the

545
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
response immediately and make iterative

546
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
changes against it

547
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
and so burp suite runs on mac os windows

548
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
linux uh the free version is great

549
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,480
they do have

550
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
uh more advanced capabilities you pay

551
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,200
for it

552
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
but it's tool worth learning an

553
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,039
alternative some people like better is

554
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,559
fiddler i don't have a lot of personal

555
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
experience with fiddler but

556
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
if you're

557
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
into wanting to understand and proxy web

558
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,679
interface

559
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,880
web

560
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
http requests or websockets fiddler does

561
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,159
a really good job and it's an interface

562
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
worth exploring

563
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
it accomplishes made the same purpose as

564
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,919
burp it doesn't have quite as many

565
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,280
plug-ins and

566
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
and

567
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,919
community-built tools to support it

568
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,799
but it's an alternative

569
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
um on a similar vein if you're working

570
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,159
with apis so you've got a json file or

571
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,960
swagger file and and you want to

572
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
be able to quickly change headers and be

573
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,679
able to

574
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,000
define your apis the tool i suggest for

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
that is postman once again another

576
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
community tool

577
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
works on most platforms

578
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,320
and it's for you know your rest or json

579
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
or other apis postman is the tool to use

580
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,720
to modify those and make that extremely

581
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,000
simple um another tool to trade and i'm

582
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
not saying any sql in particular but

583
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
learn sql

584
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
sql is the structured query language

585
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
that you use to communicate with

586
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
databases whether it be mysql

587
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,760
sql server oracle sql sqlite

588
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
i would

589
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,600
voyager that 95 of all web applications

590
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
have a database of some sort back end

591
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
you won't use it for mongodb or some

592
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,440
other nosql type environments but

593
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
sql is extremely powerful in my job

594
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
as a red team

595
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,799
in the red team environment in my job as

596
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,640
a blue team of application security in

597
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,440
my job as it system admins i've used sql

598
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
for years

599
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
and years

600
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
and it has been extremely valuable

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
whether you're trying to expose and

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,760
attack

603
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
a

604
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,280
threshold injection a male a

605
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
misconfigured website

606
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
or you're just trying to analyze data

607
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,120
learn how to sql learn how to properly

608
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,440
do selects learn how to join databases

609
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
learn how to do sub queries learn how to

610
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,159
concatenate learn how to union

611
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
learning learning sql is something

612
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
that's going to provide provided tons of

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
power for me

614
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
and opportunities to

615
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,559
further

616
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
myself in the security world

617
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,158
it's something that

618
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
when

619
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
i'm on a team and i am able to

620
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
understand this quill

621
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
that

622
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
i have brought a lot of opportunities to

623
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
myself because of that

624
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
so i highly recommend it

625
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
and it's a great attack attack surface

626
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,520
for many other websites

627
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
another tool of the trade and i got a

628
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,679
lot of laughs when i said this but excel

629
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,039
i'm going to ask the query here how many

630
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
of you feel like excel's an important

631
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
part of your day job

632
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
i i think

633
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,159
it's sad that we do so much in a

634
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,080
spreadsheet but it's true

635
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
and become an excel power user learn how

636
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
to use basic vbscript learn how to

637
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
use the various functions to

638
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,799
do pivot tables in excel learn how to

639
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,240
exclude and do uh vmaps and

640
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
you'll you'll find

641
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,039
that

642
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,159
as an excel power user you will

643
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
be able to understand and parse the data

644
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
that's presented to you in a much more

645
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
efficient way

646
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
and yes i flick is a very very important

647
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
security tool

648
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,039
okay let's go on let's go to talk about

649
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,000
some reverse engineering tools

650
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,080
uh if you were reverse engineering a

651
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
binary

652
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
is built for the.net environment you

653
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,320
definitely want to learn to use

654
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,360
dnspy.net spy

655
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,840
it is excellent at providing source code

656
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
back from a.net and binary

657
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
um

658
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
yeah

659
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,679
so uh

660
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,440
dnspy.netspy is what you want

661
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
for many windows applications and even

662
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
mono applications that run on linux

663
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
built into the dotnet framework

664
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,360
guidra a few years ago the nsa open

665
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
sourced their free their

666
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
homegrown

667
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,120
decompiler and reverse engineering tool

668
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,559
and i imagined that the company that

669
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
x-rays that builds ida

670
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
was very disappointed because aguirre

671
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,320
performs amazingly

672
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
it's decompiler's not quite as excellent

673
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,960
as

674
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
x-rays but it's way

675
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,799
up there and it's getting there and it's

676
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,440
free and has plugs in and supports many

677
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
many many uh processors and environments

678
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
so learn guidra if you're reverse

679
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
engineering

680
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
another tool i don't have a picture of a

681
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
moment here is ida um

682
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,520
ida went ahead and released a free

683
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,919
version uh that supports a few select

684
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,200
architectures

685
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
but they are very excellent at some of

686
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
that reverse engineering especially for

687
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799
go and so their free cloud decompiler

688
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
for a goling

689
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,279
does excellent at uh reverse engineering

690
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,919
and decompiling readable c style source

691
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
for goaling in ida free

692
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
a binary ninja this is my new favorite

693
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
um

694
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
it is very very friendly to scripting

695
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
and plugins

696
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,080
and it is very relatively

697
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,960
inexpensive uh if your gators free from

698
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
the nsa uh ida is away on the far end

699
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,279
except for the free version that

700
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,080
supports a few small environments um

701
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
as expensive and binary ninja is

702
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
relatively cheap you're only going to

703
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
spend

704
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,159
a couple hundred dollars in license for

705
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,279
that instead of a couple thousand

706
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
dollars of license for it

707
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
but it does excellent at reverse

708
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
engineering and decompiling

709
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
um and making it simple to walk through

710
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
in a tree structure of as you reverse

711
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,799
engineering binaries

712
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,679
i'll

713
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,799
and i can't talk about reverse

714
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
engineering without also commenting on

715
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
hopper if you have a

716
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
mac os binary that you're trying to

717
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,039
understand

718
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
build an objective c for iphone or for

719
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,799
mac os

720
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,120
hopper is excellent

721
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
and it is also relatively inexpensive

722
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,440
has a free version at least trial

723
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,720
version

724
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,799
that works very well so if you're

725
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,919
reverse engineering or needing to

726
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,720
understand some malware in the

727
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,279
mac os apple world i strongly suggest

728
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,640
hopper

729
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
and it does do linux and other

730
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
environments but there they excel for

731
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,440
objective c

732
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
i keep going everything else other tools

733
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,279
um cyber chef

734
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,960
by show of hands many of you have used

735
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,279
cybershift

736
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,159
okay

737
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,760
so there's a lot of hands

738
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
not as many as i'd love to see the cyber

739
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
chef is a swiss army knife i want to

740
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,799
show you some of the coolness of it

741
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,240
let's open a new tab here okay

742
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,120
so

743
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,320
gchq which is the

744
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,799
british i don't even remember what it is

745
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,240
i'm sure someone else knows but it's one

746
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
of the british intelligence

747
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
branches uh built build cyber chef

748
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,480
and it is a swiss army knife tool

749
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,039
that lets you do everything uh well lets

750
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,240
you do tons of things so if i were to

751
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
take and say hey i had this binary

752
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,918
string

753
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
i could easily take this binary string

754
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
in my

755
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,919
input and i could say i want to go from

756
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
binary

757
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
i'll pull this over here to my recipe

758
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,279
and it's going to put it right here in

759
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
the output

760
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
and it'll tell me what it is

761
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,520
you know so i can make a string of

762
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
binaries

763
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,120
and it's going to take here and decode

764
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
it which is pretty cool but what makes

765
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,600
it super powerful is i can say okay i'm

766
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
going to take this and i'm going to go

767
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,000
to base64

768
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
oh great perfect it'll give me 2 base64

769
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,559
or

770
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,799
let's do this way

771
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
i can grab

772
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,559
an image

773
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,480
so i've got an image here and i'm going

774
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
to go to base64 and it basically pours

775
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,760
it

776
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,799
and then

777
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,480
it has lots of cool functionality

778
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,640
that i can do things like detect

779
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
uh see what

780
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,799
uh

781
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
i can do things like extract files so

782
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
it's gonna find the before look for

783
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,919
files in it

784
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,480
and it lets you string together

785
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,360
many operations

786
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,640
build a good example of a string here

787
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,919
so i can say

788
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,200
this is

789
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,840
my hello message

790
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
to sync con

791
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,240
and i can go to base64 and let's say i

792
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,279
then wanted to write 13 that text

793
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,080
or and then

794
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
so i've taken a basic two more message

795
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,200
and i brought 13 it

796
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
and then let's say i wanted to

797
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
encode it with aes

798
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
i can take it i can aes encrypt it and

799
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
it'll ask me for my proper ivs my keys

800
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,000
and

801
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
this seems like very contrived and it is

802
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,240
but what cyber chef does is lets you

803
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
give you a powerful toolbox with

804
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,200
hundreds of tools together

805
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,080
if you were let's say you're working on

806
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,559
a binary reverse engineering problem and

807
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,880
you found a string that you can say oh

808
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
that the string was bit shifted left one

809
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
by four bytes and then it got xored with

810
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
the slash 20 or ox 20. um

811
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,679
cybership will you take that text and

812
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,840
just reproduce and

813
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
chain those actions along in a very

814
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,600
powerful method

815
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
and in my red team job from day to day

816
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
uh i'll often do this in python but for

817
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,679
all the things that aren't doing in

818
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,080
python cyber chef is my number two spot

819
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
to go to do this and so if you're

820
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
working on a hacker's challenge

821
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,640
or if you're working in security in

822
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,559
general a sniper ship has a is a

823
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
wonderful toolbox

824
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,679
and once again that's cyber chef it's on

825
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,279
github but it was published by the gchq

826
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
uh base64

827
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,960
it's a basic tool um i showed it here

828
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
and it's not just for puzzles base64

829
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
allows you to take text takes binary

830
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,480
takes take any data and encode it in a

831
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,799
manner that is presentable in standard

832
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,559
ascii characters

833
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,919
uh when you're trying to move data

834
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,880
around

835
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
in a security world uh ascii character

836
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
is a lot easier to not get mangled and

837
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
get a miss and so base64 is a great tool

838
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,640
for encoding and decoding data you can

839
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,559
encode basics forward or terminal copy

840
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,039
paste it out drop it across the

841
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
serial connection drop it across

842
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
ssh shell and transfer around and then

843
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,600
decode it without it ever being flagged

844
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,679
um binary base64 is an easy way to

845
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,200
transport data

846
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,760
that doesn't get analyzed as easily

847
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
though it's very much not an encryption

848
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,600
method

849
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,640
tools

850
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
learn how to use curl or wget

851
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,039
dozens and dozens and dozens of powerful

852
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,519
options in these tools

853
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,919
you can post you can

854
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,039
send form data you can do

855
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,440
recursive lookups and continue down

856
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
trees across as you're trying to pull

857
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,399
from urls or web servers curl and wget

858
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,039
is a command line interface

859
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,919
to

860
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,600
web servers and

861
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
the power that's behind them is amazing

862
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
i strongly suggest you learn these

863
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
kernels you get

864
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
the easiest way to solve some of these

865
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
hacker challenges is similar to this

866
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,799
string here in curl uh you have problems

867
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
with the if you're trying to work on one

868
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,159
of them particularly that that won't

869
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,159
help won't work unless you're in curl

870
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,200
because

871
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
it gets

872
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
wrongly encoded by your browser or just

873
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
on the command line

874
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
another awesome tool

875
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
not enough people know about this but

876
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
this is called jq

877
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,279
and it

878
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,760
allows you to query or to

879
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,000
easily parse json data

880
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,559
the web now is moved to json apis all

881
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,159
over the place

882
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,440
and so let's take for example

883
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,279
this

884
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,840
data here

885
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,200
so if i've got

886
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,120
if i've queried my web server

887
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,799
something like this in curl

888
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,039
and i've piped it to cat and

889
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,760
i've got my list of users.json and this

890
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,399
is what the website returned

891
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
this happens to be the hackers challenge

892
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
scoreboard at the moment but this is

893
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
pretty hard to pursue and understand

894
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
so jq

895
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,519
is a great tool that lets you

896
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
parse this data and present it in

897
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
meaningful ways so i'll start first by

898
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,000
going something like this i'll just

899
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
parse it to jq

900
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,960
and it makes it pretty

901
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,039
it was here at the top of this list

902
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,840
today

903
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,679
congrats to our first place user right

904
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,080
now who is factor

905
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,919
um but

906
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,760
so i piped it up we've got a pretty list

907
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
i can go even further with jq and i can

908
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,880
search for things so let's say i just

909
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,840
wanted to jump the data and there we go

910
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,279
and then let's say i want to go further

911
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
and i want to

912
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,840
just see names so i can par parse with

913
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,559
jq and it'll take this huge json blob

914
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,039
and allow me to easily present

915
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,960
information from it and use it in a

916
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,640
structured way

917
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
so

918
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,880
if you're

919
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,039
working and you've amongst apis in some

920
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,360
way i strongly suggest learning ujq to

921
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,158
parse your structured data

922
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,840
the windows subsystem for linux

923
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
this is an awesome powerful addition by

924
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,720
microsoft in recent years to windows

925
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,399
you can run

926
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,200
almost all linux binaries

927
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
in windows natively via the windows

928
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,840
subsystem for linux

929
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,960
and so

930
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,720
as i talk about these tools like oh i

931
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
don't have linux i don't have i run a

932
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,320
windows environment all this can run

933
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,919
natively in windows so learn how to use

934
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,040
the windows subsystem for linux

935
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,399
proxy chains this is a cool tool

936
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,159
this allows you let's say you're working

937
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,639
an application and you want to be able

938
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,800
to say oh what what's this binary doing

939
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,918
what's calling out to the web it's

940
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:24,800
calling

941
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,839
sending data it's doing this thing and

942
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,599
there's no way for me to change its

943
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,440
proxy there's no way for me to force it

944
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
to go through

945
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,639
burp suite or through fiddler and i want

946
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,359
to

947
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,440
encrypt that or i want to inspect that

948
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,440
traffic so proxy chains is another linux

949
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,399
linux kernel module that will

950
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
er was actually not like experiment but

951
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,040
it's a linux library that lets you hook

952
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,879
into an application

953
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,839
and overwrite the network functions in

954
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,560
it

955
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,719
so that it will force them to be proxied

956
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,960
through your proxy

957
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
so if you've got some malware or

958
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,480
something that you're trying to

959
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
investigate

960
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,240
proxy chains can make that easier to

961
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,520
understand the behavior of an

962
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,000
application

963
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,079
it's also really annoying sometimes when

964
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,040
people solve your puzzles with it

965
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,000
because

966
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,800
it cheats but it works

967
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
um

968
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,079
emulation um

969
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,520
it's shocking to me how many people

970
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
have never actually ran virtualbox or

971
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,599
vmware or qmu on the workstation and

972
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,040
said hey i need to boot up another

973
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,680
operating system i need to emulate this

974
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,800
environment um and so

975
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,440
they are extremely powerful and as a 101

976
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
tool

977
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
you can run windows on your mac

978
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
you can run linux on windows you can run

979
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,839
mac os

980
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,079
on windows and so you can emulate these

981
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,520
environments

982
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
you can power you can spin up a arm

983
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,640
emulated cpu

984
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,520
uh

985
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,760
with via qmu you can spin up a motorola

986
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,320
processor in qmu and emulate these

987
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
things so that you don't have to have

988
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,960
that physical hardware environment

989
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
i believe that virtualization is a

990
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,800
security 101 tool that you should know

991
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
how to use

992
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,720
and have those environments built

993
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,920
learn how to snapshot with them so you

994
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,839
can roll back learn how to

995
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
dump the memories from them so you can

996
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,560
analyze it

997
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,800
another basic tool

998
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,230
grip

999
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,079
[Laughter]

1000
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,440
yeah so grep is a tool that lets you

1001
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
search large files

1002
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
for data

1003
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
it's a

1004
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,440
pure processing tool but that will say

1005
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,800
okay i can you type use a little bit of

1006
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,119
regex so i can use a little bit of

1007
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,480
formatting and search text uh i will

1008
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
guarantee you that in our bash games on

1009
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,480
hacker challenge there are

1010
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,000
two or three puzzles that can only be

1011
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
solved with graph or reading of two

1012
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,520
million lines of text so

1013
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,160
learn how to use grip

1014
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,560
um the power of your text editor

1015
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,359
is awesome uh whether it's vs code it's

1016
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,119
notepad plus plus or some lime text

1017
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,800
these are some of the three most

1018
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
powerful editors i've found

1019
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,079
there are others

1020
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,839
um but

1021
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,720
choose a really good text editor

1022
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
and learn its plugins learn its

1023
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
strengths learn how to use search and

1024
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
replace learn how to

1025
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
do advanced searching

1026
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,079
learn how to use its regex functions

1027
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,440
the the you will find that

1028
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,839
as you

1029
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,160
get to know your text editor

1030
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,359
that you'll become a lot more

1031
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,599
comfortable on cli and you'll become a

1032
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,920
lot more comfortable with being quick at

1033
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,640
things you process

1034
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
um i want to mention some of the

1035
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
collections so i'm sure many of you have

1036
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,520
heard of kali linux

1037
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,560
kali linux comes with

1038
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,200
hundreds and hundreds of tools

1039
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
with many of these peak compiled and

1040
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
built for you to use but it's not the

1041
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
only security distribution out there

1042
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,760
there's a lot of really good ones

1043
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
especially for some many of us that

1044
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
might not love the linux world or that's

1045
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,079
not where we're most comfortable we

1046
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,119
would prefer to point and click

1047
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,040
or a comfortable windows environment so

1048
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,320
in that case i strongly recommend the

1049
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,079
commando vm

1050
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
mandiant has published the this vm

1051
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
that's built on windows with multiple

1052
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
repositories and

1053
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,920
hundreds of tools built into it

1054
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,839
that runs great

1055
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,000
and so if you are wanting a windows

1056
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
environment to penetration test or to

1057
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
for a security distribution commando is

1058
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,880
great

1059
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,640
it's available on github and they

1060
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,599
release regular updates and

1061
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,960
basically it

1062
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
lets you you can they have two

1063
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,079
installation methods where you can

1064
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,920
download an image or you can have your

1065
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
own windows installation and have it

1066
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,960
updated install against it

1067
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,160
uh flare vm is another alternative and

1068
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,680
this one is focused particularly on

1069
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,040
incident response tools so this one will

1070
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,920
have things like autopsy and volatility

1071
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
uh pre-built into them

1072
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,839
uh that was my last slide i don't know

1073
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,240
what happened there's my deck so

1074
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,200
um

1075
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
flare vm commando vm kali linux are

1076
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
three of the great biggest collections

1077
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
of tools i found and that i fall in love

1078
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,520
with

1079
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,320
um

1080
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,400
and those are my daily hitters for

1081
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,760
security tools with security 101 tools

1082
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
that's about where i am on content for

1083
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
you today but i'd love to answer

1084
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
questions or walk through these tools

1085
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,320
you have questions on how to use them

1086
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,839
or love hear recommendations for your

1087
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,839
tools

1088
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
yes parallels i've really enjoyed in the

1089
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,960
past um i found on mac os for myself

1090
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,680
that

1091
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,800
i enjoyed vmware fusion for performance

1092
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,880
but parallels has worked great

1093
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,359
i've had troubles with it um sometimes

1094
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,359
in some of the linux distros i just it

1095
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,040
could just be me

1096
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,000
but yes thank you for mentioning

1097
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,480
parallels

1098
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,200
other questions about security tools or

1099
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,480
anything else you want me to try and

1100
