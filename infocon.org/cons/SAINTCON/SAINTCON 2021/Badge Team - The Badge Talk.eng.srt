1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
minutes ago so

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,240
this is going to go great

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
um do we need to talk about this

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
no those were for us you are supposed to

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
see that oh all right

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,200
all right

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,400
oh waylon you want to talk about this

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
one this is your stuff oh wow i'm

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
changing the order as you're going so i

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
guess that none of those made it ah i

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
don't know i can refresh it

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
oh yeah that's always slide eight now

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,079
yeah you start cool i'll start there's

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
the tv right there okay great all right

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
so

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
for those of you that haven't gone down

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
to the hhc i've got this exploded

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,800
version of the badge so you can see all

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,480
the internals and the layers and whatnot

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
without taking your badge apart please

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,920
don't take your badge apart it's really

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
easy to damage the internals damage the

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
screen we don't have extras

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,840
but yeah it is

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
four pcb layers there's five actual pcbs

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,000
because you know the one part the

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
shackle slides so it's separate

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,559
one of the really big challenges with

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
this is

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,760
the the thickness limitations inside the

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
badge so

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
a layer of normal pcb thickness is 1.6

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
millimeters it's not much to work with

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
and in the center we have two layers so

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,159
we got 3.2 millimeters to fit everything

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,759
inside this badge

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,600
the screen is 2.6 millimeters

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
which means all our components have a

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
height limitation of one millimeter

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
which

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
is ridiculous

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,520
it

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
spent so much time searching for chips

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,119
and everything and especially with the

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,640
chip shortage

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
trying to find stuff that would fit was

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
a huge challenge and we redesigned and

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
redesigned

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
and we'll go into some more of that

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
later but yeah that was a big challenge

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
with the hardware

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
by the way i wanted to do usbc

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,240
the usbc connector is more than 3.2

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,680
millimeters tall

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
so

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
we can couldn't use it unless we wanted

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,320
a third board in the middle and that

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,039
wasn't gonna happen

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
so budget thirty dollars a badge and

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,599
we accounted for tariffs this year

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
and

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
so we actually hit our budget

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,959
and yeah they were assembled in the us a

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
really awesome company called pcbx

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
they're in ohio and so yeah they did the

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
assembly for us which worked out really

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
well so we didn't have to try to

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
communicate with an offshore company and

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,160
try to send parts there and

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
yeah having a us company do it is

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,239
amazing

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
okay so the badge has a few games on it

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
i think the obvious one is the one on

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
the right where you

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
scroll around and um dodge i don't know

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,879
what they are coronaviruses and pick up

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
blue energy balls i don't know whatever

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,160
you can call it

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
you can pick up the vaccine as you dodge

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
the corona whatever and you're in a

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
spaceship make up your own story and

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,599
then the one on the right the left um is

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
actually a serial port terminal game so

84
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,080
if you connect to it over a

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,720
serial cdc connection then this is a

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
old-school roguelike turn-based game and

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,200
so you use the arrows and the space key

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
to move around and try to sneak through

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
this building without getting seen by

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,560
the guards

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
um so a lot of what you a lot of

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
questions we get is like what is this

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
machine this is a finished version of

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,560
that machine when you have options to

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
build parts with your smaller parts this

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
is what you're trying to build this

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
image is a little older because it's got

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
the older saint con logo we redid it

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
when uh when they redid the the sync on

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
logo but this is what you're trying to

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
build on your badge uh you can go on

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,799
and then you can build that like you'll

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,879
get parts rewards for doing different

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,000
entering different combos there was a

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
combo in one of our earlier slides and

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
you'll end up with a lot of parts

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
hopefully

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
i mean you probably won't end up with

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
exact parts you need but you can trade

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,120
you can go to trade screen and trade

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
badges or trade parts with other users

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
to get what you need

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
um however go ahead

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
however there are some bugs with that um

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,480
some of you have been blessed with 255

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
of some of the items uh that's the eprom

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,200
deciding not to save when i write to it

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,640
and when i read from it it just gives me

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639
ff so you guys benefit from that bug um

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
unfortunately the tr there's also a bug

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
with a trading where sometimes one badge

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,918
does not want to finish the

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,520
communication and the other one assumes

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,840
the communication is complete and so one

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,199
one side will complete the trade and the

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
other side won't complete the trade so

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,759
that means

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
one person doesn't trade anything and

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
the other person gets a free item and

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
loses something to the efferials so i'm

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
sorry about that one uh we may have a

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
bug fix for that one but that would

133
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
require reflashing all the badges and we

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
are not gonna do that so it'll be in the

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
code base when we release the code

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
that's that's a copy kit point okay go

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
ahead

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,880
how's this for me

139
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
all right so yeah we talked about chip

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
shortages

141
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
um we

142
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
i redesigned the hardware on this three

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
times i think

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
so

145
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
a little bit of backstory this was the

146
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
badge we planned for last year

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
we designed it last year in april and

148
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
may and then

149
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
the decision was made to have a virtual

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
conference and we didn't want to waste

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
this badge on the virtual conference

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
because it's meant for interaction

153
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,039
so

154
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
we kind of shelved it this year we

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
picked it up again and couldn't get the

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
same chips and redesigned and

157
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
it was a mess

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,160
so

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
we had some features that we wanted that

160
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
we couldn't get like uh we wanted an

161
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
accelerometer in it we couldn't get any

162
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,120
when we went to go build the badge we

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,400
can get them now but that's not helpful

164
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
yeah so with that redesign like we

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,880
planned on 2020 we got a lot of the dev

166
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,199
work done and then we got a new chip and

167
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,039
the new chip required a new development

168
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,320
environment and that new development

169
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
environment did not support c plus

170
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,199
so we had to rewrite a lot of the

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,600
object oriented code to be raw c code

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
pure c code to support this different

173
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
processor

174
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
also when we redesigned the chip

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
we used a different flash chip and we

176
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
realized that our new flash chip did not

177
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
support qspi which would allow us to

178
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
memory map that the flash and just be

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,319
able to read it since we couldn't do

180
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
that we needed to the display

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
to read from memory right right to a

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
frame buffer and then write that to the

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
screen that needed to be as fast as

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
possible and in our tests we were only

185
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
getting 10 to 12 frames per second which

186
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
wasn't fast enough and so

187
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
this is a picture of me looking at the

188
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
assembly code in that frame draw

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
function this loop is where it's

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
throwing stuff to the screen

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
and i was looking through there counting

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
each instruction like oh that multiply

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,160
instructions four clock cycles this you

194
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
know put load instructions two clock

195
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
cycles uh and like counting them like

196
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
okay i can move i can move the multiply

197
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
outside the loop i can move this outside

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,639
the loop to optimize that

199
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
draw frame so we did some some hand

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
rolled assembly to improve the frame

201
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
rate on this

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,720
all right so this is one thing i ran

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
into on the first new prototypes this

204
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,479
year

205
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
so if any of you have dealt with

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
any kind of chips and whatnot there's a

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,960
thing called an errata sheet and that

208
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
lists all the problems with the

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,000
different versions of silicon that the

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
manufacturer has produced

211
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
and it's not tied to the data sheet it's

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
not part of it you have to go search

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
this out separately and i failed to do

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
that and there was this nice little note

215
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
in there that says the internal pull-up

216
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
resistor for the reset line on the chip

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
doesn't work

218
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
small bug no big deal so our prototypes

219
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
had scabbed on resistors to make them

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
even work

221
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
so

222
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
yeah all kinds of fun stuff that you

223
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
find

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
here's some pictures of assembly

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
um

226
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
yeah lots of soldering we hand soldered

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,639
the screens and the battery packs and

228
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
the mini badge connectors

229
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,400
yeah so much assembly

230
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,560
oh this is my turn i finally get a slide

231
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,599
maybe i should have helped with this

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
um so

233
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
for the nfc

234
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,319
we

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
wanted a way for you to be able to go

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
around the conference do something and

237
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
then get an unlock for it and so

238
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
the way i came up with is i had these

239
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,559
little

240
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
pvc coated

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
tags

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
they're like knock off chinese versions

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,959
of the

244
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,560
amiibo tags

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
and so

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
i designed a cool sencon 3d printed

247
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
thing and then i

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
printed one of them i thought it looked

249
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
really nice

250
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
and i was going to do a huge batch of

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,279
them

252
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,440
because it requires you to pause the

253
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,839
print to put the tag in and then pause

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,000
the print to change the filament

255
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
to get the cool dual tone color

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,440
so

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
i decided

258
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
to do a batch and then the more i

259
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
thought about it i didn't want them all

260
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
to look the same so

261
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
each one took about an hour and required

262
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
me to be constantly there

263
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,800
and i decided to do this last week

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,399
so

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,760
we have

266
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
i printed this many tags they helped a

267
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
little bit but

268
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
yeah it took way longer than it should

269
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
have they look cool

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
but

271
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
yeah i would not recommend starting a

272
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
project for st khan the week before

273
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
saint con

274
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
we we don't have a slide on the nfc i

275
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
think you should talk about that too

276
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,440
okay

277
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
um

278
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,080
and so

279
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
we used

280
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
it was an stm chip for nfc yeah and

281
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
they had some data sheet that talked

282
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
about the communication protocol of how

283
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
to put things on

284
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,040
well how to tell the nfc chip what to do

285
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
but the real issue with that is it says

286
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
here send these bytes well

287
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
if you know anything about nfc you have

288
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
to know what bytes to send

289
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,839
and what

290
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,320
um frequency to use the channels things

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
like that

292
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
all

293
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
is

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
supported by the chip but it doesn't

295
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
tell you what exactly to do in the data

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,040
sheet so to understand how the nfc

297
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
worked we had two options

298
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
i learn everything there is to know

299
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
about nfc and write a custom library

300
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,560
or

301
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,160
we can use their provided code which was

302
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
poorly written and not documented and

303
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,680
would have taken a lot longer than

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
understanding how nfc works

305
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
to just get through their code base yeah

306
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,839
their code base was like here's a sample

307
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
to detect a

308
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
tag

309
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
and then like well you do with it past

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
that you're on your own bro but uh

311
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
there's a tag there and so we we

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
struggled with trying to decide to use

313
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,560
their library or start from scratch and

314
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
uh sodium here did you start from

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
scratch we did

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
from scratch there was also an issue

317
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,240
with their library where the chip has a

318
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
lot of weird bugs in it

319
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
for example talking to it to send an

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
acknowledgement packet in nfc

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
requires a specific command if you send

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
that command the way the

323
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
data sheet tells you to

324
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
it doesn't work

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
so the option is to

326
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
dig through their code base find the one

327
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
line that uses a reserve for future use

328
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,959
command

329
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
so it's not even documented

330
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,399
on how to send an acknowledgement

331
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,959
and then

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,760
another issue with that is the a lot of

333
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
the timings were just wrong in the data

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
sheet so a lot of stuff just has to wait

335
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,320
a lot longer than it should because the

336
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,399
chip just doesn't respond

337
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,399
and sometimes the chip gets in a state

338
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
where it just can't recover and it

339
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,000
doesn't tell you it's broken it just

340
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
acts like it's still there

341
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,560
so mike wasn't this chip like a redesign

342
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
of a previous chip yeah it was kind of

343
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,360
weird they had two different chips one

344
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
that could read and one that was a

345
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
writer and then they kind of combined

346
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
them into this other one but yeah

347
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
there's like multiple different

348
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,760
revisions that change names in the

349
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
middle and it's a mess and it really

350
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
feels like they just like took the two

351
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,639
documents and like put them together

352
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,160
like oh yeah that's totally how this one

353
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
works but uh it's not

354
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
so do you want to talk about the antenna

355
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
too

356
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
oh man i wish i had slides for that

357
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
so designing an nfc antenna is not for

358
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,880
the faint of heart

359
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,639
um

360
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,639
and even though it's not actually rf

361
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
it's induction based it's still

362
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
a mess so i used an online calculator

363
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
to say okay i've got this many turns

364
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,839
this diameter

365
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,519
this thickness of copper and it's like

366
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
yeah it should be this you know this

367
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
many micro henries and this resistance

368
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,399
and so then you design your

369
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,120
matching capacitor network for

370
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
the nfc chip and you put it all together

371
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
and then it doesn't work

372
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
and then i got a

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
vector network analyzer to test the

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
antenna and see what it actually came

375
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
out as and it was way off from what the

376
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,800
design tool said so then i redesigned

377
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
the tuning network again and it still

378
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
didn't work

379
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
so

380
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,920
it ended up being just hours and hours

381
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,800
of

382
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
trial and error

383
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,079
changing out capacitors seeing what

384
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,040
works

385
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
the network analyzer

386
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,399
turned out to be

387
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,120
fairly useless actually because

388
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
if any of you have seen how that works

389
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
and with the smith chart and you get the

390
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,279
little loop and you're supposed to put

391
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,560
it right in the middle

392
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,760
when it's right in the middle it doesn't

393
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
work

394
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,600
so it ends up being way off in left

395
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
field but it works now

396
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
we also ran into issues with different

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,040
phones have different nfc abilities

398
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
my phone apparently it's a samsung

399
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
galaxy something happens to be fairly

400
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
good at nfc and so

401
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,160
even with a weirdly tuned antenna it

402
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
worked great and these guys phones

403
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,760
didn't work at all i have an iphone it's

404
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
useless

405
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,040
um

406
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
so yeah there were all kinds of issues

407
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
with that and so

408
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
and especially with

409
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
sodium being

410
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,399
not living up here it was

411
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,240
fun trying to ship badges back and forth

412
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,040
and try things and between like the

413
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
redesigns and getting the antenna to

414
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
work and trying to write our own nfc

415
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
driver i think it was a week ago that we

416
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,720
finally got the nfc working yeah ready

417
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
and yes

418
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
and and threw that in the main branch so

419
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
we had like two days to test the nfc and

420
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
make it go

421
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
yeah it was kind of terrifying to be

422
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
that close to the conference and not

423
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,760
have working nfc which was the main

424
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
point of the badge yeah

425
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
and another issue was the only way to

426
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,440
know your nfc commands to this chip is

427
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
working because again the data sheet was

428
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,920
terrible was to

429
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
test it

430
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
and so

431
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
a lot of the stuff i did blind and then

432
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
it didn't work so

433
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
when he finally finished how one was the

434
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
final design shipped to me that i could

435
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
actually read uh

436
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,720
two weeks ago yeah yeah mostly nfc has

437
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,680
been written in two weeks

438
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
all right this one's yours um and then

439
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,360
we

440
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
so in the past there's always been

441
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
issues with mini badges talking to the

442
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,720
main badge it hasn't worked very well

443
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
because

444
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
the first year

445
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
there was

446
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
a thing saying we have

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,920
spi and i2c

448
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,800
and

449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
well the badge didn't do anything with

450
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,839
it even though it was connected the

451
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,320
second year he published some documents

452
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,040
on it and then they got working and

453
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,639
realized that it didn't work very well

454
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,959
so then they changed the spec a little

455
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
bit but forgot to update the public spec

456
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
so then people showed up with mini

457
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
badges that still didn't work and would

458
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,920
crash the main badge

459
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
and then this next year

460
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
so the enigma badge

461
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
we

462
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
he

463
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
made it work in theory

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
with some devices

465
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,399
it still followed the spec a little bit

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
from the previous year

467
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
but just a little bit and so people's

468
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,279
mini badges didn't work again and so i

469
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,800
decided there needed to be something

470
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,639
about that i joined the badge team i

471
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,000
decided to do this to myself and

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,519
redefine the spec

473
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,560
and

474
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,199
wrote a ton of example code of how to

475
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
get a mini badge to talk to the main

476
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,839
badge

477
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,160
um yeah and when's your

478
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,959
uh

479
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,440
today at one in cascade e i'll be

480
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
talking about

481
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
how to get that communication working

482
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
and a great tool that i made

483
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,359
and got delayed in china so

484
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
i have some

485
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
they'll probably be in the store

486
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
tomorrow at the rate we're going yeah so

487
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
you created this really cool dev board

488
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,679
for designing mini badges and testing

489
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,760
communication and all that good stuff so

490
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
you can verify your design before the

491
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
conference and as long as it works with

492
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,959
that you should be confident that'll

493
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,799
work with the badge as long as the badge

494
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,679
talks yep

495
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
and then we also added the clock pin so

496
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
that's

497
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
a little bit of extra software we did

498
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
that what like

499
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
saturday on sunday yeah we got that

500
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
working on the badge sunday but it was

501
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,000
pretty easy but then now you can have

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
interactive mini badges

503
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
overall there were some nice changes

504
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
because it made it so we had to care

505
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,120
about

506
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
less on the mini badge spec

507
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,039
because a lot of the code was written

508
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,120
beforehand so that made this nice

509
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,280
all right

510
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
is this the last slide yeah

511
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,160
okay so i have a video for you guys

512
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,360
so last year when i was designing the

513
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
badge

514
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
i decided to screen capture my design

515
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,240
process

516
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,360
um

517
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
so this goes through the first two

518
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
prototypes that i did last year

519
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,039
it's about 30 hours worth of video

520
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,919
and

521
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
it's condensed into about five minutes

522
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,880
so i will try to kind of talk about this

523
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
as

524
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
it's going

525
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,000
so fusion 360 is how i design the the

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
board stack and everything

527
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
um

528
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
got that out

529
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
and put that into kycad to get the the

530
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
outlines and everything

531
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
um

532
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
one thing you'll notice as we're going

533
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,440
through this is me scrolling through

534
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,880
data sheets

535
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
so many data sheets

536
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
i mean the main chip is

537
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,400
the data sheet is 1500 pages something

538
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
like that

539
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,039
and then there's all the other chips

540
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,120
that have their 100 plus page data

541
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
sheets

542
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,799
right and so

543
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,240
so much time

544
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
so many data sheets

545
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,360
um

546
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
at one point we were looking at a

547
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,799
physical switch to detect the

548
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,360
shackle opening and closing

549
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,799
we ended up scrapping that idea because

550
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
trying to find a switch that has long

551
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
enough travel without you being able to

552
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
crush the switch

553
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
when you're opening or closing it is

554
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
tough because you have to have

555
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
fairly loose tolerances with

556
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
circuit boards and their outlines aren't

557
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
always perfect

558
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
and trying to get something to fit with

559
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,320
that was a challenge

560
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,559
i saw slack overflow in there oh yeah

561
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,039
yep so

562
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,679
all right this is when i actually

563
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
started getting into laying out the

564
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,678
board

565
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
and just constantly back and forth to

566
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,158
data sheets

567
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,400
it's sad because a lot of these parts

568
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,919
that you're referencing here aren't in

569
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,000
this product anymore oh no yeah this was

570
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
last year the first design that we

571
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
basically scrapped so we had to do this

572
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,000
all again yeah i kept the you know the

573
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
board shape and outline and everything

574
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,678
and then replaced all the electronics

575
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,039
yeah and here again was trying to fit

576
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
everything within that one millimeter

577
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
thickness under the screen

578
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
oh tell me so the accelerometer never

579
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
made it but um you want to talk about

580
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
the hairdo you had to do on the uh yeah

581
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,640
so

582
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,159
when we were first designing this right

583
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,360
i had measured the screens and

584
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
everything i'm like okay i got one

585
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
millimeter and the accelerometer i could

586
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,120
find at the time was 1.1 millimeters

587
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
thick it's like okay we'll try it on the

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
prototype right it might work might not

589
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
stick the screen in and it's got a big

590
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
spot in it where the

591
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
accelerometer was i was like i wonder

592
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
how thick the case on the accelerometer

593
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,919
is so i took sandpaper to it and i

594
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,919
shaved off a tenth of a millimeter off

595
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,159
the top of the accelerometer and it

596
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,200
still worked

597
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,919
but

598
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,200
there was no way we could do that on

599
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,080
1100 of them

600
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,640
so we scrapped that and then yeah this

601
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,760
year we couldn't even get accelerometers

602
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
just for an idea regarding like the chip

603
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
shortage like you guys i'm sure you guys

604
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
hear it all the time right i have a

605
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
palette of like

606
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,880
50 of these stmf f1l somethings and when

607
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
i bought them they sold for like a

608
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
dollar or three each so i was like you

609
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
know 50 bucks worth of chips but last

610
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,720
year i looked online and they were

611
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
selling for 26 each

612
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,679
it's crazy the markup on these these

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,919
chips like they just disappear

614
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,280
right and they cater to the large

615
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
vendors first so like badge makers like

616
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
us who only want to buy a thousand to

617
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
100 of something we're kind of the

618
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
lowest guy on the totem pole

619
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,799
and it's uh it's difficult to get what

620
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,840
you want

621
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
i was talking with a arrow vendor the

622
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,080
other day and he was telling me one of

623
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,520
his tips is 72 weeks lead time that's a

624
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,918
year and a half

625
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,240
wait i think that's more than a year

626
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,880
isn't it no yeah

627
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
yep

628
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
all right

629
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,240
so this is my second redesign where i

630
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,200
went through and changed everything

631
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
yeah that's the the touch wheel on the

632
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200
front

633
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
you can see the the rings for the nfc

634
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,520
antenna out there

635
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,480
all right i guess that's the end of that

636
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
um

637
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
by the way designing touch wheels as

638
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
well not super simple

639
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,440
i designed this one it didn't work well

640
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
at all and then i designed the new one

641
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
and it was close enough and we didn't

642
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
have time to redo it

643
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,919
so there's

644
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
there's a really ugly look-up table in

645
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,919
the badge for the touch wheel

646
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
that makes it a little more linear

647
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,919
but if you'll notice

648
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,840
if you're playing with it there's some

649
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,960
big jumps as you're going around

650
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
because there's just not enough

651
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
resolution in the touch controller

652
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
and

653
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
the design of it we really just needed

654
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
more than three segments

655
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,520
and

656
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
didn't we use every single pin the chip

657
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
had every single pin is used on the chip

658
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
um

659
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,320
and speaking of capacitive touch

660
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
if any of you have looked at the

661
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
exploded one you notice the shackle

662
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,480
opening and closing there's no physical

663
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
switch

664
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
we use capacitive touch for that

665
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
so if you have a chance go down the hhc

666
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
and look at it there are four capacitive

667
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,679
touch

668
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,000
pads on the bottom board there are some

669
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
matching ones up on the shackle and

670
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
there's also an extra one in there

671
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,279
that's not part of the shackle you guys

672
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
should take a look at that and maybe see

673
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,279
what can be done with that

674
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,760
do we want to talk more about that or is

675
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,159
that enough of it that's up to you yeah

676
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,600
all right you may give him a little more

677
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
it's wednesday yeah so you know there's

678
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,840
lots of soda cans lying around and it's

679
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
a really nice thin piece of metal

680
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,279
and

681
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,200
there may be something in the badge that

682
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
could be done with that i mean it is a

683
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
lock right

684
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
maybe all it's a physical security

685
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
company right we're focusing on physical

686
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
security this time right so we tried to

687
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
mike tried to make it uh much like a

688
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,159
real lock with the same attack

689
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,559
available yeah maybe i'll go talk to the

690
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,159
lockpick community about it there you go

691
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,880
talk to them yeah

692
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
okay you guys got anything else got

693
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,400
questions yeah questions please

694
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
so the badge

695
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
hypothetically someone tried to rewrite

696
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
the nfc on it

697
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,120
and then your contact information

698
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
disappears

699
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,240
how do you re-flash the nfc on

700
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
i'm surprised you're able to get the

701
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
contact information

702
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
there's like a magic string that needed

703
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,000
to be in there for to rewrite that

704
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
so you should you should you should get

705
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,919
the schedule and then you have to open

706
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,640
the class to get the v card

707
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
okay yeah we could try to reflash that

708
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
um and fix it

709
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,679
but that's impressive

710
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,320
sorry i guess he didn't have a mic his

711
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
question was um he broke the v card by

712
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
writing nfc to it and that's what he he

713
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,080
asked how he can fix that

714
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
okay oh there it goes um so my biggest

715
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
question is what

716
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,360
in your decision like because there are

717
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
lots of

718
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
i guess different options we could have

719
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
gone with uh like i guess my thing is

720
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
like a raspberry pi mini or an arduino

721
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
or something like that that has a lot

722
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
more

723
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,919
i guess build behind it what was the

724
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,480
decision for you guys to do your own

725
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
chips and do your own programming there

726
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
opposed to using something that's more

727
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,679
mature or even developed in that area

728
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,480
um

729
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
it's a great question so

730
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,559
things we run into arduino is great

731
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,720
if you're using one of their

732
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
exact models that they fully support

733
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,600
otherwise you're on whatever community

734
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,840
support is based around the chip for it

735
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,279
the other thing is arduino doesn't

736
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,039
really have debugging

737
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,080
which is a huge thing so when you're

738
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,159
using you know the manufacturer's ide

739
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,919
you get actual step through debugging

740
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,799
and so that's a big thing for

741
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,720
why we don't go with arduino

742
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,159
raspberry pi stuff is super expensive

743
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,640
um and hard to get in large quantities

744
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,279
it also kills batteries really fast

745
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,919
there was a saint kanye that did the the

746
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,480
raspberry pi and troy pulled a lot of

747
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,279
strings to get that many raspberry pies

748
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
at one time and it was basically like

749
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,559
yeah that's not happening again

750
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
so first of all thank you this is the

751
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,559
badge is amazing i love how it

752
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,679
integrates with everything like it

753
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,200
integrates with all the different

754
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,440
villages or whatever and uh it's just a

755
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,880
really fun badge that integrates with

756
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,279
the rest of st khan but my question is

757
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,559
is there anything cool that happens when

758
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
you build the machine is it just kind of

759
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
personal gratification or is there

760
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
something special that unlocks you yeah

761
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,559
that's that's really all it is um

762
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,640
we didn't make it to that like uh

763
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
there was thoughts but we never made it

764
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,080
past that so you don't feel obligated to

765
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
build it at all but uh that's that's all

766
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
there is to it sorry

767
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,279
it looks really cool though you did a

768
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,559
great job on it yes

769
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,039
other questions

770
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,039
or complaints you know we'll take those

771
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
too yeah yeah i mean feedback is very

772
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
welcome so yeah make the same mistakes

773
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,799
every year yep

774
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,720
so that's something else really quick so

775
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,559
in other years we've had like there's

776
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,399
been a lot more badge assembly for like

777
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,640
the actual like attendees

778
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
versus like this year where a lot of it

779
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
was already pre-done is there any plans

780
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,279
in the future to

781
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,600
kind of bring it back to more

782
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
that like attendee

783
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,279
assembly versus pre-assembly stuff are

784
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,279
you saying you like assembly yourself

785
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,480
yeah okay

786
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,200
yeah so that is actually in the works

787
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,000
for

788
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,240
hopefully next year a little more arts

789
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,039
and crafts badge

790
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,200
it's been talked about because

791
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,919
poor troy he

792
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,880
is

793
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,679
i've taken over his house every year

794
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,880
for like a week doing assembly and

795
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,039
him and a bunch of committee members

796
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,559
coming over there and assembling badges

797
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,679
for days

798
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,840
so yeah we're gonna hopefully

799
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,240
go to more attendee assembly in the

800
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,440
future

801
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
but you know here again we get lots of

802
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
complaints the other way of i don't want

803
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
to solder this i don't have time for

804
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,039
this why do i have to do this

805
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,000
so yeah we'll try to switch it up and do

806
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,520
a little more of that next year maybe

807
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,279
have a minimal functioning badge without

808
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,159
solder but add-on options oh yeah that'd

809
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
be cool another trade-off

810
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
that we have to make is

811
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,360
if we want to make

812
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
something you can solder yourself

813
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,279
traditionally there have been

814
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,600
pre-built boards that

815
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,919
you have to assemble together which is

816
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,840
really big and bulky

817
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,240
or uh you have to go with

818
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,440
um

819
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,240
what already exists and

820
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,919
traditionally those

821
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
boards are not

822
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,360
as power friendly

823
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
they're meant for develop well for

824
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
prototyping and then

825
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
that's it

826
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,159
they're not

827
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,600
they're a do all

828
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
and

829
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,080
if you want your badge to last

830
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
doing

831
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
surface mount keeping it small

832
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,320
tends to be a little bit better

833
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,520
at least in my experience

834
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,360
do you guys have any

835
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,240
chips

836
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,840
that you really want to use on a badge

837
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,640
but you haven't been able to force in

838
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,279
by you know for any reason yeah sorry no

839
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
secrets

840
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,120
this this year i really wanted to use

841
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,519
the new raspberry pi

842
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
not the uh the 2040. yeah

843
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
pico that's the one

844
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,640
but getting them in quantity wasn't an

845
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
option

846
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,679
it is now but

847
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,399
months ago it wasn't an option so

848
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,840
maybe maybe next year who knows

849
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,679
all right

850
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,360
any other questions

851
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,240
we got one back there

852
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,159
mainly for the videos it'll be up on

853
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,799
youtube later

854
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,320
so i've gotten two unlock codes so far

855
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,799
and both of them shared two numbers is

856
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,320
that a coincidence or is there some kind

857
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,480
of a pattern that i can figure out to

858
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
get more unlocked codes the the

859
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,440
combination unlock codes yeah um so they

860
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,919
are valid master lock

861
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,200
unlock codes

862
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
um and master lock unlock codes do have

863
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,559
a certain pattern

864
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,799
but there's no more uh similarity

865
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,240
between the numbers than that so you

866
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,080
shouldn't be able to deduce one from

867
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,799
another sure okay um but i will i've

868
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,120
said this to a few others the badge when

869
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,880
you're entering the numbers after you

870
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
enter the first number

871
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,399
if you're like one off on the second

872
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,440
number and then you move it will fix the

873
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
second number to one of the known combos

874
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,519
so it's gonna cheat for you a little bit

875
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
if you're trying to enter a wrong combo

876
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,360
and it keeps changing it for you that

877
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,720
might be a good hint that that's not a

878
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
combo okay so

879
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
uh that that may help you to do some

880
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
more but that's not the intended method

881
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
but nonetheless i'm not gonna stop you

882
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,919
from trying sure thanks

883
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
cool anyone else when you guys are

884
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,440
working

885
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
when you guys are trying to work

886
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,279
together how much because you all are so

887
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,159
competent how much do you have to avoid

888
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,880
stepping on each other's process

889
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,760
i

890
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,279
don't think we

891
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,120
do i don't know yeah i didn't feel like

892
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,559
there was any much of stepping on

893
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,320
anybody else it was mainly like whoever

894
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
can get to this first let's just do it

895
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,360
yeah yeah so much development work to do

896
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,519
yes whoever had some time

897
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,279
jump on it and get it done obviously

898
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,480
each of us have kind of some core

899
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,159
competencies and so we just kind of did

900
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,840
what we know best but the areas which

901
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,519
kind of overlapped it was just whoever

902
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,640
got to it first just did it yep

903
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
do you ever get that when you're

904
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,840
actually working

905
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
or is it just when you're doing hobbyist

906
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,519
work

907
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
no i yeah i get that like overlap on i

908
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,679
don't know sorry can you ask the

909
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
question again when when you're at work

910
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,679
do you feel like there's there's better

911
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,159
flow between hobbyist projects that you

912
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,559
want to work on or do you feel like

913
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,600
there's more overstep when it comes to

914
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
clocking in and having to do something

915
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,559
for me the experience is the same the

916
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,559
guys i work with um

917
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,279
they're

918
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,280
top quality as well so right so we i

919
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,639
think i feel like we work well maybe

920
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
they don't feel the same about me but um

921
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
i feel like that they do

922
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,839
cool anywhere else

923
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,359

924
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,359
