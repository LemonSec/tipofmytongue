1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
they took this you'll see it with lpl

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,439
stuff they took it to a whole nother

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,520
level of amazingness with this top down

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,600
camera um

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
super legit i'm excited about it

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
so

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
oh they didn't mention compukid mike

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,759
made the defcon badge too right like

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,960
utah we bat way above our weight in the

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
infosec community so we're saying like

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,320
hey this is the cool badge at st con

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
that's the same badge maker makes a

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
defcon badge just saying

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
all right so this is me i'm james pope

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
everybody just calls me pope which was

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
nice and easy because i had a weird last

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,440
name no matter what hacker handle i

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
tried it just ended up with that

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
um it did get a little more complicated

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,480
because i got some brothers here with

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
the same last name they got to have

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
their own handle so i'm just still pope

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
i've been doing st con committee since

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
2015

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,920
in the av did it with kevin howard

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
and uh i sit in the black cat and knock

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
as a team lead

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
so you'll find me there actually flying

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
out to europe in two weeks to do the

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
europe show i helped start and run with

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
a lot of really good folks dc435 which

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,239
is up in cache valley

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,799
also came from salt lake so dc801 i'm

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,960
never giving up ownership of that so i

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,000
participate in that and then i help

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
bryce coons run b-side salt lake as well

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
here in salt lake or

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
that way in salt lake

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
all right so when i was putting together

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
this talk

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
i went back and looked at all the past

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
talks i've done

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
and just from morbid curiosity i was

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,159
like what's the first talk i ever did on

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
infosec this is an actual slide deck

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
from it it was a security awareness

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
training talk i've taken out the org's

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
name that it worked for

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
but it was in movie theaters that'll be

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,040
prevalent as we start to go um and

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,119
i started like looking at all the

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,759
content that was in this slide deck and

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,159
it was things like fishing and spear

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
fishing things like patch management and

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
social engineering

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
and what i realized was

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,360
all the things that

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
are in that deck is the exact same

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
things today

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
right like i could almost get up not

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
that i mean we're all in security and

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
you don't want to sit through security

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
awareness training and you know people

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
in security

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,959
because that's not super fun because you

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,160
already know you're preaching to the

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
choir

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
but

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
it was it was a lot the same so i'm

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
looking back from a decade before and i

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,760
realize

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
we're just staring at ourselves right

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,400
like

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
this is literally the same things we're

75
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
talking about a year a decade later like

76
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
an entire decade

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
and

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
oh one caveat one caveat this part right

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
here i used to front load the front of

80
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
all of my presentations almost a third

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
of it just talking about why security

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
matters

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
this part has absolutely changed

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
i now have neighbors

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,239
six-year-old neighbors four-year-old all

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,519
my neighbors are coming over telling me

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,640
about hey

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
colonial pipeline got ransomware and gas

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,519
prices are going up or hey microsoft

90
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
helped me with support and i think i

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
lost 400

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
right

93
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
why security matters

94
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,159
is built in now everybody understands it

95
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,599
i still have conversations with people

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,879
about

97
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,920
things like

98
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
you know do i care if somebody has my

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,519
information we get into weird privacy

100
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
conversations that still happens but

101
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
this part has absolutely changed besides

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,800
that

103
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,239
we're still doing this we're staring at

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
ourselves from a decade later of a lot

105
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
of the same stuff and when i realized

106
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
that i actually got kind of depressed

107
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
about it

108
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
right i'm like this is my job this is

109
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
what i'm doing and we're still talking

110
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
about the same things and i legitimately

111
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
like it like it like bent my head right

112
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
i was like wrapped around like

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
just really like frustrated thinking

114
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
about all these scenarios of how are we

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
still going over the same things a

116
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
decade later

117
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,560
right

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
and

119
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
i started writing like a talk that was

120
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,000
like super negative

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
like all the ways you could get breached

122
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
like it started just spiraling in weird

123
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,280
directions and it was all just ended up

124
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
being more negative than positive like

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
turning into twitter right where it's

126
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,840
like

127
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
and and rightfully so security kind of

128
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
is that and it's actually the reason i

129
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
love it is there's always new things new

130
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,040
vulnerabilities but it's usually like if

131
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
you look at it from a peer defender side

132
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,080
it's like here's something else you have

133
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
to deal with you got to go patch

134
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
something else hey that you know you

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
thought it was just os now it's computer

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
chips you know now it's you know your

137
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
bios and all you know all these other

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
things new bypass today of microsoft

139
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
surface you know security right like

140
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
just new things over and over and over

141
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
and so yeah i was building out this

142
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
thing that wasn't like the most ideal it

143
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,759
was just more

144
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
negative than positive and that's not

145
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
something that i wanted to do

146
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
so

147
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
i thought like what what is the time in

148
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,280
my life

149
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
that correlated to this like i've had

150
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
situations like this before where i

151
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
started getting really negative about

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
things

153
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,479
and you know how did i break out of

154
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
those so to tell this whole story i

155
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,840
gotta start from the beginning and the

156
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,000
beginning is at one point in my life i

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
started this company and we did camera

158
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
security

159
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
right like we're installing camera

160
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
systems all over chicago to canada to

161
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
whatever we were just being shipped

162
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
around uh putting in cameras this is a

163
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
legit picture that is will on the top of

164
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
that ladder and he was up there for like

165
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
six hours

166
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
right like

167
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
yeah and my brother larry as well in

168
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
here and so we did these camera security

169
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
companies and part of that was it was

170
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
all just availability right i didn't

171
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,880
know anything about security i mean i

172
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
knew some things i'd installed some

173
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
systems but it it wasn't a thought it

174
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
was all availability i was completely

175
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
focused around availability and as such

176
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
we'd get a camera system installed and

177
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
then we would you know punch holes

178
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
through firewalls so that way we could

179
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
you know get an activex on internet

180
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
explorer 6 to

181
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,199
run it's not a joke that was a real

182
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,320
thing

183
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,840
we used to do that

184
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
right and so we would we we didn't care

185
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
about security we're just making things

186
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
work and that turned into all sorts of

187
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
other weird i.t things

188
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
when you help a customer is one thing

189
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,240
and you can log into their firewall

190
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
suddenly it's like oh could you do b c d

191
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
e f g and it turned into all sorts of it

192
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,080
things

193
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,319
racks and installing things and

194
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,400
whatever was needed we just started like

195
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
building that out helping people with

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
all their general i.t

197
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
part of that

198
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
i had a customer who said hey uh he

199
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
called me james so james my first name

200
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
hey james uh can we

201
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,680
do this pci compliance

202
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,960
that

203
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,479
the credit card brands are asking me to

204
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,360
do

205
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
and i was like i don't i don't know

206
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
anything about any of that

207
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
right

208
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
and he's like well can you look into it

209
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
sure so i go i go home and google's the

210
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,319
pc i i'm gonna call it duck it now we're

211
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
ducking it duck.go i went home and i

212
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
ducked it and uh

213
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
i

214
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,240
i

215
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
researched and saw what came with pci

216
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,080
and my immediate reaction was like no no

217
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
no no no

218
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
i don't do that pci this thing looks

219
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
like a dumpster fire is a mess i don't

220
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
want to touch it i don't want to do it

221
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
and

222
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
and he said okay fine sure

223
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,319
like a month later he came back and he's

224
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
like hey uh i really like your help with

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,479
this pci compliance and i was like

226
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,319
didn't you find somebody else i told you

227
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
i'm not qualified i don't understand it

228
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
i don't know anything about pci and it

229
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,199
looks like a mess and he's like

230
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
i really want you to do it

231
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
come to find out i had a really cheap

232
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
rate at the time i just didn't know it

233
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
was 35 an hour right like i didn't know

234
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
i didn't know um so i said all right

235
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
i'll greet you if you pay me to research

236
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,759
pci understand it and if i don't deliver

237
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
it properly i still get paid for the

238
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
hours on the research

239
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
fine okay so i spent a bunch of time uh

240
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
did doing pci we did a full i think was

241
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
like sac d

242
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
and we get through it and they bring an

243
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
external auditor and the external error

244
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,599
comes in and they look at everything and

245
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,479
they're like

246
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
all but this one thing you missed this

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
one thing part of that was policy

248
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
creation and other things but we did

249
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
this one thing and after that one thing

250
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
they cleared and passed through pci

251
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
compliance and my learning curve of

252
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
security went from punching holes in

253
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
firewalls for ie6 for activex to run

254
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
make sure you click allow you got to

255
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
click allow all the things

256
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
my learning curve is security started

257
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,960
shooting up and i started to catch this

258
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
little bit of bug of infosec

259
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
this little part of like

260
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
hey you know there's a whole other side

261
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
besides just availability

262
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,360
we should probably secure some things

263
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
right

264
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
and that led to me going to the company

265
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,039
i worked at

266
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
and saying like hey we

267
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
we take a lot of credit cards

268
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,599
we should be doing a lot of these things

269
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,199
at the time i don't know if it was

270
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,720
around the time it came out or maybe it

271
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
was before and i just got access to it

272
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,440
this thing called lucidchart that i

273
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
thought was like the most amazing thing

274
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
ever and so

275
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,399
um a little bit of this story will lead

276
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
to that what happened was i went to my

277
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
boss and i was like hey all these pci

278
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
compliance things and uh i was had him

279
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
on the phone call and he was like

280
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
i don't understand what you're saying

281
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
i don't understand either this much like

282
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
my reaction when i first looked at pci

283
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
like no

284
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
this is a mess

285
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,519
and he's like maybe you need to type it

286
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
up for me so i still have it i couldn't

287
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
it was all redacted when i tried to get

288
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,360
a screenshot of it but

289
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
an entire email talking about all the

290
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
things in pci that needed to get

291
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
accomplished and i ship it over to him

292
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
i'm really proud of this work

293
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
and he's like i don't understand any of

294
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,959
this right like this is still a mess and

295
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,880
so i had the idea let's take lucidchart

296
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
i'm going to make a flow chart this is

297
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
the actual flowchart i made in 2011.

298
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
the org name is blocked out i'm sure i

299
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
could do a better one today

300
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
but funny enough i had i had this whole

301
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
side of like is the company willing to

302
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
change if no status quo

303
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,800
and then a whole bunch of things over

304
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
here that were more i.t related

305
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
including like maybe legitimate windows

306
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
you know keys and stuff and then on the

307
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
left hand side was like pci compliance

308
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
and this is required and if you don't

309
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,040
you're going to pay fines and then i

310
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
looked at the stuff we were doing and

311
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
the stuff we weren't and i created like

312
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
this really short list of like

313
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
all right well maybe we need not default

314
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
credentials and maybe we actually need a

315
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,440
policy that says we're doing pci right

316
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
maybe we actually need to get some cisco

317
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,160
training because i don't know what i'm

318
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
doing on that right

319
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,640
um

320
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,080
different unique ids maybe we shouldn't

321
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
all log in with the same credentials so

322
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,320
i went through all of it and tried to

323
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,079
find the differences and listed it out

324
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
and at the end of the day i was like you

325
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,200
know i'm just going to list all the

326
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
references of pci at the bottom just so

327
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
that way i'm covered right so this is my

328
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
actual this is like a gif of me make of

329
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
bumping through it but this is like

330
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
legitimately and you'll even see like

331
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
the date stamp in the far right this is

332
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
2011 like a decade ago that's insanity

333
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
to me to think about

334
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
and so i delivered this

335
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
and it got forwarded up because people

336
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
actually understood big red things that

337
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
said required and large fines

338
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
right so i delivered it and it went all

339
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,920
the way up to the executives

340
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
and then i got in a lot of trouble

341
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
i got a lot of trouble at the time i was

342
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
like a director of operations running

343
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,800
movie theaters multiple locations and i

344
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
did i t i stood up some point of sale

345
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
systems like

346
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
and then obviously camera systems right

347
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
but i got a lot of trouble jump there's

348
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,920
people who are responsible for

349
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
it and it wasn't me

350
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
and they were not happy with this

351
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,079
right and instead of being like yeah we

352
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,680
should improve some of these things and

353
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
how do we work towards this they just

354
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,160
got told like no we're doing that

355
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,200
and

356
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
you're a young kid from utah and stay in

357
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,000
your lane essentially that's maybe my

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,279
interpretation of it those words weren't

359
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,320
exact but multiple calls where i was

360
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
wrong and they were right

361
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,120
even though i was like hey i'm

362
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,399
overseeing a lot of these buildings and

363
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
i guarantee we're not doing that anyway

364
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,760
regardless it got to a point where i was

365
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
like just just leave me alone i'm going

366
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
to keep around the theaters you guys do

367
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
whatever

368
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
i'm going to do that on the side

369
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
consulting

370
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,519
i think the laptop this is what i'm

371
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,279
talking too much

372
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,839
a single slide all right

373
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
so then i get a call

374
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
it's like a friday i remember i was like

375
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
in the theater tearing tickets and i get

376
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,000
a call and they're like do you know

377
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
what's going on with these buildings

378
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
and i'm like no i have no i have no idea

379
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
right that's not my building and they're

380
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
like uh they're saying we need a pfi

381
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
and my immediate response was oh you got

382
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
breached

383
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
and then attacks how did you know that

384
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,639
how did you know he got breached i'm

385
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
like well you said pfi that's a pci

386
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
forensic investigator you want to talk

387
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
about that learning curve of pca i got

388
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
nerdy like i've printed those things out

389
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
i was reading them i was living

390
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
breathing pci i was thinking maybe i

391
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
could make a lot of money charging 35 an

392
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,519
hour to do pci

393
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,399
right

394
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
i was reading so i knew exactly what pfi

395
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
meant and they're like okay well uh the

396
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
brands mastercard telling us we got to

397
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
get that we don't know what to do and

398
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
the links they sent us were the same

399
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,079
links that were in the bottom of your

400
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,670
flow chart

401
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,040
[Music]

402
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
and i was like yeah pci so i immediately

403
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
pivoted people covering my stuff and i

404
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,160
had to go hire uh ir team forensic team

405
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
that was you know certified we get on

406
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
site

407
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
and i'm meeting with these guys and you

408
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
know confirming the breach yep total

409
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,959
total breach just so you know because

410
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,720
i'm dirty and i like that stuff came in

411
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
through pc anywhere

412
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
remember that came in through pc and er

413
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,639
some default creds server

414
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
effect terminals

415
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
and uh the credit card swipes and

416
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
they're finally moving off we'll chat

417
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,160
about that in a minute um they're just

418
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
key loggers right it's a usb keylogger

419
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,399
literally if you open up notepad and

420
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,600
swipe your credit card just prints out

421
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
your credit card information

422
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,839
so

423
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,279
they were just every time you swiped a

424
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,720
card it was just saving it to a text

425
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
file called it was like something stupid

426
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
like one.txt or something and then it

427
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,959
was sending those all to the server the

428
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,880
server is batching them to an ftp server

429
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,279
like every hour like hey we want to make

430
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,040
sure we get this every hour send out

431
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
credit cards so confirm breach

432
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
and i get there and i'm chatting with

433
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
the guy and i you know i talk a lot

434
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
right so i was like earful of this guy

435
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
i'm like in his ear what's happening

436
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
what's this thing doing and by the end

437
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
of i hear him on the phone with his boss

438
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
in the other room's like like dude these

439
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
guys have it they they have he has the

440
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,839
freaking pci like printed out and he's

441
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
referencing things about it that i don't

442
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
even know right and so i was like okay

443
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
like my learning curve my little bit of

444
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,399
bug for ir and forensics all

445
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,480
shot up i then had to turn around and

446
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
secure that environment

447
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
and so i don't know if anybody's ever

448
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
got youtube certified that's where half

449
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
your screen on your laptop in the back

450
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
room is youtube and the other half's

451
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
your cisco terminal

452
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,839
and

453
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
you're trying things and then nmap to

454
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,199
validate it no that didn't work trying

455
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,959
things and then you learn the hard

456
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,800
lesson of what a running config and a

457
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
save config is

458
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
after you get it all working and you

459
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
reboot it for those who don't know and

460
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
you reboot your cisco device plug it or

461
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,839
otherwise and you lose everything you

462
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,920
did if you don't save it

463
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,680
learn that lesson so yeah learning curve

464
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
shot up everything goes up and it turns

465
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,480
into

466
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,399
securing the site becoming a director of

467
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,320
i.t moving out of operations going full

468
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,639
into it and start doing presentations

469
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,800
that are required by pci like why does

470
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,199
security matter internally it turns in

471
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,519
even bigger i start doing it for the

472
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,079
industry i start presenting for

473
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
movie theater other exhibitors and

474
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
you know people who make the content

475
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,199
going to industry events and i'm

476
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,680
presenting on security and not my words

477
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
because i'm a smart enough security

478
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
professional to never say these words

479
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
but other people's words

480
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,839
you have the most secure theater chain

481
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
in north america

482
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
and that was primarily because we were

483
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,800
not proactive we got breached right and

484
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
so then spend was there time was there

485
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,720
people were on board because we already

486
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
dealt with this pain and at the time

487
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
2011 breach

488
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,079
everybody cared

489
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,680
like like now i think if that happened i

490
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
don't think anybody would be like

491
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
whatever like another breach but we had

492
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
like 17 police precincts and government

493
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,800
agencies and it was in we had to keep

494
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
hard drives for seven years of every

495
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
terminal like that stuff is now just

496
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
like whatever new can pave it let's go

497
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,360
everybody's getting wrecked

498
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
right so it's completely changed but so

499
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
i start doing these presentations on why

500
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,720
security matters in the industry and uh

501
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,079
at big events

502
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
and that led to that you know initial

503
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
slide deck

504
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
also um i decided after like five

505
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
locations because there's like 17 or

506
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,320
something i'm like pci sucks right like

507
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,079
i know i like it and it's a big learning

508
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,440
curve but it's a lot of freaking work

509
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
like a sac d at the time like 265

510
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
questions or something insane

511
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,560
and

512
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
i found these loopholes called

513
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
end-to-end encryption and i was like

514
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
wait what is this thing and it's like 10

515
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
questions you have to answer these 10

516
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
questions every year and i'm like yeah

517
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,759
i'm doing that so we moved we moved

518
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
everything to these verifone units in

519
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
2011. like you know just now everybody's

520
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,399
like

521
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
put in the chip bbb we did that long ago

522
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,920
because i was like i'm tired of this and

523
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,839
i actually proved out an roi going to

524
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
that instead of doing pci sac d

525
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,519
so anyway we end up that's how it most

526
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
secured because even if we're completely

527
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
breached there's no credit cards they're

528
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
all encrypted and verifone has the other

529
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,839
end of that key right

530
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
anyway so i'm trudging through pci for

531
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
lots of years

532
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
like three or so and i was like i wonder

533
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
if there's other people doing these

534
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,959
things

535
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,320
it just literally had never dawned on me

536
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
so much work in front of me just plowing

537
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
through it i'm like are other people

538
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
doing security in pci i would like to

539
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,920
talk to some of them so i google it duck

540
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
duck it dang it i duck it and uh the hit

541
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
comes back with defcon right and i'm

542
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
like oh that sounds cool and it already

543
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,400
just passed i'm like oh and then i found

544
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
saint con i'm like oh st con it's coming

545
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
up in like two weeks in october in weber

546
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
and i'm like all right i'm gonna try to

547
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,480
go to this so i put this proposal my

548
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
glass i'd like to go to st con get some

549
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,959
training get better at pci things

550
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,319
and he's like yeah i don't really see

551
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,000
the value of that

552
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
so back and forth back and forth i think

553
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
they they did agree to like okay we'll

554
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,199
pay half your time you pay the other

555
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
half but all meals travel all's on you

556
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
your car's on you okay so i got like two

557
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,760
days paid to go to st con i think i

558
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
think that's right 2014.

559
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,760
so i show up and yeah i i missed the

560
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
very beginning

561
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
so i didn't know who troy was i missed

562
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
this entry keynote because i got late

563
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
got there late because i was doing a job

564
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
and

565
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
so i didn't know troy was and yeah i was

566
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
ranting about the av that wasn't the

567
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
smartest move but um

568
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,320
got stuck doing av

569
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
it's been fun it's actually been great

570
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
doing that but what i did who i did meet

571
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
in the lobby when i first showed up was

572
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
metacortex

573
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,760
and uh

574
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
danny and he was there with 801 labs and

575
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,160
he's talking about all the things that

576
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
801 labs is doing

577
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
and i didn't i didn't understand the

578
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,440
vision like he explained it and i'm like

579
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,039
i don't i don't know if that's for me

580
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,559
right and so i left and he was like i

581
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,760
made some counterpoints he's like yeah

582
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,559
that sounds good so then i went uh into

583
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,480
uh presentations and when i tell you

584
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
when i went to my first saint con it was

585
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
like i just like found family it was

586
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
kind of weird and i was like super

587
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,480
nerding out like super tech guys up

588
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
there doing a presentation on like ir

589
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
evidence and i'm taking like pictures of

590
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
his slides

591
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
nerdy miles on fishing and you know just

592
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
watching all the things they're doing

593
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
and i'm like documenting them i mean

594
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
aaron toppings on like the math of

595
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
passwords and i moved to a password card

596
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,640
then and i still use it like insane like

597
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,160
how much i was just trying to soak in i

598
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
still like all these google notes uh

599
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,919
from that first conference and pictures

600
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,679
from it

601
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,559
and then i went to metacortex's talk

602
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,640
and it went from like this this bug of

603
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
security of pci of things that i thought

604
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
interesting to

605
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
he pulled out a computer

606
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,280
turned up a can of compressed air froze

607
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,480
the ram

608
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
pulled it out and like dumped all the

609
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
memory out of clear text off a computer

610
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
it wasn't even running

611
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,640
and i was just like what in the freak

612
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,440
right like i i legitimately had never

613
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
seen anything any is so amazing

614
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,360
and so i came out of there and i was

615
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,080
like

616
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
wherever this guy is i need to go

617
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
so

618
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
i went 181 laps whatever that pitch was

619
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,559
before but show me that i'm going and it

620
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,240
went from like oh there's not just pci

621
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
but there's like attacks and all this

622
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
other weirdness and so freak so i went i

623
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
went to 801 labs i met troy there um

624
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
i didn't remember him too much from the

625
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
saint con as much but i met him there

626
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,559
he's teaching me how to paint a wall or

627
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,559
something he has a very fancy way to

628
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,600
paint a wall if you need how to paint a

629
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,720
wall

630
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
troy knows how to paint a wall

631
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
i did show him how to like make cables

632
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
and he didn't believe it this is just a

633
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
side i just remembered it um i was doing

634
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
some cat six cables because remember had

635
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,559
a company that we're doing all this

636
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
stupid cabling for two-piece and i was

637
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
like banging him out super fast and he's

638
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
like no way you can do it as good or

639
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
fast as me and i like wrecked him and

640
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,159
then he's like okay that's better uh

641
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,600
anyway after you get your street creds

642
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
make some weird cat6 cables

643
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,480
but

644
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
at 801 labs i met nemus there and i'm

645
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
going to his reverse engineering malware

646
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,360
classes and after sitting through six of

647
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,559
those uh i hate assembly i will never do

648
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
reverse engineering malware i'm glad

649
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,880
people do um i i learned that i don't

650
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
like it um i love nemas he's the best

651
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
but i hate assembly so reverse

652
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,960
engineering malware's out i met neil

653
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
there uh grifter

654

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
to go to black hat

663
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,280
and they're like no you can come on the

664
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,559
knock team and

665
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
go for free and i'm like yeah let's go

666
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
so that's how i joined black hat got in

667
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,159
the black cat not just meeting them

668
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,960
there

669
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,840
and

670
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
lots of people started running dc 801

671
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
and getting presenters and i met a lot

672
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
of people doing that

673
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
so that's how i pivoted there

674
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
and

675
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
then it moved into becoming a defender

676
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,320
so i'm like okay i'm going to get out of

677
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
this director of i.t role and i'm going

678
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
to become a security defender this is a

679
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
game i used to love to play you know

680
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
defender

681
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
so playing defender

682
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
in security um handed lots of tools and

683
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
things that i'd use some parts of some

684
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
not others but just focus instead of

685
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
being like a small part of what you're

686
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,400
doing it's your whole job right you are

687
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
a defender go defend

688
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
and part of that i got handed a qualis

689
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,679
box

690
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,640
okay you got vulnerability management

691
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
cool that doesn't seem so hard

692
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
yeah the whole entire story is about

693
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
quality vulnerability management

694
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,039
it's a mess

695
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,039
like i go in there and look at it and

696
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,880
you have essentially two buckets the

697
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
bucket of the systems that are auto

698
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,280
patching

699
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
they're auto patching and the other

700
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
bucket and that other bucket is the

701
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,039
report that it got generated last week

702
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,640
is the same report that got generated a

703
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
year before except new vulnerabilities

704
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,840
are on it

705
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
right

706
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
and so i'm trying some things there i'm

707
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
you know sending out the auto emails

708
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
asking people to do stuff and it just

709
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
wasn't happening

710
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
right the same report the same thing

711
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
and i became really like frustrated

712
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
about it and there was other things but

713
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,799
like i got super like in a weird funk

714
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
and depressed like maybe i made the

715
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,240
wrong call maybe i shouldn't be in

716
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,679
full-time security maybe go back and

717
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
tear tickets at a movie theater i don't

718
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
know what i'm doing i'm not making any

719
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,280
progress i'm just bashing my head on

720
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
this wall and nothing's happening

721
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
we did some pen testing kind of felt

722
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
like a lot like that when you can't get

723
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
a foothold you're just

724
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,799
slamming your head against the wall the

725
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,320
entire time

726
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
and

727
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
after like few months i was you know

728
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,799
debating just calling that quits

729
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,400
and i just decided you know what i'm

730
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
just gonna hyper focus on vulnerability

731
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
management that's it it's the hardest

732
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,480
thing the part that i hate the most

733
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,840
i'm gonna just focus on that i'm gonna

734
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,200
see what i can do i'm just gonna change

735
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
my mindset about it i get to do this

736
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
instead of i have to do this i'm gonna

737
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,559
plow through on vulnerability management

738
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,520
so i did i created i call the fbi top 10

739
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,559
hit list

740
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,919
where i just said here's the top 10

741
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,000
vulnerabilities in the entire org

742
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
and that department owns one and that

743
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,799
department owns one and that department

744
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,240
owns one so i'm going to send a personal

745
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
email instead of the qualis report i'm

746
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,760
going to copy it out i'm going to paste

747
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
it why it matters what somebody can do

748
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,320
with that information

749
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
let me come and talk to you about it

750
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
afterwards blah blah blah send it over

751
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
some that gained traction some it didn't

752
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
someone just throw out calendar invites

753
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
conference room you

754
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
and i just show up sometimes they showed

755
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,679
up sometimes they didn't but

756
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
interestingly after a while

757
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
it started really gaining traction

758
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,520
people are showing up they're listening

759
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
to what i say they're like yeah that

760
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,559
sounds bad or we're coming up with

761
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,400
mitigations if you can't

762
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
and after a period of time months this

763
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
wasn't like

764
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
the next day

765
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,000
months

766
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
interestingly enough we're all rowing in

767
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,039
the same direction objectively by

768
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,840
reports we have improved security

769
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
posture the thing that i thought was the

770
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,400
hardest most frustrating became very

771
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
rewarding

772
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
building rapport with all these

773
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,400
departments that could care less they

774
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,080
were just like me just availability

775
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
punching holes in firewalls i don't care

776
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
i just need this to work

777
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
right my job is to make stuff work so

778
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,880
start talking to them building those

779
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,279
rapports and improving security and it

780
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,640
was very gratifying when it actually

781
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
happened

782
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
that led into i also find this weird ftp

783
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,880
traffic

784
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
and then that leads into okay what is

785
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
that and it's this camera system and

786
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,480
there's just this camera that's

787
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
legitimately doing the shadiest things

788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,760
ever like full ftp and ssh and ssh ftp

789
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,039
out and it's just like this the most

790
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
amazing proxy for somebody that they've

791
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
just been using for we don't know as far

792
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
as back the logs went

793
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
and so that kind of caught me a little

794
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
bit of bug of like

795
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
going and looking and hunting like oh we

796
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
can just look through this data and find

797
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
interesting stuff

798
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,960
and so i pivoted to another job where

799
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
there's stuff in between but i'm cutting

800
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,159
to the chase for you on this we pivoted

801
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,360
to a job where we went and did a lot of

802
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,440
threat hunting and part of that i was a

803
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
sales engineer team who worked on uh

804
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,440
threat hunting

805
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
and i got to talk with giant giant orgs

806
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
and hunt through giant orgs data and

807
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
that was a lot of fun and we do stories

808
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
on that me and grifter have a ton of

809
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
stuff on those

810
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
and

811
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,640
you could easily tell the org who

812
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,799
was just trying to do a compliance

813
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,760
checkbox for the sake of it

814
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,559
or for h or sorry for insurance or for

815
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,080
compliance or some other reason or the

816
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
ones who actually cared

817
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,480
legitimately there was orgs where

818
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
yeah you put in the ids you racked it

819
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,559
you powered it on

820
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,240
okay how's it working how do you use it

821
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
oh we don't use it traffic actually

822
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,039
doesn't pass to the ids

823
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,720
so wait you bought a really expensive

824
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
ids and you're not passing any traffic

825
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,520
into it that's correct

826
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,520
why would you do that

827
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
oh because our compliance says we have

828
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,080
to have an ids

829
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,880
but it doesn't say it has to be used or

830
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,520
even monitoring traffic

831
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,320
this is this is stuff you find and see

832
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
if you're just trying to check a box you

833
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
can absolutely check a security box and

834
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
miss the whole point

835
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
and i've seen it

836
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,880
you can also do it for the right reasons

837
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,240
and when you talk to an org that was

838
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
doing it for the right reasons it was

839
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
super refreshing here's what we do and

840
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
we're trying to improve this posture and

841
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,480
here's our prioritization list and

842
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,679
here's what we're working on that gives

843
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,480
me like goosebumps i'm like oh like

844
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
i just love talking to you because you

845
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,200
care about security for the right

846
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,799
reasons when you're doing it just to

847
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
like i don't really want to deal with

848
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,440
this i'm just required to um

849
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,520
you might as well just not do it right

850
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,279
but part of that we're still dealing

851
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
with the same things these big orgs with

852
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
big security teams we're still talking

853
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
about

854
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,919
cis 20 or 18 now i guess we're calling

855
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,480
18 now cas 18 framework or whatever

856
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,799
framework you choose not discriminatory

857
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
um and the number one is inventory your

858
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,080
devices

859
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
well big words with big teams still

860
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
don't have this down

861
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,159
the ones who care and are really doing

862
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,679
it for the right reasons

863
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
have it down where it matters

864
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,159
i have my critical servers i know what

865
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
they are and if anything ever gets added

866
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,679
there i get a notification or alert on

867
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,320
it

868
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,600
maybe they don't care about the kiosk in

869
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
the lobby maybe they don't care about

870
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,919
guest wi-fi ceo's laptop yep cfos they

871
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,840
care about the critical assets but we're

872
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,520
still talking about these same things a

873
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
decade later same slide deck inventory

874
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
of devices we're spending time looking

875
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
at that local admin i remember going on

876
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,840
a circuit across utah talking about how

877
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
to remove local admin from your

878
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,039
environment

879
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
still a thing we're still talking about

880
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
this because it's hard security is hard

881
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
it's the part that makes it exciting and

882
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
fun it's also the part that gets you a

883
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,279
little bit depressed like ah

884
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
how did that ransomware spread oh yeah

885
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,360
they all had local admin cool

886
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
yep that makes sense um why does

887
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
somebody in finance need local admin i

888
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,039
don't know it's like the sister of the

889
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
owner and they just needed to have it

890
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,960
right

891
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,320
but we're still talking about these same

892
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
things

893
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
one more thing i wanted to note on a

894
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
story wise i was sitting here running av

895
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
and we had a keynote lost and my

896
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
favorite 2017 i think that's right

897
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
anyway i was just sitting sitting down

898
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,200
here i think it was actually on the

899
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,159
floor like by the camera and uh

900
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,000
he mentioned something like

901
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
just a single slide deck it was like a

902
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,840
single a single slide hey uh

903
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,559
sometimes when i'm doing pen tests

904
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,840
i checked for a cisco smart

905
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,320
vulnerability

906
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
and i remember pulling out my google uh

907
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,919
keep my notes and i wrote cisco

908
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,760
smartphone ability question mark

909
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
okay and then i forgot all about it for

910
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
like months

911
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,000
months later i was looking through my

912
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
notes go smartphone what is that start

913
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,279
researching it oh cisco says it's not a

914
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
vulnerability it's a feature cool all

915
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
right so not a vulnerability um are we

916
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,799
looking at the same thing yep we are

917
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,240
that's it all right well i'm gonna try

918
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
it grab a script

919
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
i run it against a cisco back end

920
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,320
switches and i get a full config i'm

921
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
like dang

922
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,520
maybe i'm in a privileged network though

923
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,080
so i spin up a vulture vps and one of

924
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,320
the shady vps is like 2.50 cents or

925
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
something it's a bit of a vulture vps

926
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,440
and

927
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
i do it again and i dump the config

928
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
again from a privileged network

929
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
completely external in la

930
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,960
the vulture one

931
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,880
and then i was like holy crap that's not

932
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,799
good so i'm like can we check the logs

933
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,679
and see if anybody's done this before

934
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,720
i come back yep besides my ip yep

935
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
somebody has dumped this config before

936
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
and that turned into

937
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,480
a full scale we gotta burn keys we gotta

938
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
burn creds there's automated tools that

939
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
are rolling these keys and creds and

940
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,080
part of that people were like this is

941
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,679
awesome and we're glad we found this but

942
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,600
then there's also like

943
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,520
freaking security

944
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,159
has given us so much work to do

945
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,440
right you've just saddled us with this

946
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
pile of work to do when we already have

947
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
our job and everything to do and now we

948
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
got to go do all these switches and all

949
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,159
these things

950
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,520
let alone some of those switches when

951
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,039
you update them remotely in the middle

952
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,360
of utah fall over

953
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
and that caused all sorts of other grief

954
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,279
and right i wasn't intending to cause

955
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,399
any grief

956
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,320
right that's not the intent

957
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
but the view of that some people were

958
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
very appreciative this is great we're

959
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,840
glad we found this we're glad somebody's

960
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
not in there we should definitely roll

961
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,760
this and others were like no

962
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,039
we'd rather not know

963
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,760
so

964
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
what does this all lead you i told you a

965
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
lot of stories let's see if we can

966
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
stitch them together

967
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
right sometimes what do we need in

968
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
security sometimes we just need buy-in

969
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,039
and spend time materials tooling

970
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,559
whatever that might be to move things

971
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
forward sometimes we need to listen

972
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,679
maybe there's just a keynote

973
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
maybe not me something maybe more wise

974
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,200
like lost who's up here with just a

975
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
little nugget of something that you're

976
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
like maybe you're going to sink on your

977
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,279
first time or your fifth time or

978
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,799
whatever and somebody just mentions

979
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,480
something and you just write it down

980
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
like what was that thing i'm gonna go

981
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
research it and pay a little more

982
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
attention to it sometimes it's go look

983
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,799
go hunt right you can assume you're

984
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,159
already compromised and how would

985
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,679
somebody do that and how would you do

986
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,519
that and go look for it do you even have

987
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,039
visibility to see

988
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,720
if that did happen

989
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,159
right do you even have a log that would

990
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,760
show you if somebody did that in that

991
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039
scenario

992
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,159
where you know the cisco cisco did later

993
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,519
categorize that as a vulnerability they

994
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,679
did change it after that

995
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,360
but if in that scenario

996
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
do you even have a log that said

997
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,039
somebody did log in and try that before

998
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,880
or you just don't know

999
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,360
so go look right sometimes it's just

1000
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
james pope with mental struggles of like

1001
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
i'm in this job nothing changed at that

1002
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,840
job the org didn't change the supervisor

1003
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,360
didn't change money didn't change

1004
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
nothing changed except my mindset

1005
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,640
sometimes it's just your mind

1006
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
sometimes you're just told to stay in

1007
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,720
your lane right get out of my face

1008
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,919
security

1009
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,000
you're the no guys your job's just

1010
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
coming here tell me what not to do i

1011
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,519
just want to do my job right i'm

1012
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,519
punching all through firewalls i'm doing

1013
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,640
ie6 and activex we're doing this

1014
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
and so what changed in some of these

1015
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,559
scenarios one it took a breach

1016
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
hopefully that's not needed

1017
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,679
to get

1018
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,200
hearts and minds moving in the right

1019
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
direction

1020
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,919
but it is a reality

1021
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
and hopefully when org gets breached

1022
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,279
they don't end up with this

1023
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,799
baseline of comfortable again that they

1024
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,880
forget that pain and have to go through

1025
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
it again hopefully it doesn't take a

1026
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
breach

1027
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,240
sometimes it's just your mindset i'm

1028
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,600
just going to call this a james pope one

1029
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,519
this is the cycle i go through this is

1030
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,200
what tied this whole talk together from

1031
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,120
when i first thought about doing it was

1032
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
like i got depressed

1033
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,039
oh i've lived this before i've lived

1034
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,799
these cycles sometimes it's just my

1035
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,880
mindset i have the opportunity to be an

1036
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,240
infosec

1037
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
and to look at cool things and do cool

1038
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,919
things i get to do that i can always go

1039
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,760
back and tear tickets

1040
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
right so i get to do this this is what i

1041
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,600
choose to do sometimes there's real hard

1042
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
work and sometimes it's mind-numbing

1043
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
bashing your head on walls

1044
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,279
sometimes it's just hunting i want to go

1045
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,120
hunt through my traffic i'm the biggest

1046
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,360
advocate of threat hunting it's a it's a

1047
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,519
very sexy name that just means you just

1048
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
look through a lot of data

1049
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
and i talk classes on it lots of classes

1050
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
on it and i do recommend everybody goes

1051
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,880
in threat hunts even if you're not a

1052
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
threat hunter because even if you're

1053
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
brand new to an org it helps you

1054
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,760
understand your org your posture what

1055
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
you have where's my ingress egress

1056
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,799
points where do things happen where's

1057
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,120
the vrf where's how does the firewalls

1058
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,960
block this traffic go hunt through your

1059
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
traffic if you don't have time or your

1060
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
boss will let you do it full time which

1061
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,919
most won't

1062
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,840
carve an hour on a friday i'm gonna go

1063
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,679
hunt one hour on friday and just look

1064
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,039
for it what's the worst case you find

1065
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,080
weird stuff bad hygiene and uh well

1066
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,679
hopefully it's not a full-on breach i

1067
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,880
have plenty of stories of those for

1068
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,159
another day but you find interesting

1069
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,760
things and you come out a better

1070
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
defender you should know your network

1071
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,320
better than an attacker who lands on it

1072
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,440
that should be their biggest

1073
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,120
disadvantage when you first land on a

1074
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,159
box or when i had a pen test and you

1075
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,440
land on a box

1076
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
you spend a lot of time trying to

1077
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,320
understand who i am what privileges i

1078
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
have what are the things i can talk to

1079
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,200
security teams that's our biggest

1080
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
advantage this is this subnet this is

1081
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,080
what it can talk to here's the

1082
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,760
privileges they have

1083
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,080
what would i do with that escalade etc

1084
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,480
validating going and checking for things

1085
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
right going and looking for weird camera

1086
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,359
systems um kind of part of hunting also

1087
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,440
kind of part of the lost story of like

1088
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,639
here's this thing it's a new

1089
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
vulnerability well let's go see if that

1090
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,520
impacts us

1091
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,839
the qualis box doesn't tell us that that

1092
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
exists because it wasn't a vulnerability

1093
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,239
at the time

1094
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,159
but here's red team that are using it

1095
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,719
all day every day right

1096
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,719
and then yes back to organizations if

1097
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,800
you can do nothing else then

1098
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
try to do security for the right reasons

1099
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
even if it's hard even if you're like i

1100
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,560
to know all my assets is daunting pope i

1101
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,760
can't do it all

1102
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
i get it right all i guessed wi-fi

1103
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,480
you're probably never going to get there

1104
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,079
but start with your critical what's the

1105
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,520
most important thing to my organization

1106
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,960
data ip

1107
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,639
whatever that is

1108
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,399
you should know what resides on those

1109
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,159
things maybe it's a subnet maybe it's a

1110
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,839
vlan maybe it's however you're logically

1111
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,440
breaking that out

1112
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
know what exists on those and if that

1113
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,760
ever changes you should be notified when

1114
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
that changes there are scripts to do

1115
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
that there's tools to do that there's

1116
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,760
free things to do that

1117
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,960
right so some of that's hard phase one

1118
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
start with whatever that first security

1119
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,079
control is

1120
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,400
okay so this is a tactic

1121
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,240
ttp tactic techniques and protocol this

1122
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,839
is a tactic that came up with somebody

1123
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,640
else i don't know where i got it from

1124
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,920
but this is something that i do

1125
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,640
constantly i did it this week i did it

1126
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,480
even way back when i was getting uh

1127
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,079
depressed about the you know trying to

1128
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,160
get vulnerability management improved

1129
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
what i do is i even if i'm at night and

1130
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,480
i can't think i'm thinking of something

1131
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
i write it down and then i put them all

1132
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,520
on a piece of paper i'm a little bit old

1133
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,079
so sometimes i uh legal pad it i legal

1134
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
pad out all the things that i have

1135
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
problems with that i'm trying to improve

1136
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
and then what i do is i cross off the

1137
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
ones i cannot control

1138
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,800
and this will vary by you your org

1139
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,040
varies by me it varies by the situation

1140
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,320
i'm dealing with

1141
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
so maybe in this situation i have time

1142
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
maybe some examples i have no time right

1143
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
here's the things i can control i have

1144
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,440
time i have the tooling

1145
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
but in some situations maybe you have

1146
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,480
manager buy-in or you don't sometimes

1147
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,599
your manager's like i don't understand

1148
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,040
what this is maybe you should make a

1149
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,720
flow chart right and you make a

1150
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
flowchart and lucidchart and send it to

1151
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,200
them

1152
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,760
most orgs deal with budget and time

1153
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
in some form of those two sometimes both

1154
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,480
some more get lucky enough to get both

1155
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,839
some only get both when you get breached

1156
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,520
those two are complicated people having

1157
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,560
good people having good tools some tools

1158
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,240
are free some tools are paid there's

1159
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,720
various forms of that communication was

1160
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
literally the one thing that i could

1161
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,160
control in that scenario the

1162
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,760
vulnerability scanner it was just the

1163
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,440
way i was communicating nothing else

1164
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,160
changed but my communication right

1165
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
if you're james pope it's always mindset

1166
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
you're training

1167
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,640
your people's training around you

1168
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
not just that that knowledge one right

1169
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,839
there just showing up the same con and

1170
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,200
somebody being like

1171
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
there's more people here that do pci

1172
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
than just you

1173
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,920
and you can talk to them and gain other

1174
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,359
insights of knowledge of things to try

1175
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,760
or do there's a way to dump passwords

1176
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,839
off of memory with a computer that's off

1177
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,320
no idea right knowledge

1178
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
anyway documentation is either like

1179
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
somebody's let me down in the past or

1180
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
it's me letting myself down in the

1181
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,320
future because i don't document but

1182
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
these are things cross out the things

1183
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
you can't control and don't focus on

1184
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
those focus on the ones you can control

1185
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
and yeah if you're me it's pretty much

1186
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,960
always this one this is the one that i

1187
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
always can control and i always get i

1188
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,960
get in cycles i'm not perfect cycles of

1189
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,119
doing this right cycles of not doing

1190
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,960
that right

1191
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,119
so all right what what does this all

1192
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,400
mean pope you've told us all this

1193
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,520
stories and nonsense what does this mean

1194
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,400
well first presentation was 2011.

1195
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
here we are a decade later

1196
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,839
21.

1197
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,680
what i'm hoping is

1198
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,160
2031

1199
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,839
we're not talking about the same things

1200
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,760
again and that's a daunting task because

1201
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,160
as i mentioned those things are hard

1202
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,320
having an inventory of your assets is

1203
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,040
hard removing local admin developers

1204
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,480
security people hard complicated right

1205
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,079
but what can we do in this scenario well

1206
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,079
we can eat our own dog food

1207
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,839
and we can cross out the things we can't

1208
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,160
control

1209
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,800
well i can't change this whole industry

1210
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
but i can change myself i can come to st

1211
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
con i can get knowledge information i

1212
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,240
can write something down and go research

1213
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,320
it later and try it in my org or take

1214
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,880
whatever training i got and empower my

1215
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
organization to make that better

1216
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
but by making yourself better

1217
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
you typically will make your department

1218
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
better

1219
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,119
you'll take a weird thing and suddenly

1220
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,040
that part will grow

1221
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
in some situations maybe that doesn't

1222
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
right there's it's not always rosy and

1223
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
perfect

1224
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,359
sometimes you have to change orgs that

1225
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
does exist as well but by making

1226
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
yourself better you typically will

1227
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,560
improve your department if nothing more

1228
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
than your own contributions to that

1229
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,079
department

1230
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,599
by making your department or whatever

1231
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,119
your security team or whatever it is

1232
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,400
you're going to make your organization

1233
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
better if nothing more than your yield

1234
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,920
output you will make your organization

1235
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
better and by making your organization

1236
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,720
better we will make our industry better

1237
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,079
it doesn't mean just like that

1238
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,440
vulnerability management it doesn't mean

1239
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
that a month later all the things are

1240
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,800
patched

1241
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
and we've made that objective

1242
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,000
improvement

1243
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,960
but over a period of nine months a year

1244
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,560
it's measurable

1245
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
you can actually look at and say because

1246
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,040
we all started doing this thing maybe we

1247
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,320
don't have to keep talking about the

1248
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
same thing

1249
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,599
i am not snow

1250
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,880
if you didn't know sorry for the bait

1251
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,160
and switch

1252
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,400
we love snow we wish her

1253
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,240
she recovers quickly and we get her back

1254
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,280
and we'd love to have her here again

1255
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,960
next year

1256
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,839
but with that said

1257
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,920
hopefully you got something out of this

1258
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,520
maybe it would inspire you a little bit

1259
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
to just like

1260
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
i learned something saying khan i'm

1261
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,079
gonna go try it at my org

1262
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,599
i'm gonna try something and if you bash

1263
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,040
your head on it

1264
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,640
you might bash your head on it that's

1265
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,119
security it's fun but it's frustrating

1266
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,440
at times depending on your role

1267
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,200
and we i don't know how much

1268
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,680
we probably have like a little bit

1269
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,359
if there are questions we can run a mic

1270
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,280
to you if not we can end a little early

1271
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
too

1272
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,839
or yell out and somebody will run you a

1273
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,400
mic

1274
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
it's not the most questioned talk but

1275
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
maybe there is some there's someone down

1276
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,480
over there i see somebody

1277
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,680
i didn't i didn't hear i'm sorry

1278
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,480
you still have all the fortinet aps 801

1279
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,599
labs

1280
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,319
you can have them

1281
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
uh i'm not here to vendor bash but we

1282
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,960
definitely don't use those anymore

1283
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
ask me afterwards when it's not being

1284
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,720
recorded

1285
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,119
we can chat further about that

1286
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
any other questions

1287
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,240
all right well if if anything else i

1288
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,119
would say

1289
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,800
you want to get to network and know

1290
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,680
people

1291
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,000
volunteered a security conference right

1292
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
i showed up at first saintcon in 2014

1293
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,599
helped running some pieces in 2015

1294
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,280
and thankfully john's doing a much

1295
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,200
better job of av than i did and really

1296
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
cool stuff that look forward to seeing

1297
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,880
when we get lpl up here thank you

1298
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,880
everybody

1299
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,040
you
