1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
uh just a quick introduction my name is

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,840
eric benick i'm

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,399
from weber state university my

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,679
job title is kind of fancy it's director

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
of computing services but it really

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
means just

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,880
jack of all trades you just do

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
everything

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
the

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,080
the idea behind the presentation which i

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,199
called

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,720
system administration with the cyber

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
security was

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,439
a

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,680
kind of a practical application

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,039
with

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,519
free tools and at first i tried to think

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
about

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
what i did with those tools and

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
looked at specific instances but the

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
thing is there in our environment we

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,160
have some

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
really nice and expensive stuff that

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
goes with it some incident management

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
software

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
crowdstrike that type of stuff

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,559
and so i didn't really want to make it

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
so specific to that that it wasn't

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
applicable to everybody else so it's

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
been through multiple revisions the

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
the idea is i tried to make it more

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
universally applicable

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,640
so that

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,119
regardless of what your size is

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,960
big or small

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
i hope you could just get some ideas

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,159
might help you

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
improve things in your area maybe make

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,880
your life a little bit easier

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
there's a ton

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,960
just a free stuff out there

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
that you may or may not need and

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,159
there's probably going to be a couple of

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
things that i

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
show or talk about that you

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,560
already know about

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
and a couple of words just at the

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
beginning here

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,079
make sure you check the terms and

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
conditions of the tools before you start

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
using them i know a big thing we run

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,439
into is uh

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
there's stuff out there that's free for

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
personal use but when you put it on your

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
enterprise system you're stuck paying

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
for it are you supposed to

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,159
get approval to use it in your

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
environment and

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
a big reason behind that is sometimes

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,520
some of the

61
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
administrative tools

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
especially for remote administration can

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
trigger incidents

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
and if nobody's expecting it it can be

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
alarming i've i've seen that several

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
times actually with

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
cis internals and some of the other

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
things because

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
they can be used for

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
privilege escalation and lateral

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
movement and sometimes hackers use them

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,120
but

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
they're really useful for legitimate

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
reasons too

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
and these are all things that i've used

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
before and found to be useful

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,680
i tried not to just

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
google a list of stuff

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,360
bring a bunch of junk and then

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,200
talk about it because that's not really

81
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
what the point is everybody can do that

82
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
um and i just also want to say

83
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
i'm not making a personal endorsement

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,680
of companies that produce these products

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
sometimes there's really good stuff

86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
that's put out there by companies

87
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
as contributions to the community that

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
that's part of what they do

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,040
but

90
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
it doesn't mean that i'm saying go out

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
and buy this product or

92
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,159
you know take your business to this

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
vendor i just think that one specific

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
thing is good

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
so i'm gonna go on a couple of

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
fundamentals this is just because i have

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
to start somewhere and i'm not going to

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
spend time discussing these because

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
they're really basic but

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
it's kind of an assumption when i talk

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
about this stuff that

102
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,720
there's a few things that have been done

103
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
already

104
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,000
i would hope that you have a good set of

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
policies in place so that you actually

106
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
know what you're doing and hold people

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
accountable

108
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,720
you're gonna have support from the

109
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
management

110
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
because really if you don't you're in

111
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
big trouble and

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
you'll never get your

113
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
job done

114
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
make sure you've identified user roles

115
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,319
this is really important for the next

116
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
part which is permissions and privileges

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
because different users need different

118
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
permissions most

119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,959
you know everyday productivity users

120
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
don't need to be admins and

121
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,360
maybe developers do so

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
make sure you know that

123
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
and powershell

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
it's so useful if you're managing

125
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
computers in a windows environment i

126
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,720
know they say it's a cross-platform the

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
cross-platform

128
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,680
applicability is

129
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
limited in in my opinion and experience

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,560
but

131
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,478
for windows 100 that's just kind of a

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,440
need to know thing if you want to

133
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
make your life easier

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
so

135
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
going to the next part this is also

136
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
going to be really brief just

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
some suggestions for next steps after

138
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
you get down the basics there's

139
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
a lot of good security baselines and

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
templates available through microsoft

141
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,160
that's a good place to start

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,400
to figure out what kind of security you

143
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
want to implement

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
um learn about windows wmi which is

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
their management instrumentation so this

146
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,440
is useful in both your scripting and if

147
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
you're a developer

148
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
creating your apps

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
in c sharp it basically gives you all

150
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
the information about objects and

151
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,280
classes and

152
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
everything you could recall from windows

153
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
uh that would be useful in

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
doing stuff um

155
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
you know maybe learn a little bit about

156
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,800
pro and ports and protocols

157
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
know how to collect windows logs and

158
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,639
also read and understand a good portion

159
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
of it

160
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
this one is

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
kind of something

162
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
i prefer but it

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
i just suggest try to standardize

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
with one hardware source or vendor if

165
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
possible i know a lot of times it's not

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
due to budgetary but there are vendor

167
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
tools that are very useful

168
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
that you get to take advantage of by

169
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
primarily going with one

170
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
one manufacturer

171
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
you just get good group policies if

172
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,639
you're

173
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
have a domain set up and

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,400
don't don't feel bad about copying what

175
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,520
others have done

176
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,639
because

177
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
that's a good place to start to find out

178
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
what they've done and apply it a couple

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
of recommendations that maybe you want

180
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
to do right now

181
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
is

182
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,600
disable excel 4.0 macros

183
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
block internet explorer because of

184
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,000
mshtml vulnerability in docs i know that

185
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,520
was talked about a little bit in the

186
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,479
keynote

187
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
those are ones that are

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,319
kind of exploited frequently or

189
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,720
attempted to exploit

190
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
and just think about things you can

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,199
combine

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
tools or procedures to make better

193
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
do what works for you

194
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
so and a good example actually of one

195
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
that i've used a lot is

196
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
when automating things

197
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
especially with reporting and

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
information gathering powershell has a

199
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
built-in option that you can email stuff

200
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
out so we use

201
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
basically an smtp relay server to

202
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
email our reports and then they actually

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
show up automatically in box so that you

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,319
can just go in there and collect them or

205
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,840
run them on a regular basis and have

206
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
them you know historical archive

207
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
so that's a really easy but useful

208
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
combination of things um

209
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,160
so

210
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
i'll start out by the next section it's

211
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
just a little bit about human risk

212
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
management so

213
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,319
from the side that i work in the biggest

214
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
risk are the people

215
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,599
um

216
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,639
i do a little bit of server

217
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,880
administration but it's primarily user

218
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
workstations

219
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
so

220
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,000
when you're thinking about

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,039
how to apply security and and policies

222
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
in that area how to configure machines

223
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
just think about those people you got to

224
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,479
know your users but think about how you

225
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
can

226
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,919
work with their interactions with the

227
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,039
machines to mitigate problems

228
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,880
good thing is user session white lists

229
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,639
if you have a domain

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
maybe not let every authenticated user

231
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,319
log into every computer

232
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
maybe try to create security groups and

233
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
you can automate that by putting people

234
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
in the right ou's based on departments

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,840
or whatever

236
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
so that they get updated automatically

237
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
but that'll limit access to computers to

238
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,879
people

239
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
that might have some kind of a reason to

240
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,560
get into them

241
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,400
microsoft lapse that's a good one for

242
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,879
remote administration if you

243
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,560
have people that are standard users but

244
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,479
maybe need to have the ability to

245
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,720
install something

246
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
you know you can generate that random

247
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
password

248
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
and or connect and help them with that

249
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
hardened rdp connections if you went to

250
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,039
the privileged escalation stuff and saw

251
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,720
the mimikats

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
maybe they showed it how you can dump

253
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,759
the memory processes from

254
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,919
basically open rdp sessions to steal

255
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,840
people's credentials that are stored in

256
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
clear text so

257
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,879
there's some things about that

258
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,080
especially when you're connecting to

259
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
servers or sensitive systems there's an

260
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,559
admin session that

261
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,839
helps protect you disable password

262
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,519
saving least privilege model windows

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
credential guard is another good one

264
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
keep yourself safe so

265
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
next part

266
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
going to talk a little bit about

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
automation

268
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
these are things that i've done

269
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,880
that we found to be helpful is

270
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
so windows task scheduler if you don't

271
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,279
have access to

272
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,240
system center configuration manager

273
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
this is something you know that's built

274
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,959
into windows

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,480
yeah and there's all kinds of hooks that

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,959
can be used to execute scripts or gather

277
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
information

278
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,279
pretty much anything that you could

279
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
think of to create a recurring event

280
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
and

281
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,320
the

282
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
the result is you can

283
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,040
basically create reports email them to a

284
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
box account and collect that stuff

285
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,519
so i'm going to pull up a couple of

286
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,480
examples here

287
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,839
of stuff that we've already done

288
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
so i got one

289
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
so this is going to be a report on a

290
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
specific

291
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
workstation about their largest folders

292
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
so

293
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
there could be

294
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
somebody calling and complaining oh i'm

295
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,839
out of space or you know i'm getting

296
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
this warning that

297
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
i can't save

298
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
you might want to know where where all

299
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
their data is being used so

300
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
this one is talking about

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
uh where it actually just lists every

302
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
folder and what the the size and the

303
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,120
number of files are of all those things

304
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,240
so as we can see here

305
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
it lists all the size percentages of

306
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,240
what the total storage is

307
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
it's useful for trying to figure it out

308
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
if they're making that type of complaint

309
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
can be done remotely

310
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
gathered remotely it's

311
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
a pretty easy tool if

312
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
if you're going to do that that's

313
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
through powershell

314
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
windows stability metrics

315
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
let me pull this up i don't think this

316
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,519
will show properly in

317
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,560
box we'll try

318
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
this one gives you a rating of

319
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,279
application stability and if they have

320
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
instable

321
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
or unstable applications

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
it can give you an indication of

323
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
maybe why it failed

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
so as you can see here on this

325
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
workstation

326
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
it gives us information from the system

327
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
logs

328
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
application

329
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
failed to start

330
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
application error and this can help you

331
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
actually predict problems before they

332
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,399
happen so

333
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,760
if you

334
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
if you have a lot of systems you could

335
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
scan this

336
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
and pull it up when people ask about it

337
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
if you only manage a few systems you can

338
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
actually

339
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,079
create a report that tells you what your

340
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
most

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
you know unreliable apps are

342
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,480
oh actually there's another one i can

343
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
show you the

344
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,040
um

345
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
battery health that's another good one

346
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,839
uh if you manage a lot of computers

347
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
i'll skip some of these just because

348
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
they're more ideas free space and files

349
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
microsoft safety scanner that's actually

350
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
a good plan b if you

351
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
have an incident management that comes

352
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
up and you want to find out more

353
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
about what what's going on maybe you

354
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
don't know if it's a false positive or

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,399
a true positive

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
microsoft has a safety scanner app built

357
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
into windows

358
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
so you can actually generate those

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,839
reports

360
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
pull them up remotely and see what it

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
says and it'll actually give you an

362
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
indication of stuff that's been modified

363
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
in the registry when

364
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
what change was made what it could be a

365
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,360
hint of

366
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,839
it's it's basically just a tool

367
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,639
to give you more information

368
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
see

369
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
so audit logins and audit failed logins

370
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
so this is a pretty useful one

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,519
and i'm gonna see if i can pull up this

372
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,920
report here just to make sure i can show

373
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,479
you here

374
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
so if you have nice tools you could

375
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,150
actually pull this up through

376
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,200
[Music]

377
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,360
you know something else but

378
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,920
if you don't maybe you suspect somebody

379
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
is

380
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
logging into your computer

381
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,760
when

382
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,200
they're supposed to be closed could be

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,079
a different employee or could be

384
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,839
you know staff somewhere else

385
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
these ones i've actually got stored in

386
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,480
different folders here

387
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,519
so this is actually

388
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,399
an add-on powershell module

389
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
that you can get from the powershell

390
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
gallery which

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,959
i think it was made for azure but it

392
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
works just fine on most workstations

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,279
so this one takes information from the

394
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,240
windows logs

395
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
it tells you about what you know the

396
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
name of the computer

397
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,319
what type of log it came from

398
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,279
the provider you know event type

399
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,839
audit failure so these could be

400
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
um some of these are part of the

401
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
security scan so just when i ran this

402
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,040
one

403
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,399
it's got me i probably put in the

404
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,480
password wrong

405
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
security scan this is actually our

406
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,240
vulnerability scanner

407
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
it's not it's not too eventful on here

408
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
because there wasn't anything malicious

409
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,720
going on but you could see right away if

410
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,360
you had somebody that wasn't authorized

411
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,639
to be logging in that was connecting

412
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,360
we'll go on there's all kinds of stuff

413
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
you can do you can whitelist extensions

414
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
and chrome and edge it's really useful

415
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,959
if you

416
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
have a problem with people installing

417
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
coupon clippers or whatever they don't

418
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,079
need

419
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
disk space reports so

420
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
i'm going to move on to the tools

421
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
section which is actually

422
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,839
the bulk of this presentation

423
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
so

424
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
rather than creating a bunch of

425
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
powerpoint slides that kind of static

426
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
images i'm going to go through

427
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
some of these and pull them up

428
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
we'll go through the links actually

429
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
on this first one

430
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
it's a tool called wim witch

431
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,639
and

432
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
i found this useful in maintaining our

433
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,359
images

434
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
you know a lot of machines with updated

435
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,839
drivers

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,199
you might image them and then they fail

437
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,639
right away because maybe they don't have

438
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
the nvme controller or

439
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
they might not have the right network

440
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
adapter

441
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,120
uh this is

442
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,040
a script in powershell that has a gui

443
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,639
while i'm waiting for that to pop up

444
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,120
i'll go to the

445
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
page here

446
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,000
so this is a so this blog or our page is

447
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
a good resource for tools

448
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
which i'll include in the information

449
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
i'm going to make available to everybody

450
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,959
but

451
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
uh it's it's part of the free tools this

452
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
msn point manager suite provides to

453
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,319
people

454
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
and sometimes it takes a second to load

455
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
but

456
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
essentially what it does is it takes

457
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,519
your wim images that you captured maybe

458
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,399
through

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,839
system center or you could have done it

460
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,160
through like windows mtt or if you do

461
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,199
your own

462
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
and allows you to essentially inject the

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,199
updates

464
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,480
drivers

465
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
some customizations

466
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,279
a lot of stuff

467
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
language packs you can add or remove

468
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,320
things

469
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,759
and

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
if you if you image a lot of computers

471
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
and you get tired of sitting around for

472
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
the updates to finish this is really

473
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
useful because you can essentially keep

474
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,640
a

475
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,520
an up-to-date image all the time or

476
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,160
we update ours weekly just adding

477
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
relevant drivers or updates to it

478
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
that way it saves you a little bit of

479
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,520
considerable time i should say if you

480
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
have a lot of computers

481
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
and

482
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
makes life

483
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
it's a little easier

484
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,559
in that regard

485
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,039
and

486
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,000
well if it eventually pulls up

487
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,640
i'll go on

488
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
so that the windwitch tool actually goes

489
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,799
really good with this one it's called

490
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
modern driver management

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,480
and this is a tool provided by the same

492
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
company

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
there's a lot of things you can do so

494
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
this one actually can work together with

495
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
your domain

496
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
and it uses wmi to actually scan

497
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,360
the vendor

498
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
and the model number of all your

499
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,559
machines

500
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,679
then you can actually download the

501
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
driver packages you

502
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
you can automate this

503
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
so that

504
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
at given interval all the driver

505
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
packages for all your supported devices

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
are updated

507
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
you can actually

508
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
also use some of this stuff as part of a

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
task sequence so if you use powershell

510
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
if you have windows pe with powershell

511
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
integrated

512
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
there's some stuff you can do with this

513
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
tua to automate

514
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
injection of drivers while you're

515
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
downloading and imaging things

516
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
and there's a little bit of extra

517
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
configuration involved

518
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
otherwise uh

519
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
i'd pull it up for you but i've used

520
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
this one in my office

521
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,240
um this one's up now so this is a whim

522
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
this is a

523
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
whim which has the gui here

524
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
as you can see you can you can import

525
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,520
your existing images which would be

526
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,879
on your system center server

527
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
you know you can insert scripts to be

528
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
done as part of that

529
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,960
that image installation

530
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
drivers here you can inject entire

531
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,520
directories or

532
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
individual files

533
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,880
autopilot so if you want to get rid of

534
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
some of those prompts when you're

535
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,399
setting up a computer

536
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
configuration manager integration

537
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
a lot of stuff

538
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,559
you know useful for

539
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,399
maintaining your packages or your images

540
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
so

541
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
real quick i'm going to just talk about

542
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
uh

543
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
some of the tools i use that are vendor

544
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,559
specific so

545
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,360
i know lenovo has them hp has them for

546
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,400
dell i use it's called command configure

547
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,880
which is actually able to modify bio

548
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
settings

549
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
so

550
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
you get a bunch of computers you want to

551
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,679
make sure

552
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,120
tpm is enabled on all of them

553
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,559
wake on lan

554
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,760
uh

555
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,200
you know vpro or what whatever you want

556
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,280
you can actually configure this to

557
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
automatically apply those bios settings

558
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
and it can be scripted inserted as your

559
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
task sequence we also have group

560
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
policies so if we make a change to

561
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
whatever our configuration is

562
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,760
it applies automatically to all those

563
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,000
machines that we manage

564
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
dell command update is actually another

565
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,240
great tool that they provide

566
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,520
so it automates the updating of bios and

567
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
system drivers and if anybody's ever had

568
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
to manually go and update bios on

569
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,559
you know 50 machines you know

570
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
what a big time saver it is when you can

571
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
automate that and the a little bit of

572
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
warning for

573
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
automating bios updates they can

574
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,520
occasionally trigger bitlocker so if

575
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,799
you're running full disk encryption with

576
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,640
bitlocker make sure

577
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
you're also storing all your keys

578
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
somewhere either

579
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
in active directory or

580
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
you could be downloading them

581
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,159
store them somewhere because

582
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,080
occasionally you'll hit that and

583
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,320
you don't want to be stuck without a

584
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,799
unlock key

585
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,679
so we're going to go on next to

586
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,520
what would be considered information

587
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
gathering

588
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,360
so these ones here are tools that can be

589
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
used inside of other scripts

590
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
powershell typically

591
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,559
and they provide

592
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
information that uh that i find useful

593
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,640
in management there's

594
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,039
wiz tree which is actually a very fast

595
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
disk space analyzer can create a report

596
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
about

597
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,039
how many files you have where

598
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,559
similar to what i showed you before but

599
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,640
a lot more detailed with

600
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
uh graphical output

601
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
i think it makes like a block

602
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,799
type diagram where there's colored

603
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
squares that tell you each type of file

604
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,640
and how much space they're taking up in

605
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
relative to the entire disk

606
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
winderstat that's similar

607
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,720
there's also chainsaw log analysis this

608
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
is one that i actually just found out

609
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
about recently

610
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
and only used it a couple of times but

611
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,120
it is

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
an open source tool that can be used for

613
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
analyzing a large number of logs so

614
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,039
you're

615
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
gathering logs from 50 different

616
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
machines maybe you're looking for

617
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,559
specific events

618
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,799
or trends

619
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,679
um

620
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
and i read a lot of blog posts this is

621
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
uh one from bleeping computer this is

622
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
actually one that i

623
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,880
found out about so

624
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
log management seems to be one of the

625
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
things that there's not a lot of good

626
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,280
open source tools out there for

627
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
there's a few but

628
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
they're so

629
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
hard to come by or specific that

630
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
anything you can get your hands on is

631
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,559
useful so

632
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
this is a good tool if you if you're

633
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
doing log analysis

634
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
i recommend checking it out there's

635
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,360
a list here of what you can do

636
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
search through event logs for specific

637
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
event ids keywords or regex patterns

638
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
extract and parse window defender you

639
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
know basically antivirus alerts

640
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,320
detect users being created or added to

641
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
user groups

642
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
you know key events

643
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
attempts to brute force accounts rdp

644
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
logins etc so

645
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
the the idea with this is if there's

646
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,200
something going on in the big picture

647
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
maybe

648
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
a bunch of your computers are being

649
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,799
brute forced

650
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
you might not see it on the outside but

651
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
if you're doing an analysis you could

652
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
pick it up by saying there's

653
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
you know 10 000 log you know failed

654
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
login attempts across 50 different

655
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
machines

656
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
and

657
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
it's a good little tool for log analysis

658
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,679
so you don't have to actually go through

659
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
and look at all of those

660
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
things

661
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,200
uh win merge so if you ever had two

662
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
things you need to look at side by side

663
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
could be maybe you're looking at a

664
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,960
driver package to determine what's been

665
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
changed or what models are supported or

666
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,120
have been added

667
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
could be

668
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
text file could be anything a program

669
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,400
could be something that's detected by

670
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,880
your incident management response

671
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,480
if you have a known good version of that

672
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
file you want to see what it looks like

673
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
next to one that's in question

674
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
and this was useful recently we had

675
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
an event pull up that was

676
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,159
i think it was

677
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,919
intel amt

678
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,480
so there was a driver that was detected

679
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
as

680
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
having privileged escalation

681
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
in crowdstrike

682
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
but it was it was a pretty it seemed

683
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
like a pretty benign

684
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
daily thing

685
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,159
so

686
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
essentially pull up the

687
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,919
known good version look at it side by

688
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,600
side with the one that was being

689
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,720
detected as being malicious and you can

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,000
see right away the only thing that

691
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,080
really had changed is some

692
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,440
of the information formatting there

693
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
wasn't a whole lot so it was probably

694
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
a false positive generated by

695
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,840
an accidental report that had

696
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,400
application hash to their ai

697
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,799
which happens sometimes so

698
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
it's it's a it's a good thing though

699
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,840
when you

700
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
when you don't know about what the

701
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
situation is to try to verify it some

702
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,960
way

703
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,279
and that's one use there's

704
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,799
an infinite number of ways you can use

705
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,080
win merge

706
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,559
um hxd hex editor that's probably one a

707
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,720
lot of people have heard about

708
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,799
it's just a good freeware hex editor it

709
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,720
also allows you to do a quick and dirty

710
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,760
dump of memory processes which i like

711
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
so if you

712
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
maybe want to see

713
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
if you have insecure rdp sessions you

714
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,279
can go ahead and pull us up and try to

715
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,200
dump your memory processes

716
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,400
search them for

717
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,799
clear text examples of your usernames

718
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,880
and passwords and

719
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
this is also one that may trigger an

720
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
incident management so

721
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
if you are

722
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
memory dumping processes

723
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,960
that can get detected by the ai as

724
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
an attempt to steal credentials so

725
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
that's when you want to just kind of

726
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
think about

727
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,159
application management

728
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,360
these are things that

729
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,440
could help you create or distribute

730
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
packages

731
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
system center configuration manager has

732
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
its own you know built-in thing for

733
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,880
application distribution but you might

734
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
not have access to that

735
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,520
so

736
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,400
chocolaty is great open source tool i

737
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,720
use it all the time and they have public

738
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
repositories for just about everything

739
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
you could think of

740
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,919
and

741
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,080
the most common apps for sure

742
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
if you install

743
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,880
the chocolatey module into chrome or not

744
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,039
into powershell then you can actually

745
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,320
remotely install and update apps

746
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
uh to users you know if they're on your

747
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
domain if they're outside your domain

748
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
uh make it a scheduled task to run that

749
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
command you could do

750
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
choco update chrome i think is what it

751
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,559
would be and that would just update

752
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
chrome to the latest version or

753
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,039
whatever application that you have that

754
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,039
installed with chocolaty

755
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,919
so

756
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,360
it does have the option to actually

757
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
create your own repositories there's

758
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,240
free

759
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
repository software one of them's nexus

760
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
nougat

761
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,880
you can use visual studio code to create

762
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,640
your packages

763
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,360
uh requires a little bit of work but

764
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
for free it's it's a great alternative

765
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,840
a lot easier than going and taking you a

766
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
speed drive and plugging it in

767
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,799
everywhere

768
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,760
um msix application packager so this is

769
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,679
a fairly new one

770
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
and we've used it a few times

771
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
for

772
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,039
applications that are really tricky with

773
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,480
trying to think of a good example we

774
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,960
have so we have one app that stores

775
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,559
registration key and the user

776
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,960
information in the in the user profile

777
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,640
but we have multiple users that log into

778
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,559
that machine which means every time a

779
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,039
new person logs in that application has

780
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,279
to be reactivated

781
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,080
and but it deactivates the last time

782
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
so you just have this mess of constantly

783
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
having to enter the key and reactivate

784
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
it

785
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,840
with the msi packager you can basically

786
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,559
re-wrap the installer to

787
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,080
do stuff let's say

788
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,919
we want to run it as the same user every

789
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,399
time so regardless of who's logged in

790
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,520
you can define a specific user

791
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
and when

792
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
to the users it's pretty much

793
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,919
transparent they just run and install it

794
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,360
as normal but

795
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
you you include the registration key

796
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
installs runs as that same user every

797
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,080
time

798
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
and they're

799
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,520
applications that are packaged with msix

800
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,000
are more similar to containers than

801
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
there are to traditional windows

802
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,960
installs so

803
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,880
if you're familiar with how that works

804
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,120
it's a much cleaner and safer way of

805
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,279
installing things

806
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
since when that application package is

807
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,799
deployed everything registry keys

808
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
it's essentially packaged as a separate

809
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,240
layer almost

810
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,799
you know a container on top of the os

811
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,120
so adding and moving apps is really easy

812
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
you know doing arguments

813
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,279
you could totally redesign how an

814
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,880
application is installed or how it

815
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,640
appears to the user

816
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
during the install process or

817
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,760
take something that wouldn't be a

818
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
transparent install and install it

819
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,000
and

820
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,480
it has a ton of features i have haven't

821
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,039
been able to explore it all yet but

822
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,919
um

823
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
it's very useful

824
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,959
so master packager this is one

825
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,799
i think i'll pull up here and show you

826
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,760
so this is another

827
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,480
free application packager similar to

828
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,039
msi packager msix

829
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,520
but provided by a third party

830
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,918
and

831
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,159
nice thing about this is it's another

832
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
one of those tools that

833
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,720
can be very useful but it's

834
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
difficult to come by there's a lot of

835
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
options that cost money to go out there

836
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,799
and

837
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,158
package applications but

838
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,440
not a lot that are free

839
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,159
let's see if i can pull something out

840
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,960
here real quick

841
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,320
so you can take existing msi installers

842
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,159
make this bigger pull them up in the in

843
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,600
the packager

844
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,399
and modify the parameters

845
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,039
of that msi installation

846
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,279
or you can just see what it has inside

847
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,960
of it sometimes

848
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
maybe you want to know what registry

849
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
registry keys this application is going

850
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,039
to add to your machine

851
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
that's another good use of this you can

852
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,000
actually open existing app packages

853
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,360
you know browse what those are going to

854
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,799
be

855
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,240
maybe you have a questionable

856
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,840
application that you got from somewhere

857
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
but you just

858
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
want to make sure it's safe

859
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,399
change the icons

860
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,559
as you would expect in

861
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,000
a package manager you can just pretty

862
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
much modify it any way you want

863
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,200
you can change the install and uninstall

864
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
parameters where location is

865
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,679
all that good stuff if you want to

866
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,640
install

867
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
user data or program files

868
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,320
a lot of useful things can be done with

869
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,120
an application packager

870
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,640
um psf deploy toolkit this is one

871
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,399
i've

872
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,880
i think i've used it once or twice

873
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,240
but when i did use it it was actually

874
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
pretty useful

875
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
so this is essentially

876
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,760
a toolkit designed for pushing out

877
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,120
applications via powershell

878
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,000
so this can be useful um just about any

879
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,840
environment you

880
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,159
you can use that app packager when i

881
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,679
just showed you to

882
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
create a new application package or

883
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
re-wrap an existing one

884
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,200
and then you can just do a mass

885
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
deployment with these powershell app

886
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,639
deployment toolkit

887
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
i won't go through all of the

888
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,279
information on that it's it's all

889
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,960
available on the website here but it

890
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
tells you

891
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,919
you know

892
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,720
you can integrate it with secm

893
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,440
um or standalone

894
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,440
all right so i'm going to go on to a

895
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
couple of things now that i think are

896
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
just primarily making life a little bit

897
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,799
easier

898
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,840
so

899
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,039
client center for configuration manager

900
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,720
now this is an open source project on

901
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,399
github that

902
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,080
works with

903
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
microsoft configuration manager but it

904
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
kind of consolidates

905
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,039
a lot of little things and gives you an

906
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,720
interesting interface

907
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,559
it's actually available in the microsoft

908
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,480
store too so it's

909
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
something that can be installed quite

910
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,240
easily

911
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,560
there it is

912
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,040
so you can essentially connect

913
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,199
to a computer on the network or in the

914
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,320
domain

915
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
i p address machine name

916
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,639
oh i gotta run it as an administrator

917
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,280
that's why it's not working

918
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,000
oh come on

919
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,240
maybe if my right click would work

920
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,760
okay

921
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,160
um

922
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,520
so some of the things that i think are

923
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,720
really useful about this is uh it's got

924
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,880
some good monitoring tools

925
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,440
you can monitor

926
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,400
processes in real time

927
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,880
you can see what services are running

928
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,520
it's got the event monitor which

929
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,800
is

930
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,320
information that will end up in your

931
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
system logs

932
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,520
but this tells me all processes that are

933
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,400
running adobe cef helper

934
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
you can also actually remotely terminate

935
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,119
processes so

936
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,480
if i want to get rid of this somebody's

937
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
complaining about something taking up a

938
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,000
lot of resources making the computer

939
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
slow

940
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,640
right click it

941
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,240
kill process

942
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,520
it's going to terminate that on that

943
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,280
machine

944
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
just as if you had done it from there

945
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,200
task manager

946
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
it's got some inventory information so

947
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
you can actually

948
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,279
see what software has been installed

949
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,599
gives you a list of stuff

950
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,920
some some information about the hardware

951
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
can tell you kind of hardware installed

952
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,119
you know make and model serial numbers

953
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,240
stuff of that nature power settings

954
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,200
a lot of neat little things that are

955
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
kind of combined into this user

956
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,279
interface

957
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,520
software distribution this is

958
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,599
kind of a quick and dirty way of pushing

959
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,680
out

960
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,119
applications via powershell and the the

961
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,560
nice thing about this tool is if you

962
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
have

963
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
uh stuff that you need to install needs

964
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
administrative credentials this will

965
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,920
actually

966
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,000
encrypt the credentials

967
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,240
for the user you're logged in as or the

968
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,720
user that you run it as that way if

969
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
you're executing something remotely

970
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,440
installing software the credentials

971
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,400
aren't

972
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,599
available

973
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,680
in clear text or in a file or something

974
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
to be stolen they're actually

975
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,960
encrypted and

976
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,800
and used to authenticate on the remote

977
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,200
machine if you've so as long as you have

978
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,520
admin privileges on that machine

979
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,200
everything should work as expected

980
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
they have you can actually open a remote

981
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
powershell terminal

982
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
um

983
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,359
there's some stuff here for uh reporting

984
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
let's see if there's anything

985
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
interesting

986
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
emt status check

987
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,440
yeah

988
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,040
so

989
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
it's a nifty little tool that really

990
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,079
that you can use

991
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,040
we use it occasionally just

992
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,839
to troubleshoot things

993
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,320
um so sysinternals this

994
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,040
this one's been around a long time and i

995
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
think

996
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
a lot of people are going to know about

997
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
this

998
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,760
and have used it before

999
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,480
but this is a really power powerful

1000
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
extension

1001
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,520
to microsoft powershell

1002
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,280
really good for

1003
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
doing networking diagnostic

1004
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,839
troubleshooting remote administration

1005
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,560
it was just recently updated to actually

1006
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
be in the microsoft store so you can

1007
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,880
have it updated automatically

1008
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,400
a word of warning though this is

1009
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,079
something that will almost certainly be

1010
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,839
detected by

1011
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,480
your incident management software simply

1012
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,880
because it has so many functions that

1013
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,040
are

1014
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
done with administrative privileges or

1015
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,000
stuff that would normally not be done

1016
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,640
remotely

1017
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
there's a whole list of things here for

1018
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,119
file and disk utilities we use these as

1019
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,280
part of our scripts for

1020
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,280
doing all kinds of things you can um

1021
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,640
i think there's like a speed test

1022
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,800
in here so someone's complaining about

1023
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,640
slow internet we

1024
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
create a actually outputs what all of

1025
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
their

1026
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
network connections are

1027
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,240
their configurations does a speed test

1028
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
with against a designated server you

1029
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,440
know it tells you what their transfer

1030
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,839
rates are creates a report emails it to

1031
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,680
box we open it up and then

1032
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,079
we kind of have an idea of where to

1033
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,599
start when we're troubleshooting

1034
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,280
complaints of a

1035
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,079
slow access

1036
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,680
security utility so

1037
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,560
auto log on

1038
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,200
that's

1039
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,520
it's basically a better way of doing the

1040
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
if you have an instance where you have a

1041
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
machine that you need to boot straight

1042
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,839
into

1043
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,839
an application like a kiosk maybe

1044
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,280
a slightly improved way of doing that

1045
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
gives the information about logged in

1046
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,079
sessions rootkit revealer

1047
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,119
you can

1048
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,200
scan you can set up scan remotely via

1049
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
script looking for

1050
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,359
hints of a root kit

1051
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,880
let's see it's a lot of information

1052
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,760
about hardware miscellaneous

1053
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,359
super useful this is this probably the

1054
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,800
most useful

1055
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,250
powershell suite

1056
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,359
[Music]

1057
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,280
that we use just because it has so many

1058
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,040
useful tools inside of it

1059
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,200
so i've got a couple of little things

1060
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,560
here

1061
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
i mean macs they do exist and we got

1062
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,079
some of them

1063
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
in our environment so i did include a

1064
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,480
couple of things we've used before to

1065
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
help with that

1066
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,079
there's a really good little profile

1067
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,040
creator anybody that's ever tried

1068
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,800
making an mdm or using apple's

1069
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,040
uh managing thing what is it i can't

1070
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,960
remember

1071
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
yeah anyway it stinks when you're when

1072
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,319
you're managing profiles for ipads or

1073
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
laptops and stuff like that

1074
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
so there is a pretty good get project

1075
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,079
available

1076
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,319
and it's just called profile creator

1077
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,960
and it

1078
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,760
the application itself

1079
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,599
isn't actively maintained but the

1080
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,160
modules that are used in the application

1081
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,800
are so

1082
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
you can use the source code and

1083
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,440
recompile for new versions of os x

1084
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,400
big sur for example has been updated by

1085
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,160
community users rather than the original

1086
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,280
author

1087
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,800
but for

1088
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,359
still a majority of the macs out there

1089
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,880
you can use this to actually create

1090
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,560
profiles that will still work the

1091
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,160
the one catch right now is if you use

1092
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,880
the one that's on this page

1093
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,560
you may have to

1094
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,319
have a mac with an older version of the

1095
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,240
os to make the profile creator work but

1096
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
the profiles that you

1097
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,040
generate will work perfectly fine on

1098
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
the newer versions of the os

1099
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,480
since the settings are all the same

1100
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,319
and i mean there's a ton you can do

1101
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,400
hundreds of options

1102
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,839
if you've ever created profiles you know

1103
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,720
you can customize everything

1104
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,880
brigadier so this is an interesting tool

1105
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,000
anybody that has an intel mac that still

1106
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
has the ability to do boot camp

1107
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
some of that setup and install can be

1108
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,079
automated with this tool

1109
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,119
uh basically scans the model number

1110
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,960
from the bios automatically drives

1111
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,520
downloads of driver packages from apple

1112
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,560
server

1113
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
and then after that it's up to you but

1114
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,839
if you let's say you want to get rid of

1115
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,480
the mac os or add another partition with

1116
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,839
windows

1117
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,000
you can create task sequences in system

1118
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,040
center that

1119
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,920
create the image you use the brigadier

1120
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,319
command to download the app the driver

1121
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,839
packages

1122
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,640
and essentially continue installation

1123
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,480
put it all together boot it up have a

1124
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
working version of windows

1125
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,440
and

1126
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,200
saves you the time of messing around

1127
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,919
with boot camp

1128
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,400
it doesn't work with the m1 max

1129
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
unfortunately that's

1130
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,000
just a different world

1131
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,880
a couple of words these are just shout

1132
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,319
outs i'm not going to talk about them

1133
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,720
really because the oldies but goldies

1134
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,920
they're just

1135
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
good tools in general other people i'm

1136
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
sure we'll talk about them way more

1137
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
notepad plus plus

1138
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,280
it's just a good

1139
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,599
text editor in general for

1140
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,599
opening scripts really quick and looking

1141
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,359
at stuff

1142
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,119
wireshark

1143
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,359
doesn't really need much introduction

1144
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,440
i've used it several times when

1145
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
troubleshooting issues with file shares

1146
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,560
or

1147
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,760
stuff like that um trying to track down

1148
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,800
why this

1149
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,440
app worked doesn't work when it should

1150
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
it could be one single protocol isn't

1151
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,960
working

1152
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
vmware horizon that was a good one that

1153
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,720
setting that up has all kinds of things

1154
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,560
you need to

1155
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
configure on the firewall

1156
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,920
putty ssh ssh still exists

1157
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,680
all over the place you being able to

1158
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,480
access it from windows is is great

1159
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
app locker it's probably a bit of an

1160
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,200
under appreciated tool

1161
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,160
if you

1162
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
run an environment where you can't make

1163
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,520
everybody a standard user but you can

1164
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,359
do

1165
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,040
application limitations on what they

1166
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,000
install this is the way to do it

1167
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,760
basically provided by windows you can

1168
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,119
define

1169
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,880
applications limit them either by

1170
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,640
version or

1171
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,240
you know not limit them by version you

1172
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,280
can just

1173
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
limit them by application name so

1174
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,119
you might want them to be able to stall

1175
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,880
every version of zoom

1176
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,319
or every version newer than 5.0 set that

1177
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,599
all up in

1178
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,520
app locker and even though the users are

1179
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,119
administrative users

1180
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,880
if they try to do stuff outside of

1181
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,839
what's defined they just can't so

1182
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,000
i got some honorable mentions here oh so

1183
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
these are tools that are pretty specific

1184
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,079
to

1185
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,440
maybe

1186
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,040
if you have health care records in your

1187
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
area

1188
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,720
there's the health and human services

1189
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,040
provides some useful little tools

1190
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,920
there's

1191
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,880
security risk assessment tool

1192
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,200
sra tool this is

1193
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,960
mostly a question and answer thing the

1194
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,480
trick with this is you have to be honest

1195
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,839
so we'll go through and ask you a whole

1196
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,440
bunch of branching questions that helps

1197
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,520
you evaluate where you're at

1198
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
from a compliance standpoint and what

1199
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,119
you can do to improve

1200
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,200
if you don't know where to start this is

1201
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,640
this a perfect place to start because

1202
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,000
it's essentially

1203
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,680
not very technical you just install the

1204
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,079
app you run it generates reports

1205
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:08,960
and

1206
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,240
gives you an idea of what to do next

1207
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,400
oh this is

1208
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,920
another one provided by health and human

1209
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,400
services security content automation

1210
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,680
protocol

1211
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,919
so

1212
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,440
it's another tool just just to help you

1213
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,200
check if you're you know where you're at

1214
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
with compliance um

1215
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
has a wide range of compatibility

1216
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,800
install guide this one's a little bit

1217
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,839
more technical to set up

1218
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,440
so good information sources the

1219
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,760
i mean the backbone to staying on top of

1220
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,680
things is just develop a list of good

1221
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,480
information sources maybe create a

1222
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,560
mailing list

1223
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,079
whatever works for you

1224
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,040
in fact i use essentially

1225
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,800
you know like a feed burner i think is

1226
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,640
what it is

1227
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,319
i've used that before

1228
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,640
but essentially create your own feed of

1229
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,160
these sites that you find interesting

1230
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,240
that will have news for you that it

1231
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
tells you what's going on in the world

1232
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,560
of security could be

1233
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,119
what zero day exploits are what the new

1234
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,200
new tools are

1235
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,160
what people are doing

1236
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,960
good ideas

1237
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,640
this one here i find especially

1238
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,200
intriguing

1239
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,760
system deploy so

1240
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,280
this guy is a system administrator that

1241
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
he just provides a ton of useful ideas

1242
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,680
he

1243
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,000
has done all kinds of cool stuff he's

1244
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,280
replaced all the default visual basic

1245
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,200
mdt scripts with powershell stuff he

1246
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,680
provides in-tune reporting

1247
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,240
tells you how to make dot-net menus for

1248
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,160
powershell-based applications so you can

1249
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,559
have a more traditional gui

1250
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,559
maybe you want to make a one-click

1251
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,680
button

1252
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,200
application that

1253
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,640
sets up a

1254
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,839
you know a bunch of applications and

1255
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,040
windows and you can do that

1256
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,839
he's got all kinds of stuff highly

1257
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,200
recommended just to see what he's got

1258
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,280
because it's it's just really neat he's

1259
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,839
really talented

1260
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,079
a powershell gallery that's

1261
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,079
of course microsoft

1262
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,440
sponsored one

1263
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,119
tons of tools

1264
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,599
modules to extend powershell to do

1265
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,119
pretty much anything you want one of

1266
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,839
them

1267
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,280
that i was looking at recently was

1268
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,319
actually

1269
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,520
um

1270
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,000
duo i don't see it on here but

1271
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,599
maybe it's in the git

1272
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,839
but

1273
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,520
just about anything you could want to do

1274
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
is is available through the powershell

1275
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,280
gallery you basically take what they

1276
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,880
give you

1277
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,119
customize it to do what you want it's

1278
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,079
the sky's the limit

1279
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,520
a couple other good places oh this is

1280
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,920
another new one i found the cyber drain

1281
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
it's just recently this is

1282
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,760
something i found through the microsoft

1283
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,319
mvp which is most valuable professionals

1284
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,079
page

1285
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,960
he does a lot of cloud stuff managing

1286
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,599
microsoft 365.

1287
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,040
he gives you a lot of just free

1288
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,480
automations

1289
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,559
and this guy's also a major contributor

1290
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,240
to a lot of the

1291
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,680
large

1292
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,200
system management and application

1293
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,520
packages so whatever he gives away for

1294
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
free is actually probably worth

1295
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,839
thousands of dollars and you'd pay

1296
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,200
thousands of dollars if you bought it

1297
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,480
through one of his

1298
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,280
collaborators

1299
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,520
a couple of things at the bottom here

1300
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,720
these are

1301
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,240
these are free tools

1302
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,559
that are marked with an asterisk because

1303
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,240
um

1304
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,040
they

1305
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,960
kind of have a

1306
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,480
they might make try to make you sign up

1307
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,240
for their email list

1308
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,520
i actually still think they're really

1309
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,559
good

1310
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,599
this one here wmix

1311
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,200
is very useful so if you're just getting

1312
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,319
into

1313
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,480
wmi and what you can do

1314
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,760
this is actually a really nice tool

1315
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
because it essentially lets you browse

1316
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,559
everything so you can define locally

1317
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,359
remotely you can browse what the wm mi

1318
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,680
objects are get an idea

1319
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,599
of what you want to put in the script or

1320
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,359
export what you find

1321
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,440
they do make you

1322
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,119
put your name and information in here

1323
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,640
that's why

1324
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,599
i marked it with an asterisk but

1325
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,520
i use a burner account for that i have a

1326
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,599
spam account that uh i'm sure a lot of

1327
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,200
people do you just sign up and then

1328
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,359
download the tool they don't

1329
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,680
they don't make you verify anything

1330
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,040
after you put your information in

1331
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,359
recast right click tools

1332
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,559
another one you have to

1333
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,920
sign up before they remove the wall but

1334
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,559
uh this is a free tool essentially adds

1335
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,040
more actions to your right-click menus

1336
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,880
so you can customize these on your own

1337
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,839
you can

1338
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,680
you can go to registry and customize

1339
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,200
what shows up when you right-click but

1340
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,720
this adds a lot of other useful

1341
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,240
functions that may extend the

1342
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,160
functionality of tools like

1343
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,400
system center

1344
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,000
they've packaged all together to make it

1345
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,359
a little bit of a

1346
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,359
slicker experience or quicker to get to

1347
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,559
things so you don't have to click

1348
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,839
through a bunch of extra links

1349
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,760
windows tweaker tool

1350
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:42,800
it's

1351
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,640
there's something fixing permissions

1352
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,119
fixing windows updater

1353
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,319
sometimes things happen that you just

1354
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,160
can't figure out this is

1355
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,640
something i've used before their

1356
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,359
their page is just packed with ads

1357
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,480
so

1358
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,040
the tool itself is free once you get it

1359
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,119
there's no pop-ups or advertisements or

1360
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,800
anything

1361
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,599
does have a banner but the

1362
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,359
making sure you find out which download

1363
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,119
link to click on that's a tricky part so

1364
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,520
that's why i put it with an asterisk and

1365
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,759
it's

1366
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,960
it's a good tool though that's

1367
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,960
i put the wrong link though but

1368
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,440
let's see if there's anything else i i

1369
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
mean that about summarizes it i

1370
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,720
have a few minutes left

1371
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,119
i apologize for going so fast i signed

1372
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,839
up for the one hour presentation

1373
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,000
imagining it was gonna seem like it took

1374
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,680
forever and then when i realized the

1375
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,960
content it

1376
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,720
that i had and how much there is out

1377
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,400
there

1378
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,599
yeah it seemed like i should have signed

1379
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,160
up for two or three hours but the i want

1380
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,820
to ask if anybody has any questions or

1381
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,480
[Music]

1382
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,520
wants to see anything know anything

1383
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,720
i'm going to actually

1384
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,440
provide just a list with all the stuff

1385
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,359
the links to all the sites

1386
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,319
um

1387
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,920
and talk to

1388
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,119
chris afterwards and they're going to

1389
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,880
put it up somewhere on the saintcon site

1390
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,640
so that anybody that's interested in

1391
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,559
these can go back and and look at them

1392
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,040
in more detail and

1393
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,480
yeah it's a lot of useful things in here

1394
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,280
but any any questions

1395
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,200
oh endpoint management

1396
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,760
um

1397
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,920
let's see

1398
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,079
the

1399
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,640
i'm trying to think without i so i've

1400
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,720
got one right now i use called

1401
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,839
governland

1402
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,079
which i really like the um try not to

1403
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,280
give an endorsement because when i

1404
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,680
signed up for it i said you know not

1405
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,800
gonna

1406
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,480
promote anything but

1407
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,000
the

1408
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,160
i mean system center configuration

1409
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,559
manager

1410
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,240
has some endpoint management stuff if

1411
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,880
you're using windows defender

1412
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,440
i mean we we have crowdstrike

1413
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,720
and rapid7 and we have so many things

1414
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,960
that just work together

1415
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,599
um oh my gosh it's hard to pick out one

1416
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,280
in particular because we use all of the

1417
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,480
stuff

1418
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,480
i mean but but governland i think is one

1419
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,760
that i

1420
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,359
have used a lot and liked a lot

1421
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,960
and um i mean there's there's lots out

1422
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,200
there

1423
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,480
just depends on what your needs are if

1424
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,240
you need compliance if you need fips

1425
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,520
compliance

1426
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,319
there's not a whole lot so

1427
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,280
if you need

1428
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,720
certain levels of compliance that's one

1429
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,920
thing that really you need to look at

1430
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,880
when you're doing your endpoint

1431
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,680
management like if it supports

1432
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,799
like mf mfa authentication

1433
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,000
that's really important because if

1434
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,040
you're doing any type of remote

1435
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,119
administration in an environment that

1436
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,319
requires

1437
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,640
high level of security

1438
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,040
um some example i used was the fips so

1439
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,079
if you're working in the federal

1440
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,760
government anywhere that requires

1441
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,200
clearance

1442
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,119
you have to have you know their cards

1443
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,079
and

1444
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,839
the any endpoint management solution you

1445
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,520
have would be need to be

1446
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,920
fixed fips compliant it's hard to say

1447
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,680
what i like because it's

1448
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,919
more applicable to what you need but

1449
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,359
yeah the

1450
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,040
there's a lot of options

1451
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,319
is it is there anything else

1452
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,839
all right well thank you guys i think

1453
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,520
this is the last presentation of the day

1454
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,799
so

1455
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,400
if you want to come up and talk to me

1456
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,760
about anything
