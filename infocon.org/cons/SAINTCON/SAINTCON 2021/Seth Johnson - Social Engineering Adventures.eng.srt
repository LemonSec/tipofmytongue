1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
uh good afternoon everyone my name is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
seth i commonly go by sj i'm on the utah

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
saint board of directors and on the st

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,720
con committee

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
i hope you are enjoying the conference

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,040
and i hope you're getting a lot of great

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,480
information and education as part of

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,759
your experience here and i hope that

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
what we're about to talk about for

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,720
social engineering will give you some of

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,279
that and also be a little bit of fun

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,039
without further ado since we're really

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,880
short on time let's talk about what is

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,720
social engineering

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,240
first of all a lot of people when they

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
think about social engineering they

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
think of social engineering as some kind

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,479
of

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,440
mind jujitsu or the kind of thing in the

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
movie black widow how many of you saw

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,399
that movie where you have the mind

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
control and you can prevent someone from

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,399
doing something in your presence

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
i'm not sure that i have the capacity to

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
do that but sometimes i believe that i

26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
do so that's fun

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,559
um quick quote by an incredible social

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,760
engineer how many of you know

29
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
christopher had naggy

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
one maybe two of you super hard to see

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
out there with all these lights these

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,039
are awesome lights everyone must be able

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,520
to see me really well um

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
so christopher had naggy is a wonderful

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
social engineer he runs the social

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,080
engineering

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
challenges at defcon has for a long time

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
has done some amazing work written

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
several books if you're looking for

40
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,439
something to get started on social

41
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
engineering i recommend his stuff um his

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
organization at social-engineer.org also

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
has some great resources but one of the

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
things that's on there is this

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
definition of social engineering which i

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,280
like quite a bit he said that social

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,119
engineering is any act that influences a

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
person to take an action that may or may

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
not be in their best interests

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
when i read that of course

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
the linguist in me has a little bit of a

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
problem with that and that little bit of

53
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,759
a problem is if you're going to say it

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
may or may not be

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
i'm not sure you need to include that so

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,200
simplifying that just a little bit i

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
would say social engineering is simply

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
influence when you use influence to

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,840
influence another person you are

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
essentially doing some social

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
engineering things and there are of

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
course a couple of different kinds of

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
social engineering there's the great

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
kind of social engineering that helps

65
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
people to do good things for those of

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,759
you who are parents you probably know

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,360
this story i have to teach my children

68
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
to wash their hands

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
i do that a lot and maybe you do too

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,040
that's social engineering i'm trying to

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520
influence them to make better decisions

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
and make good habits today during this

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,239
talk i'm also going to try to influence

74
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,120
you

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
to make certain changes and habits um

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
fair game i'm letting you know in

77
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
advance so hopefully that resolves a

78
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
couple of ethical qualms um there are so

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
are also different kinds of social

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
engineering that maybe are in the less

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
benevolent sorts of things but the

82
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
trickster sorts of things this is so

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
funny i'm sure all of you are laughing

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
at this sign when you read it that says

85
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
don't read this or maybe you're not

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
because you don't think that's very

87
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
funny but um some of the things that are

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
uh encountered inside of social

89
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
engineering end up being this sort of

90
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
um

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
humorous uh things and then the the last

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
kind of social engineering of course is

93
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
the dangerous kind and that's the one

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
that most of us tend to worry about and

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,959
uh and think about when we think about

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,720
social engineering

97
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,159
with that being said how many of you are

98
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,879
here for story time

99
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,400
i know that there was some confusion on

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
the on the schedule for sketch and the

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
title said one thing in the description

102
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
said something else but we're going to

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
talk about stories for social

104
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
engineering things that i did for social

105
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
engineering and ways that i was socially

106
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
engineered and i hope that you have fun

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,200
with some of these things so the first

108
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
part i want to share with you is

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,599
i have to be honest coming up with these

110
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
stories is incredibly hard in the middle

111
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
of a global pandemic kovid made this

112
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
really hard for me because usually my

113
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,840
mo for doing social engineering tests

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
and experiments is going out and talking

115
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
to people

116
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
and when you don't get to go out and

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
talk to people

118
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,159
it makes that really difficult

119
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
nonetheless i have a couple of stories

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,720
that i'd like to share with you and

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,159
we're going to start with

122
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,599
fast food

123
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
how many of you like to eat fast food

124
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
all right some people shameless that's

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
great good for you

126
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
i sometimes eat fast food and sometimes

127
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,599
when i go to fast food and i'm

128
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
placing my order

129
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,040
i notice

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
that

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
as i'm placing my order i think about it

132
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
in a different way than the person who's

133
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
receiving my order

134
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
and at times that causes a lot of

135
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,959
confusion

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
so i wanted to experiment and determine

137
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
whether or not i could use social

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
engineering to improve that experience

139
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
both for myself and for the employee who

140
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
was helping me

141
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
next story

142
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
as a hacker or a

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
cyber security professional

144
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
i notice things and you may notice this

145
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
too when you go to certain places you

146
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
start to see things that you say wait a

147
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
minute that's a problem i should

148
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
probably tell someone for example when

149
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
you go to

150
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
a restaurant or to a store and you see

151
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
an electronic display that is showing

152
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
very sensitive information for the

153
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
organization that's using that or the

154
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
operating system of whatever's running

155
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
on that display i like to

156
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
as a cyber security professional try and

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
do the right thing with responsible

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
disclosure and go to the people who are

159
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
working at that institution and say hey

160
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,919
as a cyber security professional as a

161
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
hacker if you will

162
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
i'd like you to know that i noticed this

163
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
thing i noticed that you're displaying

164
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
the operating system or there's a

165
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
problem with your windows display where

166
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
you're doing your team viewer to show

167
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
this thing

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
next story

169
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
i got a call just a couple weeks ago

170
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
from an organization claiming to be

171
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
rocky mountain power how many of you got

172
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,520
that call a couple of you

173
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
saying

174
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
that i was late on my payments

175
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,919
and that if i didn't make a payment in

176
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
the next 45 minutes

177
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
my electricity would be shut off

178
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
that's a that's a hard thing to deal

179
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
with um and i certainly felt it the

180
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,199
hackers

181
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,880
all right can we see that yes here's a

182
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
vulnerability in the firewall

183
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
can you pump that volume just a bit

184
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
yes

185
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
i really appreciate the ip address that

186
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
starts with four five nine now we're in

187
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,360
never doubted you

188
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
now let's see who's behind the curtain

189
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
wait something's wrong

190
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
what is it

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
we didn't hack in we were let in

192
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,140
it's a honey pot

193
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,339
[Music]

194
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
program is sophisticated they're using a

195
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
worm to infect any devices connected to

196
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,360
our private network

197
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
including our phones

198
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,639
you're listening to us right now destroy

199
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,350
your phone wait you know how to find me

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,479
all right so um if you're into

206
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,400
sort of uh the panopticon future and tv

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
you might want to check that show out

208
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
how many of you seen that show before

209
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
a lot of you all right

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
very interesting situation where

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,479
somebody has a situation where they

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,000
think they're in control and they find

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
out they're really not

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
which may have some bearing on this

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
story

216
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
and someone listening in

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,759
next i want to talk a little bit about

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
the whole idea of mirroring how many of

219
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,879
you are familiar with the concept of

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
mirroring

221
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
lots of you raising your hands right now

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
you're doing it yes you figured it out

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
um when we're in social situations we

224
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
tend to mimic other people especially

225
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
when we're getting along really well

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
and

227
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,639
i decided to try that out with my

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
children they're great social engineers

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
and wanted to see if i could get some

230
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
mirroring to happen with them

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
next

232
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,879
story

233
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,520
badges for saint kahn everyone has one

234
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
hopefully

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
unless you have one of the the temporary

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,000
passes you have a badge hanging around

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
your neck super awesome badge mike and

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,160
the team did amazing work to make that

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,039
happen

240
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,599
we got those and started hooking that up

241
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,080
to the registration system at

242
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
possibly the last minute on monday to

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
get everything ready it's always down to

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,679
the wire with sync on and

245
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
as a result

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
we needed to get some devices to be able

247
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
to sync contact information via nfc onto

248
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
the badges to make sure it has your

249
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
contact information

250
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
and

251
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
we didn't have those devices it was

252
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
really hard to find them so

253
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
we reached out to one of our contacts to

254
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
see if we could get some help

255
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,279
and then next

256
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,279
the talk that i am giving today was

257
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
supposed to be something totally

258
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
different it was going to be me walking

259
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
out on the street talking to people and

260
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
seeing if i could get them to

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
give to me certain information in a

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
socially near

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
social engineering engagement as flags

264
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
we had a list of a number of flags there

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
were five of them including one of those

266
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,120
which is handing your cell phone to me

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
in an unlocked state

268
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,040
while we were unable to do the video

269
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
part of this

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
i was able to do this with a number of

271
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,839
people to see how those results turned

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
out and uh

273
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
i think it was pretty fascinating

274
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
it comes with a price

275
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
i should have told them to run as fast

276
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
as they can run and hide because the

277
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
monsters are coming the human race those

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
are the people i represent i did it on

279
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
their behalf and i should have stopped

280
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
you what does that make you doctor

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
another alien threat don't challenge me

282
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
harriet jones because i'm a completely

283
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,399
new man

284
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,760
i could bring down your government with

285
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
a single word you're the most remarkable

286
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
man i've ever met

287
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
but i don't think you're quite capable

288
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
of that no you're right not a single

289
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
word

290
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,920
just six i don't think so six words stop

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,240
it six

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,360
don't you think she looks tired

293
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
what did he say well nothing really what

294
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,399
did he say

295
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
nothing i don't know doctor

296
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
doctor what did you what was that what

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
did he say what did you say doctor

298
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
doctor

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
all right any whovians out there

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
so i have a friend really good friend

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
who is very much into doctor who

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
and we had lengthy conversations about

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,640
this particular segment

304
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
and we thought isn't it interesting

305
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
that he centered on

306
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
six words

307
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
and so we decided to investigate how

308
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,519
many words does it take

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
to achieve a certain outcome and can you

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
minimize that

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
we wanted to find out how many words

312
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
does it take and

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,959
can you reduce the number of words and

314
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
still get the same outcome

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
and then lastly but perhaps most

316
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,079
importantly

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
i wanted to try an experiment in social

318
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
engineering for kindness a lot of social

319
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
engineering experiments end up being

320
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
uh at the least trying to be benevolent

321
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,079
and at the worst perhaps shaming or

322
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,000
embarrassing people and i wanted to find

323
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
out can we use social engineering to

324
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
create some sort of kindness driven

325
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
scenario

326
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
so those are all the stories that we're

327
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,000
going to talk about we're going to shift

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
gears for just a moment and talk about

329
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
the basics of social engineering

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
there are a number of components that

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
are generally i think helpful in social

332
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
engineering situations

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,440
priming

334
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
i'm sorry preparation framing

335
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
elicitation triggers

336
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,880
motivation

337
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,639
and execution we're going to go through

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,680
each of these pretty quickly because

339
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,959
we're

340
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,120
running a little bit low on time

341
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
so preparation

342
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,200
to prepare for a social engineering

343
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,720
situation you want to make sure that

344
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
you're using everything that is

345
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
available to you and that means

346
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,839
observing everything that you see very

347
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,079
carefully observing the

348
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,760
the facial expressions the hand

349
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
placements all of those things you have

350
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
a fantastic gift of sight if you have

351
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
sight and you can use that to your

352
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
advantage

353
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
the next is listening making sure that

354
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
you're listening to everything that's

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
being said making sure that you're

356
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,079
careful about which words are being used

357
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
and how they're being used and in what

358
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
context

359
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
those two senses end up being i would

360
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
say perhaps the most important in social

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
engineering context most of the social

362
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
engineering that i engage with ends up

363
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
being either

364
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
body language driven or

365
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
spoken language driven there are some

366
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
situations where it can also be digital

367
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
language driven through email or sms and

368
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
things like that and many social

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
engineers prefer that

370
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
it's not really my cup of tea

371
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
and then next doing your research in

372
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,839
advance of any social engineering

373
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
engagement it is best if you can

374
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,519
identify

375
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
what things you want to discover what

376
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,480
things you want to achieve and what are

377
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,079
the components of that what are the

378
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
things that another person might know

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
see or believe about that

380
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
next

381
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
perhaps also not my favorite thing to do

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,480
but throwing things in the waste bin and

383
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,160
putting them out on the street is fair

384
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
game if that's something that gets you

385
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
access to that piece of information

386
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
please consider that

387
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,600
i can say

388
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
that the thing that i have found far

389
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
more palatable for me personally is the

390
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
notion to save the planet and recycle i

391
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,560
have found in a number of institutions

392
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
here in the state

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,800
people who are very good natured trying

394
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
to reuse paper that they have printed

395
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
out perhaps sensitive information on and

396
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
putting it out in places where i can see

397
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,959
it i will grab that and then show it to

398
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,240
them later to let them know that that's

399
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,279
a problem

400
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
with all of these pieces of information

401
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
and preparation generally what you want

402
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
to do is create a profile

403
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,519
for the target of the social engineering

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
experiment some of those things for more

405
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
important and heavier handed social

406
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
engineering tactics require a more

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
complex and detailed profile whereas

408
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
perhaps just getting someone to hand you

409
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
their phone on the street is a simpler

410
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
profile

411
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,320
any questions about that

412
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
as far as preparation does that make

413
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
sense to everybody

414
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
i know we're breezing through this

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
really quick um

416
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
all right next framing

417
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
how many of you have heard of the

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
concept of a world view

419
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,519
a couple of you

420
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
um as you look at the world around you

421
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
you look at it in a certain way

422
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
and that's great it helps you to keep

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,759
things in context and those mental

424
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
heuristics keep you sane

425
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
it's a good thing but that also means

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,079
that you might have certain blind spots

427
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,920
as part of your world view so as far as

428
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
framing

429
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,199
i like to think of this as your world

430
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,079
view

431
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,800
is a vr headset

432
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
you're not always looking at the world

433
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
exactly as it is and many of the vr

434
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,399
headsets i don't know how many of you

435
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,079
have an oculus but when you walk out of

436
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
a certain area inside of that

437
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
it will shut down

438
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
the virtual reality view and turn it

439
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,360
into the camera view automatically when

440
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
you branch outside of your

441
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,839
safety zone it tries to save you

442
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,360
and that's great

443
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
because ultimately if you

444
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
don't have that sort of protection

445
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
you can injure yourself for others i

446
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,199
don't know how many of you have had that

447
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
experience but i've seen plenty of

448
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
people who have been playing some vr

449
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,639
games someone walks through and the

450
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,040
person playing the game has no idea

451
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,959
about their surroundings

452
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
and they will get hit or injured in some

453
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
way that's obviously not something

454
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
that's desirable and ideally clearing

455
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
out of that area is important why all

456
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
this context of vr well when you're

457
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
looking inside of your world view if i

458
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,320
can reshape that world view to gloss

459
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
over certain things

460
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
that prevents you from paying attention

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
to those things and from a social

462
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,959
engineering context that implements

463
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,839
influence and that influences

464
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
distracting your attention away from

465
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
something else

466
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,439
does that make sense

467
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839
all right moving on let's talk a little

468
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,400
bit about triggers and not the age-old

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,599
movie stars but the triggers that happen

470
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,799
inside of your mind

471
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,520
whenever you are in a tense situation

472
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,199
you might have for yourself what is

473
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,599
commonly referred to as a fight or

474
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
flight response

475
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
you've probably felt that

476
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,760
and that is a natural response for the

477
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
human brain

478
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
animals have some sort of reactions like

479
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
that too you can see the fight you can

480
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,919
see the flight

481
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,679
that happens through the limbic system

482
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,679
and this little highlighted area on this

483
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,440
brain scan is the amygdala

484
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,679
for those of you who have done any study

485
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,039
in social engineering you may have heard

486
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
of the term called amygdala hijacking

487
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
this is where people will use emotional

488
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
responses where the

489
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,760
the trigger

490
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
is sent to the amygdala

491
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
and the amygdala as an emotional

492
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,640
response triggers that fight or flight

493
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,600
and as an emotional response it doesn't

494
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
trigger

495
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,799
reason

496
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,919
so

497
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
you have all these different inputs

498
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,679
and with those inputs you get different

499
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
kinds of outputs your brain is a highly

500
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,000
complex thing it has the capacity to

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
think amazing things i'm sure you've

502
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
learned and thought amazing things here

503
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,080
at st con in all the things that you

504
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
have done and when you're sitting there

505
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
thinking through with your rational

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,280
brain you have far more capability to

507
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
remember those things and to think

508
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
clearly about those things when you're

509
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
in a situation where you have an

510
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
emotional response

511
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
those things tend to go away and there

512
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,679
are two reasons why the first one is

513
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,320
that the neural pathway from the inputs

514
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,200
to

515
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,039
the amygdala

516
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,679
is faster than every other part of your

517
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,280
brain

518
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,880
that pathway is so well established that

519
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
you get emotional responses far faster

520
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
and it will

521
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
attempt to at certain scenarios shut

522
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
down other parts of the brain to trigger

523
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,960
that fight or flight response to benefit

524
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,520
you for your safety and survival

525
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
you may have had a situation in your

526
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
life where that was greatly beneficial

527
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,360
where it did actually save your life but

528
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
there are also a number of situations

529
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
where when that occurs it's not really

530
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,760
that beneficial it actually prevents you

531
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
from taking a step outside of that

532
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,280
beautiful vr landscape and realizing

533
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
you're about to hit something or someone

534
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,840
now it's important to understand that

535
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,039
because

536
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
when you're trying to trigger a social

537
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
engineering influence in someone else or

538
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
someone's trying to do that to you you

539
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,440
need to know

540
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
that that is a trigger that they will

541
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240
use on a consistent basis being able to

542
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
use your amygdala or amygdala hijacking

543
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,440
to circumvent

544
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
all of your wonderful

545
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159
rational thinking any questions about

546
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,320
that

547
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,559
absolutely

548
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,440
so

549
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
in the story where i got called by

550
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
someone saying your power bill is

551
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,000
overdue and your power will be turned

552
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,640
off in 45 minutes

553
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
what happens instantly

554
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
i'm thinking

555
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,120
that my slides just turned off i'm

556
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
thinking

557
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
in that moment

558
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,919
i'm in trouble

559
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,039
because

560
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,520
i need this it's cold outside it's hot

561
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,000
outside i need to turn on

562
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,960
my

563
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
lights right my children are home all

564
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
kinds of things like

565
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
the moment that hits me i understand

566
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,600
i've got 45 minutes to figure this out

567
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
that is a fantastic trigger that goes

568
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,200
straight to my emotion right i'm not

569
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,559
thinking through

570
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
well when was the last time that i paid

571
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,400
my bill what form of payment that i use

572
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
those are all rational kinds of thoughts

573
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,120
but thinking oh my goodness i might not

574
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
have power

575
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
that's emotional and that trigger is far

576
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
faster

577
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
does that make sense

578
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,200
other questions about that

579
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,520
how many of you have felt that or can

580
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,880
recognize that

581
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
you remember having that experience

582
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,039
where oh my goodness i had an emotional

583
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,520
overload and i couldn't think of that

584
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
great um how many of you have had that

585
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
experience where you had like emotional

586
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,960
overload to the point of shock and you

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
couldn't even think clearly for a while

588
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,880
after that usually serious injuries

589
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
accidents those kinds of things happen

590
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,480
i remember having one of those and i'm

591
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,360
thinking

592
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
i am just not okay like my rational

593
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
brain is still sitting somewhere else

594
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
until this whole thing calms down i'm

595
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
not i can't go anywhere or do anything i

596
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
just need somebody to be with me

597
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,400
that's okay that is a human brain thing

598
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
um with that being said it is important

599
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
for you to understand that that is a

600
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,919
tactic that people are going to use for

601
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
social engineering

602
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,000
yes ma'am

603
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,320
yes there is and it comes with practice

604
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
right when you can perhaps hone some of

605
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
those emotional responses to trigger a

606
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
certain other pathway in your brain and

607
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,880
we're probably going to get to the

608
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
neuroplasticity stuff later but i guess

609
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
we'll talk about it now

610
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
being able to rewire your brain to say

611
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
my emotional response for this thing

612
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
means that

613
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,000
and that way you can start to use that

614
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
as a benefit to you instead of shutting

615
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,919
down all rational thinking it can

616
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,480
actually trigger okay now that i have

617
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,240
this emotional response i need to do the

618
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
rational thinking to solve this problem

619
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,240
does that help

620
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
other questions

621
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
all right

622
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,559
next i want to talk a little bit about

623
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,880
motivations for human beings here's a

624
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,360
list of some of my favorites uh in the

625
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,400
background you can see the utah monolith

626
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,520
how many of you heard about the utah

627
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
monolith how many of you went out to see

628
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,280
it

629
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,159
okay

630
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
uh there was

631
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,600
crazy focus

632
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
on this thing

633
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,679
for like a week

634
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,360
and that's the bottom one on the list

635
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,960
social proof

636
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
when other people care about something

637
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
we have this innate desire to care about

638
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
that thing too

639
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,919
it's it's weird right and it seems weird

640
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,320
talking about it but if you think did i

641
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
follow those news stories about the utah

642
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
monolith

643
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
maybe right am i really interested in

644
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,120
some hunk of metal out in the desert

645
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
your rational thinking says no

646
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,279
but your social thinking says well

647
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,720
everyone else is doing it why not

648
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,159
right um authority when you see someone

649
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
who might be

650
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,120
a law enforcement authority or your boss

651
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,719
will you act differently around them

652
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,400
probably

653
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
you don't want to get fired right

654
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,120
social engineers use this very often in

655
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,159
phishing attempts to say i want you to

656
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
transfer this money from this account to

657
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,000
this account says your boss

658
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
now once again in context of this

659
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,080
discussion you're like oh seth i would

660
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,559
never do that right you would never do

661
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,679
that

662
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,520
well when you're in that moment and the

663
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
emotional response comes up you might

664
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
not get to think that

665
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
and that's why it's important to to

666
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
prepare for this um

667
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,440
avoidance people do things to avoid

668
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,679
certain consequences

669
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,360
rather than suffering some sort of

670
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
emotional distress they'd rather just

671
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
not participate in this thing

672
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
a lot of people for their motivations

673
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
have commitment and consistency i'll be

674
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,799
honest this one works great with me

675
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,679
i love to think that what i say is what

676
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,080
i will do and my children know this

677
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
they absolutely use this to own me they

678
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
say dad you promised you would read two

679
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,039
books

680
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
tonight

681
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
and i have to think back and say

682
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
yes i did

683
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
i will i will do that right

684
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,679
concession when you give something up

685
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,120
you are more likely to give something

686
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,799
else up

687
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,279
it's just how your brain works

688
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,159
fear

689
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,679
and and this might tie into some of the

690
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,200
authority but other kinds of things as

691
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,159
well

692
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,960
perhaps the fear of injury or harm

693
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
fear is perhaps one of the most powerful

694
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,720
motivators on this list because of its

695
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,960
tying to emotional response and the

696
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,480
fight-or-flight syndrome it is also

697
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
the worst motivator from a social

698
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,799
engineering perspective to use

699
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,279
this will destroy relationships

700
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
i would encourage you as your budding

701
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,720
social engineers going out in the world

702
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
to do incredible things with your social

703
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,600
engineering skills that you learned

704
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
today

705
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,039
maybe stay away from that one

706
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,559
unless you really want people to hate

707
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
you maybe stay away from that one

708
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
can you tell someone if you don't do

709
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,600
this right now you will get fired

710
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,480
yes

711
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,200
you can and will that incentivize them

712
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
very strongly to go do that thing yes

713
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
and when they find out later that you

714
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
are making that up will they hate you

715
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,279
probably right

716
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,520
greed the nigerian prince scam has been

717
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
around for a long dang time

718
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
and yet

719
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
some of its iterations continue to be

720
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
present why

721
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
it really sounds appealing to be able to

722
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
get something possibly for nothing or

723
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,559
for just doing this small help to

724
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
somebody else

725
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
when you feel obligated you're willing

726
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,919
to do something for someone else if if

727
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,880
you feel it's your duty as part of

728
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
being a citizen or being a member of a

729
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,360
particular identity group you will be

730
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
obliged and feel motivation to do

731
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
certain things

732
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,200
rapport

733
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,919
you do things for people that you like

734
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,200
how many of you are liking me right now

735
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,799
kinda some of you okay

736
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,080
well we'll get to that part later on

737
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
when i make a request um

738
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
reciprocity when someone does something

739
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
for you when they do a favor for you you

740
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
are more likely to do a favor back for

741
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
them

742
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
think in your mind for just a moment

743
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
about the last time someone did you a

744
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,159
favor

745
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,080
if they asked you for a favor

746
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,279
of somewhat equivalent value today right

747
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
now would you do it

748
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,080
yeah you would why because they did you

749
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,640
a favor it just makes sense right

750
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
well

751
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,120
sometimes in some context it does and in

752
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,799
some contexts it doesn't

753
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
and then we already talked about social

754
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,200
proof but scarcity

755
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
when you think that something might run

756
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,679
out

757
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,000
you are more incentivized to do

758
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
something about it

759
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
this isn't just necessarily the toilet

760
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,880
paper scare but

761
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,960
others as well right

762
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
how many of you booked a hotel for this

763
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,559
and when you were there

764
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,640
you saw some message that said five

765
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,399
people have booked this room in the last

766
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,520
hour

767
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,120
it could be five people from all over

768
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,799
the planet for the next 30 years who

769
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,200
booked that room but it makes it feel

770
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,159
like they're about to run out right and

771
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,559
they don't show how many rooms are left

772
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
no they won't show you that it's this

773
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
creation of artificial scarcity

774
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
it's the the disney vault of hoteling

775
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
right

776
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
that feeling of scarcity incentivizes

777
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,399
you to do things that you might not

778
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
normally do

779
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,919
all right so let's talk a little bit

780
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,679
about execution

781
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,919
very often if you want to be really

782
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,520
great at social engineering this is the

783
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,440
step that's the hardest this is the step

784
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
that's the hardest to get into and

785
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
honestly i would say if you want to get

786
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,919
into social engineering just go do it

787
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
ideally do it with someone who's willing

788
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
to play along

789
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,440
but not necessarily someone who knows

790
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
what your objectives are or they'll just

791
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
grant it to you because they're friends

792
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,640
with you and you have great rapport

793
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
but make sure that you try it out

794
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,760
there are a couple of different types of

795
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,279
social engineering attacks and i want to

796
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
talk about those as well for social

797
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
engineering attacks there are in my

798
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,440
opinion

799
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,799
two specific attacks from

800
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,520
from a harmful perspective

801
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
the first one is opportunism

802
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,919
sometimes social engineering attacks are

803
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,520
tuned to you

804
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,919
just because someone needs a target

805
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,120
you will do as well as any other target

806
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,640
and

807
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
sometimes those are targeted toward you

808
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,919
or your organization in particular those

809
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,200
are the ones that are the most dangerous

810
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,399
because those are the people who will

811
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,840
invest far more time in trying to

812
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,159
harm you and your organization

813
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,360
so

814
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,159
you should also know the attack vectors

815
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,640
for social engineering

816
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
there will be

817
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,399
attacks coming in possibly via email for

818
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,679
phishing how many of you have seen a

819
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,360
phishing email before

820
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,880
you'll see another one maybe even before

821
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
the end of the day um how many of you

822
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,360
received a phone call like me

823
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,159
all right how about browsers

824
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,279
trying to get you to click on that link

825
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,600
all right

826
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
usb if you see a usb drive on the ground

827
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
don't pick it up don't plug it in

828
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
and in person which is my personal

829
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,200
favorite

830
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,039
uh i want you

831
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,360
to practice these things

832
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
i want you to practice responding to

833
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,039
these things and to your question in

834
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,880
particular how do you get out of that

835
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,799
amygdala hijacking and the only answer

836
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,200
is you need to practice

837
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,840
neuroplasticity is this process in which

838
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
your brain

839
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,080
can grow and rewire itself

840
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,360
but it only does that through practice

841
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
when someone calls up and asks you to do

842
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,880
something

843
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
you need to have a standard operating

844
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,200
procedure inside your own mind of how do

845
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,399
i handle that

846
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,200
and then every time someone calls up and

847
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
asks you to do something you need to run

848
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,799
that little playbook inside your head

849
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,080
over and over and over again if you do

850
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,640
that when the moment comes that you find

851
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
yourself in a situation where someone is

852
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,600
actually perpetrating a social

853
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
engineering attack against you

854
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,960
your little thing

855
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,760
will kick in and say wait a minute when

856
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
this thing happens

857
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,399
run that code

858
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,399
any questions about that does that make

859
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,480
sense

860
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,679
all right so let's talk a little bit

861
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,279
about story time let's close up these

862
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,720
stories

863
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
fast food

864
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,720
i wanted to find a way to use my fast

865
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,000
food scenario to improve my experience

866
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,480
and so i went to the fast food situation

867
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
and said hey listen

868
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,919
i'd like to order this thing and they

869
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,360
said no that's not what i'm asking for

870
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,120
right now i would ask special questions

871
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
to identify what is it that you see on

872
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,399
your screen because i don't get to see

873
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,919
their screen i have i'm not working at

874
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,320
the fast food restaurant but over a

875
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
period of about four or five visits i

876
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
was able to get fast food done right and

877
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,799
i was able to get it done fast too

878
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,640
because i knew exactly how to answer

879
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,159
every single one of their questions with

880
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,200
the right information every single time

881
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,679
it was fantastic and my order didn't get

882
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,080
screwed up it was just simple and easy

883
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,840
to do

884
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,559
as a hacker going into people's

885
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,159
organizations and saying look i noticed

886
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,240
this thing your your information is

887
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,840
being exposed i expected very commonly

888
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,039
for people to say oh no a hacker i feel

889
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,320
like they're in some sort of slasher

890
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
film or something like that but really

891
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
what i mostly got

892
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,799
was

893
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
let me get back to my job

894
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,559
i don't know if this is part of like the

895
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
whole covid thing it used to be the

896
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,640
other way people were absolutely afraid

897
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,679
of me

898
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
but not anymore people just want to go

899
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,679
back to doing their own thing

900
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,640
with the situation of my power bill

901
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,960
that was overdue

902
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,880
i would love to tell you

903
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,679
that i was doing this like yes i am that

904
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,600
guy and i'm gonna own you

905
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
gotta be honest

906
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
and maybe a little bit ashamed

907
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
but it didn't work out that way the only

908
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,720
thing the only thing that was my

909
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
lifesaver

910
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,000
was that rut

911
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880
that pathway that i carved in my brain

912
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
through neuroplasticity over and over

913
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
and over again how did i do it i know

914
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
that when someone calls me to ask about

915
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
something to do any favor to transfer

916
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,279
any money i say thank you very much i'll

917
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
talk to you later click

918
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
and then i go log into my website

919
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,720
with my password to check that it turns

920
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,399
out that in this particular situation i

921
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
actually had a positive balance with

922
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,279
rocky mountain power

923
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
which is sort of hard to do i don't know

924
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,559
how we got to that but my point is

925
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,120
it definitely wasn't true and i wasn't

926
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,039
saved because i'm some genius about

927
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,480
social engineering and i've done this

928
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
talk for years or i've done all these

929
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,919
experiments and i know how all this

930
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,000
works or my brain's so much better it's

931
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,279
not

932
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,799
my brain is the same kind of brain that

933
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,440
you have what's great about this is i

934
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,039
was able to train that brain to

935
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
understand even when i'm in a situation

936
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,120
where i'm freaking out because oh my

937
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
goodness i'm about to lose power

938
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,519
i was able to say well the solution to

939
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,799
this problem

940
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,480
route this run this code i'm going to go

941
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
log into the website right now

942
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,679
now it helps to do that in a lot of

943
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
other situations where it's low pressure

944
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,280
it helps to do that in a lot of other

945
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,119
situations where there's low pressure

946
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,719
but you can't always do that so i would

947
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,280
say start today

948
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,520
next with our mirroring exercise trying

949
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,199
with my children i want them to mirror

950
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
things and practice that mirroring well

951
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,199
i did that and i did that really well i

952
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
did that so well that at one point my

953
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
wife turned to me and said when you say

954
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,199
the flavor for this dinner is so

955
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,040
incredible do you notice those exact

956
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,199
same words coming out of your children's

957
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
mouths

958
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,560
and i have to admit

959
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,320
she had a point

960
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,399
it was kind of like that

961
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,760
and maybe i've created a bit of a

962
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,440
monster i don't know

963
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,480
all right um let's talk about the badges

964
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,280
we had over a thousand people checking

965
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,918
in

966
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,040
to need badges and we needed devices

967
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
really quickly

968
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
to be able to

969
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
transport the nfc information for every

970
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
single one of you onto your badge and i

971
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
would like to say that we did that

972
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,440
pretty great however

973
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
we would like to give some great thanks

974
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,200
to our hero here and this is not a

975
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
picture of our actual hero

976
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,119
but his name is tristan

977
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
tristan absolutely positively social

978
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,040
engineered me here at this conference

979
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
he was one of the people who was called

980
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,520
as a contact from someone who lives up

981
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,680
in logan utah which for those of you who

982
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,599
don't know is at least two hours away by

983
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,680
driving a long ways away so that's a

984
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,839
four hour round trip

985
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,720
he packaged up a bunch of devices drove

986
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,280
all the way down here waited here while

987
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
i tested it

988
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,440
and sold us devices that we needed to

989
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,200
make this conference run so big round of

990
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
applause for tristan who's not even here

991
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,599
thank you tristan

992
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
tristan did such a great job of social

993
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
engineering not only did he sell me a

994
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,320
number of devices for whatever cut i'm

995
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,560
sure i hope he got

996
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
he was also able to get my email address

997
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,440
from me as a measure of gratitude so

998
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,000
really excited about that

999
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,119
next story for social engineering

1000
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
going out on the street asking people

1001
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,720
can i get some information from you such

1002
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,440
as your email address and can i see your

1003
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
phone unlocked to show you some things i

1004
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,800
tried this on 17 different people and

1005
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
i'm happy to report we have a 100

1006
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
success rate

1007
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
um if you think

1008
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,040
that that's abnormal

1009
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
you don't understand what we're talking

1010
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,280
about at all it's not that these people

1011
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
are foolish or stupid

1012
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
they're not they're normal people what's

1013
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,160
great about this is to understand they

1014
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,400
were put in a situation where either i

1015
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
was out of their frame of reference and

1016
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,079
so they're wearing those little goggles

1017
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
for their vr thinking oh this is a great

1018
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,200
scenario when in fact it's probably not

1019
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,720
and it's very easy to say well

1020
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
i'm sort of doing some sort of amygdala

1021
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,119
hijacking to say are you concerned about

1022
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,720
your security let me look at your phone

1023
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
and tell you what it looks like right

1024
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
being able to do that makes that a

1025
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
challenge for some people and there's

1026
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,560
some level of being distracted

1027
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
when you're distracted by something else

1028
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,400
your focus can generally only be unless

1029
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
you're super powered something on one

1030
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,520
thing

1031
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,880
if that one thing is something that i

1032
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,480
choose and not something that you choose

1033
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
that can be a problem

1034
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,160
next story

1035
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
how many of you know who this character

1036
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,480
is from doctor who

1037
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,680
anyone yes

1038
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
yes who knows every single time holds up

1039
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,839
the card what does she say

1040
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,880
anyone

1041
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,280
we're gonna look it up

1042
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,160
how about harriet jones

1043
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,280
she's the prime minister in the earlier

1044
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,240
clip

1045
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
and doctor who says he can take down her

1046
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,920
government with six words

1047
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,599
pretty bold statement well

1048
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,280
my friend and i decided to make a game

1049
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,960
out of it we call it the harriet jones

1050
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,200
game or the six words game either name

1051
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,599
is fine and we identify and created

1052
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,440
profiles about a number of different

1053
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
people to identify what are the things

1054
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
we know about them as a social

1055
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
engineering engagement for our common

1056
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,440
acquaintances we put this in a google

1057
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,920
sheets or google docs and put together

1058
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
these profiles and decided can we create

1059
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,800
a situation where six words is enough to

1060
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,119
get an outcome and the answer of course

1061
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
is yes

1062
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,079
and the yes is for cookies when you are

1063
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
in a social scenario and you bring

1064
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,839
cookies would you like to stop people

1065
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,680
from taking another cookie

1066
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,200
you can with just six words

1067
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
i suppose it's okay for you to have

1068
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,560
another

1069
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
i suppose you can have another

1070
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
if you say those words it makes them

1071
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
think oh my goodness that wasn't the

1072
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,560
plan am i taking too many am i taking

1073
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,480
something from someone else

1074
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,839
and that social pressure hits

1075
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,680
i probably shouldn't take another cookie

1076
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
in fact if you say it at the right

1077
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,720
moment you can get it while the cookie

1078
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,920
is in their hand and they'll put it back

1079
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,400
on the plate

1080
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,160
now that's all in good fun but let's

1081
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,520
talk seriously

1082
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,839
i want to suggest that the

1083
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,359
most important experiment that i did

1084
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,640
with social engineering over the past

1085
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,240
little while is the experiment in

1086
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,200
kindness and finding ways to use that

1087
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,079
social engineering to generate sincere

1088
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,720
joy for the people that i interact with

1089
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
and that comes down to my request for

1090
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
you on the little playlist inside your

1091
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
head i'm going to make a request for a

1092
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,440
song

1093
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,359
if you are into trite phrases here's the

1094
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,760
one for you do one thing every day that

1095
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,359
scares you and the thing that i want you

1096
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,400
to do today

1097
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
is social engineer someone

1098
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
so i'm going to order something slightly

1099
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,520
off the menu and that is

1100
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,920
i want you to generate some happiness

1101
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
i want you to find someone today where

1102
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,599
you can use some of the tactics that you

1103
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,119
have learned today

1104
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,200
and create a situation that makes

1105
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,960
someone happy

1106
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,040
i think you'll find that you have a

1107
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
superpower

1108
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
you can be a superhero that no one

1109
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,079
expected

1110
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,480
in the world today especially in a

1111
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
post-pandemic world we have a lot of

1112
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,880
people who are struggling and they need

1113
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,240
someone who can be that kind of

1114
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,960
superhero i believe that you can be that

1115
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,720
kind of superhero i believe that you can

1116
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,480
create that kind of happiness and joy in

1117
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,960
people all around you and all it takes

1118
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,359
is practicing these things

1119
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,040
that's all i have for you today so thank

1120
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,319
you and i can take some questions if

1121
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,640
you'd like

1122
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
yes

1123
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,520
thank you very much

1124
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,480
i'm glad you enjoyed it

1125
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,240
and and you see how quick that amygdala

1126
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,000
was like oh yeah greed i love that

1127
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,839
praise yes thank you

1128
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,439
i didn't even have to think about it

1129
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
um what do you mean what about the three

1130
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,280
percent who are sociopaths

1131
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,720
um

1132
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,720
so

1133
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,280
that's a great question um first of all

1134
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
there's a fantastic ted talk i think

1135
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
it's a ted talk about it's a ted talk

1136
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,119
thank you a ted talk about sociopaths um

1137
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,720
fascinating i'm not sure if any of it's

1138
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,240
true i can't like vouch for any of that

1139
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,599
information but i would suggest that you

1140
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,359
watch that because the definition of

1141
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,560
sociopath

1142
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
may be up for grabs

1143
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,240
um with that being said if you think

1144
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,079
that you can't social engineer a ceo

1145
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,079
into something you've never met a ceo

1146
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,880
like even the psychopaths like i don't

1147
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,640
care if your amygdala functions in a

1148
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,920
different way i'd love to meet you

1149
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
and we can have lunch sometime and we'll

1150
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,319
see how that really works because

1151
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,200
i mean

1152
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,359
i gotta be honest i study this stuff all

1153
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,680
the time and in this talk i talked about

1154
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,839
ways where i was absolutely owned by my

1155
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,760
children by some person calling me on

1156
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
the phone

1157
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,800
i know this stuff

1158
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
i know this stuff

1159
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,400
and it doesn't matter if you haven't

1160
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,960
practiced that way to escape you're in

1161
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
trouble at some point that will come to

1162
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
your doorstep

1163
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
maybe that's a little bit i don't know

1164
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
alarmist but i'm sorry that that's kind

1165
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,599
of the way that i see it right there

1166
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,640
there will be someone who's going to

1167
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,440
call you and try and get that

1168
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
information from you it's going to

1169
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,560
happen so be prepared and if you know

1170
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,480
you happen to be a sociopath maybe the

1171
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,160
mechanism for getting in is a little bit

1172
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,119
different

1173
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,920
but

1174
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,000
the general structure of the brain

1175
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
probably remains the same the function

1176
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,119
might be slightly different but i don't

1177
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,160
think it's going to be significantly

1178
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
different does that answer your question

1179
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,680
okay

1180
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,319
yes over here

1181
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,040
how do you know if you practiced enough

1182
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,640
to know that you're good enough

1183
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
the answer to that question definitively

1184
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,480
is when someone calls and tries to own

1185
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,880
you you make the right choice

1186
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,839
um

1187
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,640
outside of that

1188
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,240
i don't know

1189
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,880
i mean the the reality is you want to do

1190
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,200
enough table top exercises inside your

1191
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,119
own head to make that work and i don't

1192
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,160
know what that number is

1193
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,680
some of the greatest social engineers

1194
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,800
that i know

1195
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,960
have had situations where they have been

1196
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,800
socially engineered

1197
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
so i i don't know that we have the like

1198
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,400
the upper bound limit if you've done

1199
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
this a million times then you're safe i

1200
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,240
don't know that it works like that

1201
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
um what i can say is when you establish

1202
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
the neural pathways the stronger those

1203
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,040
pathways are the less likely you are to

1204
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,800
be susceptible to it yeah english

1205
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,480
any other questions yes right here

1206
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,800
do i troll people with emails or phone

1207
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,280
calls um

1208
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,440
thanks babe um

1209
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
yes

1210
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,839
but but not frequently um i'm far more

1211
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,280
of an in-person kind of thing and

1212
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,560
actually

1213
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
in in this conference in 2018 i was

1214
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,720
asked sort of that question like someone

1215
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
asked do you do threat modeling with

1216
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
like people around the the dinner table

1217
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,079
at thanksgiving dinner with your family

1218
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,599
and i was like no but that's a great

1219
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,560
idea

1220
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,800
so in 2019 i actually gave a talk about

1221
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,480
doing that very thing

1222
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,160
i'm interested in doing that but i i

1223
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,839
also

1224
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,839
this is a really um i would say

1225
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,480
strenuous ethical concern for me because

1226
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,920
when you learn how to do these things

1227
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,119
you can absolutely exploit people and

1228
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,560
i have serious concerns with that i

1229
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
don't think that's okay i don't think

1230
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,520
that you should do that either i would

1231
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,640
encourage you to be ethical and maybe

1232
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,079
introduce yourself to some of the ethics

1233
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,160
around social engineering there's some

1234
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,359
great things to learn about that we

1235
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,440
didn't talk a whole lot about that today

1236
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,200
but

1237
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,119
yeah and there are some legal

1238
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,440
ramifications for that too certain kinds

1239
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,680
of pre-texting or sending emails can be

1240
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,560
illegal so before you you know jump all

1241
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,760
the way into that and say i'm going to

1242
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,079
make a splash in the world

1243
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,960
make sure you have the right

1244
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,400
authorization to do that or you can end

1245
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,839
up in some serious trouble does that

1246
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,359
answer your question

1247
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,000
other questions

1248
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,200
i'm here in the back

1249
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,720
here

1250
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,560
oh i can see you now sorry

1251
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,440
hi

1252
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,400
hi

1253
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,640
so my question is just you said even

1254
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,560
master social engineers have been

1255
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,480
socially engineered so what's the

1256
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,640
threshold like because if you ask me oh

1257
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,920
could i just make a phone call on your

1258
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,599
phone i totally would hand you my phone

1259
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,359
unlocked and everything so what's the

1260
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,800
threshold

1261
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040
what's the threshold i i the answer is i

1262
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
don't know i've never met someone who

1263
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,040
was completely impervious to that what i

1264
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,119
have done is met people who in a

1265
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,760
specific situation were impervious to

1266
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,720
that

1267
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
all right if you say well

1268
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,160
the the thing that i'm worried about is

1269
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,839
the information on my phone that someone

1270
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,760
might be able to get to so i'm not going

1271
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,839
to hand my phone to someone unlocked you

1272
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,119
can practice that and you can be the

1273
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,640
world's greatest expert on never handing

1274
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
your phone to anyone unlocked that's a

1275
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,319
task that you can solve if you're trying

1276
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,200
to say like can i make myself impervious

1277
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,079
to social engineering in general i think

1278
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,119
the answer to that is definitively no

1279
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,280
however you can make it better by

1280
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,440
practicing all the little pieces of it

1281
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
does that make sense

1282
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,319
that's a sort of answer

1283
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,000
i'm not trying to be evasive it's just

1284
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,920
that's kind of the way it is

1285
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,680
yes go ahead this isn't really a

1286
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,280
question but just fall to what you said

1287
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,760
i expect that if you could make yourself

1288
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,200
completely impervious to social

1289
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,880
engineering you would no longer fit in

1290
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,560
with society

1291
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,760
because you couldn't adapt i i couldn't

1292
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,560
say i don't know but um some might say

1293
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
that i'm already having struggles with

1294
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,400
that so

1295
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,200
it is what it is

1296
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
all right other questions we got one

1297
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,760
more minute

1298
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,760
yes

1299
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
resources to learn more about social

1300
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,040
engineering

1301
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,640
um i would say christopher had naggy's

1302
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,480
site social engineer.org has some great

1303
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,079
resources on it

1304
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,440
there's some interesting wikipedia

1305
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,839
articles on it um

1306
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,680
there are some great ted talks on it as

1307
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,440
well i would say

1308
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,920
it's a great thing to do some research

1309
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,440
on it and learn about it

1310
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,200
but to be honest

1311
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,599
nothing works quite the same way as

1312
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,280
being engaged in it whether you're the

1313
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,559
target or the perpetrator so to speak

1314
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,720
whether you're the the engineer or the

1315
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
engineer it doesn't matter like being

1316
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,720
able to practice through that

1317
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,480
and you know if you have someone in your

1318
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,920
life who's willing to go through that

1319
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,079
sort of

1320
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,599
chaos with you

1321
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,880
that could be really fun i mean i talked

1322
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,319
about my friend where we put together

1323
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,079
these ideas and profiles about people

1324
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,280
and we tried to figure out how do we get

1325
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,839
someone to do something in six words

1326
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,200
we did it

1327
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,040
and we're a whole lot better

1328
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,559
communicators because of it it's not

1329
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,800
just that we were able to you know get

1330
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,440
people to put cookies down but we we

1331
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,880
became better communicators and we're

1332
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,640
better understanding of like the words

1333
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,680
that we're using we're more careful

1334
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,200
about it now so there are other benefits

1335
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,800
to it as well

1336
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,920
thank you everyone really appreciate

1337
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,079
your time

1338
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,819
[Applause]
