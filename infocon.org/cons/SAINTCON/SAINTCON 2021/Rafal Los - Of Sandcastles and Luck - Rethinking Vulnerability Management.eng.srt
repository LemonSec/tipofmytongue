1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,000
this is um

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
best described as about 20 years of

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,359
anger distilled down in the knowledge

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,400
um

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,760
mainly because i've been doing this for

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
so long at this point when when we go

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
through the same problems over again

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
it's like ptsd but without the bullets

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,840
um so

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
of saying castles and lock is is i say

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
rethinking vulnerability management that

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,160
may be a bit generous it may be just

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,359
actually finally thinking about

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
vulnerability management um a little bit

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
about anybody know who i am

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,079
it has been a while since i've done some

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
public speaking so um raffles i'm

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,600
currently the vice president chief

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,040
security strategist of a company here

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,559
locally that nobody has ever heard of

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,600
even though we've been around for about

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
20 years called livestream anybody know

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
us

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
what too yes

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,920
ah we do wonderful marketing um but now

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
you know us okay we're just up the

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
street in salt lake city um

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,840
i hosted down the security rabbit hole

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
podcast i have owned that for 10 years

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
we are in the top one and a half percent

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,920
of all podcasts globally that's awesome

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
i'm almost as cool as joe rogan but with

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
more hair

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,200
um

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
wow tough crowd okay

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
there we go you guys woke up okay joe

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,920
rogan jokes got it um i've been about

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
i've been in the industry roughly 25

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
years although it wasn't cyber security

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
back then

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,000
um

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
if you are

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,920
if you are a pix uh 2u series with a

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
floppy drive old raise your hand

45
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
my people okay

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,479
right so that's what we did we we

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,759
installed things physically and they

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,840
were big and they had fans

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
all right i will give you guys a brief

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,400
history of time as i see it relevant to

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
this

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
you're welcome to ask questions uh make

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
snide comments and or laugh the laughter

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
is always better in the morning

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
and so

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,799
vulnerability management early 1990s we

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
have we had bug track and fd anybody

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
remember those

59
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
yikes okay they're still exist

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
uh setlist.org i think still has it uh

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
and that was what we called winning okay

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,079
that's where we got our vulnerability

63
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,520
information that's what we got it moved

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,320
down to 2000s and we had remote

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
vulnerability scanning it was awesome it

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,399
was revolutionary but we used

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,680
spreadsheets

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
and that sucked but we were eventually

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
going to get over that right and and

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
then that brought us rejoicing name the

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,519
movie

72
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,800
thank you

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
love it this is going to be good

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
if you guys don't understand the

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
reference money python and the holy

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
grail will be the greatest thing you've

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
ever seen or you will hate it more than

78
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
life itself

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
figure out which okay it's like a side

80
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
of the room you have to pick at some

81
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
point all right moving on to the 2010s

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
we did remote vulnerability scanning in

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
addition to local vulnerability scanning

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
but we still had spreadsheets and that

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
is inexplicable i'm not quite sure why

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
spreadsheets lasted that long but the

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
good news is in 2020s we've got remote

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
we've got local we've got vulnerability

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
management tools and damn it we're still

90
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
stuck in spreadsheets

91
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,239
this is the source of my rage okay this

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
is why i i i said this is about 25 years

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
distilled down into a talk of some

94
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,840
knowledge because i don't understand why

95
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
spreadsheets arguably are the universal

96
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
tool for everything we do

97
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
however

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
they are terrible for what we're trying

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
to accomplish okay so there are three

100
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
unfortunate trends around here all right

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
the first one is

102
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
if you're playing along at home yes we

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
are primarily focused on spreadsheets

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,000
and that is a terrible terrible

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
pox on us all

106
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,519
because if you've ever tried to do

107
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
spreadsheet hell and what i mean by that

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
is you create a spreadsheet you create a

109
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
really good table you send it to

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
somebody

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,840
and then they send it to somebody and

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
you get it back and you don't know

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
what's changed

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,000
or why

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
or why half the tables are now or half

116
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
the rows are now missing right this it's

117
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
not a way to run a railroad the second

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,519
one is

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,920
when we say vulnerability management by

120
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
and large most people in enterprise

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
security think patch management yes or

122
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,319
no raise your hand for yes

123
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
okay the rest of you are either fooling

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,439
yourselves or working a better company

125
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
than i've worked with that's good uh

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
well one of those is good

127
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,879
um

128
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
vulnerability management tends to be hey

129
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
how many patches do we have missing

130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
and while that's not great

131
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
it's better than

132
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,160
one

133
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,238
reply i got about a

134
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
four or five months ago

135
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
smallish company about 300 people

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
i was told that they have the all of

137
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
their laptops have auto update on so

138
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,880
they don't need to do vulnerability

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,479
management because they don't exist

140
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
that's one of those conversations where

141
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,720
you go

142
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
okay

143
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
thank you have a great day

144
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
because there's not really a better

145
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
answer to that the three the third part

146
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
of this and this may surprise you there

147
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
is crap for accountability out there

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
okay

149
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,479
excellent one of my best friends from

150
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,600
high school is actually the writer on

151
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
this show and it's awesome some of the

152
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
ideas that are coming next are fantastic

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
um so

154
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,600
there's crap for accountability there

155
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
really is right we scan we dump the

156
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
spreadsheet we email out sometimes it

157
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,680
gets fixed

158
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,919
sometimes it doesn't

159
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
who gets it what happens to it no idea

160
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,440
right

161
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
so faced with the lack of fundamentals

162
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
all right because we can't do the basic

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,400
things right like track the closure we

164
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
can't track how to slas and stuff like

165
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
that we've decided that the way to solve

166
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
that is by adding complexity

167
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,639
good

168
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
so

169
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,600
yes we've decided we're going to add

170
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
complexity

171
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,840
and the truth is it has evolved ah

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
they do that to me every once in a while

173
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,919
because they know i hate this movie um

174
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
so it has involved evolved skipping

175
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
through

176
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
so long long long ago there were a

177
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
handful of stationary assets right

178
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
there was low entropy which means there

179
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
was a very low volume of change a rate

180
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,280
of change

181
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
you had a couple of choices you could be

182
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,039
windows 95 or windows nt

183
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
some of you still are

184
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,400
see that's a nervous laugh

185
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
i was at a doctor's office for one of my

186
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
kids appointments recently and they

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
whipped out a workstation with windows

188
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
xp on it

189
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,599
yeah i bet that's hypocompliant

190
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
i mean you know the good news though is

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
there's probably no current exploits for

192
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,080
that

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
i mean

194
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
so and there are a few applications so i

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
look when i started this in this

196
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
industry we had desktops no everybody

197
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
didn't carry laptops or their entire

198
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,199
corporate it infrastructure on one of

199
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,479
these devices

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,840
um

201
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
and so it wasn't too bad but the problem

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
is it was still hard right because you

203
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
had to chase people down individually

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
you had to go okay did you know there

205
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
wasn't patch tuesday was patch every day

206
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
uh and you know responsible disclosure

207
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
arguably still not solved but you know

208
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
it was an idea at least

209
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,960
and so the problem is today

210
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
we have mobile assets how many of you

211
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
guys have fully mobile workforces

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
okay how many of you guys are planning

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,039
on there i'm doing that

214
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,840
yeah

215
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
i have news for you this pandemic is

216
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
going to make everybody fully mobile or

217
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
reasonably mobile at some point

218
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
right

219
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
we have cloud uh that means anybody with

220
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
a credit card in your organization now

221
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
creates infrastructure that's cool

222
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,680
uh we have varied os's because there are

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
7 000 flavors of linux and now

224
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,639
apparently 3 200 flavors of windows and

225
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
mac os is doing working hard to catch up

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
uh and we have a massive amount of

227
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
applications we have high entropy and so

228
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,280
you look like one of these characters

229
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
where you're running around your hair is

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
on fire um you know and i have two too

231
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
too many conversations that start with

232
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
i have too many things i don't know

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
about

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
and there was a wise military uh

235
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
general i believe that said you know

236
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
it's not the unknowns it'll kill you

237
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
it's the unknowns that you don't know

238
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,840
about what it'll kill you the unknown

239
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,639
unknowns

240
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
because

241
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,599
there's the only thing that's worse than

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
a system that you know is insecure is

243
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
the 17 that you don't know about

244
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,759
and that's where a lot of our breaches

245
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,280
come from so i've got some bad news

246
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
right this is going to keep getting

247
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
worse

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
we are past the point where it is going

249
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,039
to be

250
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,640
somebody said well we can just reign in

251
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
i.t i have news for you

252
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
that's not a thing

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,519
okay

254
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,679
when in 30 seconds or less you can stand

255
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,279
up 10 000 virtual systems

256
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
reigning in is not something you're

257
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
going to be doing

258
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
so the good news is i can there's a peak

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
behind the curtain or

260
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
i don't know it's symbolic whatever so

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
i'll give you guys a couple of a couple

262
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
of things that might help

263
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
some things i've learned and some things

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,160
that are counter intuitive i think step

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
one is think outside the patches box

266
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
we have to absolutely get outside of our

267
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
own comfort zone where we've been

268
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
vulnerability management is not missing

269
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
patches

270
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
right

271
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
it's a lot of other things how many of

272
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
you guys incorporate

273
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
cloud security posture management into

274
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
vulnerability management

275
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
how about anything any uh uh pen testing

276
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
results

277
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
uh bug bounty programs

278
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
your apsec

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
right

280
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
all of those are vulnerabilities

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
and yet

282
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,600
it's very difficult to put them all in

283
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
the state because the data sets don't

284
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
look the same

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
they don't act the same

286
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,880
it's hard to when you look at the cvss

287
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
it's hard to say okay

288
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,399
what's the cvss score of a ssh session

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
that's got zero zero zero zero

290
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
for access

291
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,839
in

292
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,040
aws anybody

293
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
no idea right

294
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
it's it's whatever you determine it to

295
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
be

296
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
the other thing is tracking and

297
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
reporting is is thing that we figured

298
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
out the reporting part that was easy

299
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,360
we're all like we've started recognizing

300
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
what tracking is but accountability is a

301
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
foreign language

302
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,560
accountability and a long time ago a

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
ciso that i greatly admire um that is

304
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,000
now heading up one of the largest

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
companies in the world uh globally

306
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,279
taught me this if somebody's in the

307
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
company says yeah yeah we're going to

308
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
accept that risk and you just nod along

309
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
and say okay

310
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,519
unless they are an executive or a

311
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
officer of the company i have news for

312
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,560
you they didn't accept the risk you did

313
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
because that falls back to you they

314
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
don't have legal standing to do that

315
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
okay there are issues that go into this

316
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
and the the one that i think is the most

317
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
important out of this and even if you do

318
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
everything else right the life cycle

319
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,760
problem happens

320
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
i'll get back to this in a minute so

321
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
none of this is easy

322
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
absolutely zero point zero percent of

323
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
this is easy but i'm going to walk you

324
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
through the the major parts of the

325
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,079
vulnerability management monster

326
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,560
in the next couple here

327
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
and i'll give you kind of where i think

328
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
we're missing where i think things

329
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
should change and what i think the high

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,519
points are

331
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
again slides will be available recording

332
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
this

333
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
i'm happy to chat with anybody if you've

334
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,240
got questions if you've got

335
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
snarky replies or anecdotes just raise

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
your hand i'll call on you a shout it

337
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
out

338
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,279
this is best when somebody either

339
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
disagrees or agrees or both

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
so like i said i hate preaching so let's

341
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,279
start with identification because

342
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
unknown unknowns suck

343
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
that is a fact how do we define

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
vulnerability

345
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,359
anybody

346
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
you

347
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,399
okay

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
anybody else

349
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
a weakness all right so that's a good

350
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
word

351
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
so in a large company i used to work for

352
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
rhymes with be

353
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
we defined cyber the definition of cyber

354
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
vulnerability as any weakness in an

355
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
organization's i.t infrastructure that

356
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,479
could compromise business operations

357
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
the part that very rarely gets included

358
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,880
is that business operations part okay

359
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
because we look at a say let's say very

360
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
basically we're looking at a patch right

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
if patch tuesday comes around it gets

362
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,760
rated at a you know 99.99 on the badness

363
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
scale

364
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,279
everybody goes oh crap i got to patch

365
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
this and go okay what's the impact to

366
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,240
the business to this

367
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
very rarely do we look at that and

368
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,839
that's a problem

369
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,800
so

370
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
we have right there's three basic parts

371
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
of vulnerability management and

372
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
organizations there's the actual

373
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
patching stuff os and applications from

374
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,839
scanning identification there's

375
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,320
application security itself

376
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,600
and you identify those in the sas das

377
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,560
ras

378
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,079
static application testing dynamic

379
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,120
testing

380
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,920
runtime testing code review

381
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
uh you know all the other development

382
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
design all the other pieces

383
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
and then there's cloud configuration

384
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
right

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
cloud account exposures and errors are a

386
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
big deal there's a gartner stat that

387
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
says

388
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
in next couple of years something like

389
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,240
90 percent or some stupidly high number

390
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,279
of

391
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,120
problems in cloud will be

392
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,639
id10 errors

393
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
no nobody okay

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
that means a problem exists between the

395
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,199
uh keyboard and the uh it's an interface

396
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,639
problem let's put that way

397
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
right

398
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
next so we can scan and identify

399
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,800
everything

400
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,240
if you've got a handle on your cloud

401
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,680
implementation

402
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,360
it's possible to see everything even

403
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
though they don't tell you about

404
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
everything right

405
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
you can hook into vpc flow and literally

406
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,440
see every piece of traffic that goes by

407
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
and identify unique systems

408
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
you can do that on azure you can do that

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
on aws i'm pretty sure you can do that

410
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
on gcp

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
that does it's really hard to do that

412
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
in a mobile workforce with laptops that

413
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,959
works from home because they can plug

414
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,720
their own laptop in

415
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
or they can

416
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
you know at one point i worked for a

417
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,639
company that had this really brilliantly

418
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,800
staunch security posture that all

419
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
laptops were locked down you could not

420
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,480
install anything but corporate software

421
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
on it which means that if you're going

422
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
to you know travel like i do for a

423
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,079
living every week you had to carry two

424
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
laptops

425
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
so i think i solved it because

426
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
everything uh everything that we did

427
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
could be accessible through a web

428
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,320
interface i left my work laptop at work

429
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,519
and just did everything in a web browser

430
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,480
on my personal i win

431
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
and yet

432
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,800
right visibility sucks so look

433
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
just because you don't see it and don't

434
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
and choose not to acknowledge it right

435
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,839
this hear no evil see no he will speak

436
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,959
no evil it doesn't work um

437
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,320
there's also a really good graphic of a

438
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
person with their head in their in the

439
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
sand but this is ah

440
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
wow what was that

441
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
hi can we turn those off thanks

442
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
somebody's playing with lights

443
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,279
good times all right wow

444
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,639
suddenly i'm blinded all right well

445
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,040
hopefully you guys are still here

446
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
mapping your attack surface is extremely

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
important so you've got to work really

448
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,240
hard

449
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,480
to figure out what's out there what

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
versions it is what it's doing and work

451
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,079
really really hard

452
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,239
not to be surprised okay

453
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
the first couple of identification scans

454
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
you do

455
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,040
to find new things

456
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
okay am i is this on

457
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,360
where did i drop off

458
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
wow

459
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,080
probably right around the time the

460
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
lights went squarely cool

461
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
i don't like okay well i'll hold the mic

462
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
can you turn up just a little bit

463
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
can you get a little gain in my

464
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,160
microphone be like m m

465
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,039
okay so yes uh i think there's plenty of

466
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
room in

467
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
the organization for

468
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
uh business impact to be done on either

469
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
side of the aisle the problem is this is

470
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
a more fundamental issue because i t it

471
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
security teams tend to be if you're

472
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,799
under the cto you tend to be an ops team

473
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
security tends to be a sock

474
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
you're not that's not the right place to

475
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
try to do a bia because it's the wrong

476
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
skill set for the people that work there

477
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
okay

478
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
people that understand bits as they fly

479
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
by do not have the same skill set

480
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
broadly speaking i'm sure there's

481
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
exceptions

482
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
to understand the impact of any

483
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
particular group of systems or system to

484
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
the bottom line of a business it's a

485
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,440
different skill set so

486
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,760
i think it's still live there's a

487
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
if you take your security team

488
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
and you split it between um engineering

489
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,559
and architecture

490
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,240
and operations

491
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,840
within engineering and architecture you

492
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,280
create either a super super team or or a

493
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,679
adjacent team which is sort of your it

494
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,200
risk function

495
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
i think that's probably the best place

496
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
for it

497
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,159
i mean if anybody have a

498
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
group that does bia and where does it

499
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,559
live

500
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
yeah i heard

501
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
okay one more time

502
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
compliance

503
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
okay that means you're you're adjacent

504
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
to lawyers i can see that

505
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
anybody

506
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,520
else you have a formal risk function

507
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,039
that's fantastic

508
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,640
there's like two percent of companies in

509
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,159
the world that have that

510
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,280
if you're lucky enough to have that

511
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
that's fantastic

512
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
again adjacent to lawyers great

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
you know there's an old uh joke that one

514
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
of my old ceos used to tell and he's

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
like you know most people think that the

516
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
ceo runs the company that's not true

517
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
it's the lawyers

518
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,000
if you've ever tried to deny a legal

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
team their budget you'll quickly

520
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
understand where the power center of the

521
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
company is

522
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,559
that depends

523
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,760
all right

524
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
data sensitivity is a big deal too

525
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,320
not all data is created equal obviously

526
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
um

527
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
how many of you guys know know the never

528
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,559
before seen

529
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,960
thing that random used to talk about

530
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
marcus random anybody

531
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,039
oh god marcus people have forgotten you

532
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
already

533
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
um

534
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
he created this thing uh he talked about

535
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
how a long time ago he had he travels a

536
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
lot uh and he'd have a security system

537
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
on his house but it was fruitless to put

538
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
one on his door

539
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,280
or you know on his doors or windows

540
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
because

541
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
he had he lived in a kind of a secluded

542
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
area and his neighbors would often just

543
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
walk into his house because that's what

544
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,600
that was that kind of neighbors right so

545
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,840
it makes no sense um and he's got

546
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
animals that you know would use a doggie

547
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,159
door and whatnot and sometimes people

548
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,440
you know he'd be like hey i've lock my

549
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
house accidentally just go through the

550
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
window it's fine i leave them unlocked

551
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
so it's a terrible way to do that

552
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
what he did say was

553
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,200
most of his uh you know most of his uh

554
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
animals and guests don't dig through his

555
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,919
humidor or his fridge so that's where he

556
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,520
put the alarms on

557
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
he's like my cat's not allowed to smoke

558
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
my cigars

559
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
that's fair

560
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,200
unless it's heathcliff

561
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
um

562
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,600
yeah i made that joke

563
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,840
i am that old

564
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,080
um saturday morning cartoons davey

565
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
but um

566
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
looking at all the things that you've

567
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
never seen before right and so really

568
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
the more you know about this this

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,919
identification problem remember that

570
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,360
right the more the more things you know

571
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,799
about this identification problem the

572
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,240
more you recognize that scanning alone

573
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
your ip space your applications doesn't

574
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
solve the problem right we we need

575
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,039
better um we need better tools there are

576
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
lots of tools out there that do

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
uh attack surface mapping and there's

578
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
like 17 variations of this i think

579
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
but think about how

580
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,679
what is all the ip space you own

581
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,919
it usually knows what about all the

582
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,840
domain area space that you own

583
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,120
maybe

584
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
or maybe you have a uh somebody in the

585
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,799
marketing department that decided

586
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,840
they're gonna they needed to stand

587
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,679
something up really quick and they use

588
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,840
their email on goddaddy.com to register

589
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
a domain how are you gonna find that

590
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,439
pretty sure i don't want to work for you

591
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,919
yeah order that right if you're one of

592
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
those companies yes you stand up

593
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,039
customer tenants all day long

594
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
stuff like that exists right so next

595
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
step moving on to what we know cause

596
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,279
trio what is triage

597
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,679
anybody triage

598
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,840
initial assessment and some of us carry

599
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,200
that through

600
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
um because triage by definition is that

601
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
first bla first blush first analysis

602
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
right i tend to condense that because if

603
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,320
we extrapolate into too many steps it

604
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
gets too difficult so i call it the step

605
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
between identification and remediation

606
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
i identify something and go oh crap i go

607
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
okay that's not so bad i've looked at it

608
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
looked at it from different angles it's

609
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,039
not so bad now i know what to do with it

610
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,919
so for me it's the bridge between

611
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,760
i identify something and i decide what

612
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
i'm going to do about it

613
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,720
so

614
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,679
here's the thing there are entirely too

615
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,200
many orgs that skip this

616
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
and usually they rely on tools and what

617
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,400
do we say about tools already

618
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
right they don't solve problems

619
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
so what happens is you scan you dump

620
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
into a god helpless fellow vulnerability

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
management platform

622
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,760
it then tells you this is this one's

623
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
more important this one's next important

624
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,320
and that one's third important the

625
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
problem is that's not how they actually

626
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,400
work

627
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,679
what they do is they you know look up

628
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,600
cvss and some other magic and then they

629
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
tell you these 1700 are the most

630
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,918
important

631
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,360
cool bro

632
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,320
let me know how that works out

633
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
because

634
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
you can't give somebody an i.t 1700

635
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
things you can't give them 10 things to

636
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
do

637
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,360
right

638
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
so distilling that and i believe triage

639
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,520
is still a human-driven process that

640
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
does not mean that there's no room for

641
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,559
automation there absolutely is

642
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
just like if you're talking about threat

643
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
hunting you need the automation to bring

644
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,039
you context

645
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,400
and then the person looks at it and

646
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
makes a mental decision right

647
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
i'm glad there's nobody that's

648
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
as a as of now

649
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,919
trying to sell ai

650
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,039
as a vulnerability management thing

651
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,480
um because that's when i know i'm

652
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,200
getting off the bus

653
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
uh you're gonna you're not gonna okay

654
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
fine i'll go do that later i'll

655
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,000
i will uh i will uh refill my cup and go

656
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
uh go through the vendors later and we

657
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,159
can go make fun of them together um

658
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,679
by the way somebody asked me why i went

659
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,120
to work for a vendor if i rag on them so

660
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,720
much that's exactly why i went to work

661
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,080
for a vendor because we all suck and i

662
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,919
want to make it better

663
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,400
so look we want to add context to raw

664
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,360
findings right you scan you you find a

665
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
patch missing

666
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
you find a an issue where

667
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
you know rdp is open to the world

668
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
cool that's a great idea

669
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,720
uh now what

670
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
when is critical not

671
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
i've asked that question in a million

672
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
rooms and from in a million times

673
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
and the answer is context

674
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,240
when is critical not

675
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,080
when you turn up the mic or talk closer

676
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
to it

677
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
i hate

678
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
this is how they get you they make you

679
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
talk super close to the microphone

680
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
and that's sultry voice no um all right

681
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,559
so

682
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,320
when is critical not critic oh that's

683
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,480
that's good so critical is not critical

684
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
when um

685
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
when you have context added to it

686
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,039
it there's plenty of times in appsec

687
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,960
where a sql injection vulnerability

688
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,399
exposes the in that can expose the

689
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,919
entire database

690
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,799
that's behind a cert based auth or key

691
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
based auth that three people have access

692
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,840
to is not critical

693
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,640
anymore mitigating controls right

694
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,520
so

695
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
we want to assess the context we want to

696
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,240
give it uh asset context

697
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
and data context

698
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
what is the asset how does it relate to

699
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,720
you know is it a dev server is it a

700
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,480
workstation does it belong to somebody

701
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
in finance

702
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,919
uh we used to say oh is it some ad is it

703
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,039
an admin or a secretary's uh workstation

704
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,480
and then we discount it so yeah those

705
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
are don't have a whole lot of data wrong

706
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,720
as somebody's already said today

707
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,159
right that's where that's the easiest

708
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
way to get on everybody's workstation

709
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
because generally speaking they have

710
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,919
access to everybody's calendar

711
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,520
everybody's email box and everything

712
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,760
else

713
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
you want business context that's where

714
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,000
bia comes in and i i say how many of you

715
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,840
guys do business impact analysis and you

716
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,440
know in workshops at companies that go

717
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
how do you do business impact analysis

718
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,600
here

719
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,640
and i sort of get this what

720
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,159
like well you just told me you have a

721
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,600
mature vulnerability management program

722
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,880
but you don't have business impact

723
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,720
analysis at any level

724
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,240
so one of those two things is a lie

725
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
and i have news for you

726
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,960
cvss by itself is not the entire

727
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
equation

728
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,000
right if that's what you're using for

729
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
determination

730
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,120
i feel bad for you

731
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,080
because it's a context-less

732
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
way of looking at a problem

733
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,840
if all flat tires are bad

734
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,919
that means the flat tire on the

735
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
expressway at 9 00 a.m when there's you

736
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
know people zipping by at 90 is the same

737
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,559
as a flat tire in your driveway at 2 00

738
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,559
a.m when you're not in the car

739
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,360
and we know that's not right

740
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
so at a minimum when you're looking at

741
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,760
triage formulas is an exploit published

742
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,919
is there exploit code

743
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,360
right that's generally if it's not exp

744
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,120
is it exploitable

745
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,960
a missing patch for something that's not

746
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,760
exploitable may or may not matter to you

747
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,600
okay for context do you guys remember

748
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,279
the uh and i

749
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,720
why can't i think of it right now the

750
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,799
the processor bugging intel uh spectrum

751
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,760
no

752
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,720
yes

753
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,200
mel spectrum and meltdown right

754
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
everybody freaked the hell out about it

755
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,120
it became the thing that everybody was

756
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,880
concerned about everybody wanted patches

757
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,559
for never mind that you had to try to

758
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,520
patch a piece of silicone

759
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
but people were demanding patches you

760
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
know where the biggest impact

761
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,120
the companies that actually should care

762
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,200
about this

763
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,080
anybody want to have a guess

764
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
data centers

765
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
because the patch was going to take

766
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,760
about 25 per 40 performance out of the

767
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
processor

768
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,919
so you know who should really care

769
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,840
amazon microsoft google

770
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,399
ibm oracle and other irrelevant clouds

771
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,679
sorry i used to work for hp i know what

772
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
that's like um

773
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,120
and the reality is

774
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,159
it was super hard to exploit

775
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,760
and yes eventually there were exploits

776
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
that were less than you know impossible

777
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,440
but it was freaked everybody out

778
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,039
every board was talking about oh my god

779
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,840
what are we going to do how are we going

780
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
to patch this and for

781
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
98 of companies out there the answer was

782
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,840
am i really concerned about this

783
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
is the is there uh is the exploit being

784
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,039
exploited is it actively being exploited

785
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,120
published exploit code is not the same

786
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,840
as circulating exploits

787
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,039
okay

788
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,640
usually you have it used to be like oh

789
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
there's like a 90-day window now there's

790
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
like a 90-second window but

791
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,559
we've thrown people at the problem and

792
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,600
you know

793
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
money is now a thing

794
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,880
can it impact your business process

795
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
if you're facebook and and uh and

796
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,279
there's an exploit somewhere i'm not

797
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,720
saying this happened i'm just saying i'm

798
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
just gonna use this example

799
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,559
right and somebody figures out that they

800
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,679
can uh

801
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,960
screw up your network in such a way that

802
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
your auth

803
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,919
and no other systems can talk to each

804
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,440
other and you know that it locks you not

805
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
only out of the building but out of all

806
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,799
the systems and the systems out of other

807
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,320
systems

808
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,880
that's a bad way to go

809
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,440
that's a rough day weekend week month

810
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,120
does it impact business process yeah i'd

811
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,518
say so

812
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,919
so how many uh so there are there's a

813
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,000
word that my marketing person invented

814
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
complicate i love it because it's

815
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,039
nonsensical it's not a word but it's

816
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
funny and it

817
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,159
explains exactly what i'm trying to say

818
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
here there are so many ways to

819
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,120
complicate things right we can create

820
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
abstract massive risk formulas

821
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,799
that take 25 inputs

822
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,440
that you know look at 17 dimensions of

823
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
any vulnerability

824
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
are they even is this even relevant to

825
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,600
the kind of business that you do

826
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
will it help you get to a decision

827
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
faster and can you defend that decision

828
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
to somebody that says this system has an

829
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,799
outage window of 15 seconds a year

830
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
so some ideas

831
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,840
first i say go simple

832
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
complexity is the enemy of all

833
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
more complex something is the more

834
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
likely it is to be broken the more

835
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
likely it is to be rejected the more

836
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
likely it is for somebody to look at it

837
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,679
and go yeah i'll try to understand that

838
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,080
sometime about this time next year

839
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
over time adding additional context so

840
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,679
maybe you start with

841
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,320
you know cvss plus is it being exploited

842
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
but you got to normalize so not

843
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,399
everything has a cvss score so then what

844
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,399
speed is essential

845
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,080
how often do you guys scan your networks

846
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,439
okay

847
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,799
weekly okay

848
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,440
oh that's interesting

849
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
okay that's a good one actually that's a

850
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,399
that's a good formula do you guys hear

851
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,360
that

852
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
it's based on a criticality window so if

853
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,039
something is critical you've got three

854
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,399
days to patch so they scan every three

855
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,480
days that's a good way

856
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,960
somebody else said something

857
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
anybody say continuously

858
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,760
that guy

859
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,840
continuously is awesome

860
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,760
but when it when you uh the output is

861
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,399
you know 17 000 lines in a spreadsheet

862
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
and it takes you a week to analyze

863
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,120
continuous isn't helping

864
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,679
right

865
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
it's all about finding the needle in the

866
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,919
stack of needles

867
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,000
it really is

868
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
so you're looking at automation some

869
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
form of automation that makes sense

870
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,119
it doesn't over complicate things but

871
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,520
also gives you the necessary context a

872
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,560
way to bring business impact in

873
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
which means um i'm going to use my

874
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
favorite thing it means at some point

875
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,320
you've threat modeled

876
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,839
who's done a threat modeling exercise

877
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,560
here please everybody raise your hands

878
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,918
okay what are the what is what is this

879
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,760
is like i i tried and i failed or i've

880
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,440
read about it once anybody who's on

881
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,359
threat modeling

882
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
okay that's a couple that's better than

883
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
usual

884
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
if you don't threat model odds are you

885
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,159
don't know what what the importance of

886
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,359
anything is in your environment or what

887
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,839
its impact is on things around it

888
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
which makes it really hard to score

889
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
things if you can't score things you're

890
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,480
guessing

891
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,679
and if you're guessing you may as well

892
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,359
be doing magic and if you're doing magic

893
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,199
it's

894
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,919
pardon my french

895
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,960
so

896
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,200
you do triage right okay so then what

897
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,560
then we talk about mitigation

898
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,480
and mitigation generally means all right

899
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
just go fix it right

900
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
i scanned it i found some

901
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,359
vulnerabilities go fix them

902
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,000
how hard could it be

903
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,920
what's our role in the organization as a

904
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
security person

905
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,800
what's your job

906
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,280
what do you do

907
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,160
what's our role in the organization

908
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,119
all right

909
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,000
we're advisors right

910
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,880
so let's keep the um let's keep that in

911
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
mind while we as we go through this your

912
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,680
role as an advisor is important

913
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
so

914
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
when you're looking at mitigation i'm

915
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
going to go back to this

916
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,119
when we look at mitigation

917
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,160
we want to get the deer out of the

918
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,440
headlights

919
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,359
we want to do something

920
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,040
there's a term that we coined a long

921
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,760
time ago called analysis paralysis

922
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
right anybody heard this

923
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,839
where you spend so much time doing

924
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,200
analysis you can't you can't really

925
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
figure out how to move forward because

926
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
you just it just requires more analysis

927
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,680
and then you get more data inputs and

928
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,119
you do more analysis

929
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,400
and by the time you've made a decision

930
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
you're already dead

931
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,280
every slasher movie ever

932
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,560
although they always pick going into the

933
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,839
basement now geico's made an awesome

934
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
commercial about it why can't we just

935
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
get in the running car

936
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
duh let's go hide behind the chainsaws

937
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,839
we're in the basement

938
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,480
always

939
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,720
so our if our role is to advise uh

940
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,160
option one is to mitigate actually fix

941
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
things right

942
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,280
fix it felix

943
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,800
who's got kids

944
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,480
i see you

945
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,599
okay

946
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,560
so it's apply a fix so mitigate

947
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
is two things you can apply an actual

948
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
fix apply the patch make the change

949
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,280
go slap your developer in the back of

950
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,560
the head and said no more rdp to the

951
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,799
world

952
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,599
unfortunately that usually requires a uh

953
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,040
a boot but

954
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,920
um sometimes more

955
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,800
somebody's

956
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
old head of development used to say the

957
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,520
uh

958
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,040
the success of this project depends on

959
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,759
your execution

960
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
i laughed because he didn't understand

961
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
the hilarity of that moment

962
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
so you can apply the fix or

963
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,440
there's an or

964
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,680
i know shocked face i love that squirrel

965
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
that squirrel has been in so many

966
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,640
presentations it's not even funny i

967
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
should owe that squirrel royalty

968
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,839
um

969
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,480
you can also apply mitigating control

970
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
perfect example

971
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
i was talking to a friend a while back

972
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,520
and it's been a couple years probably

973
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,119
about four or five years

974
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,320
i had them on the podcast we were

975
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
talking about uh things that are ultra

976
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,839
legacy right

977
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,480
things that are so old

978
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
most people don't you know they don't

979
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,920
make patches for them or whatever

980
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,880
i was like yeah man there's probably

981
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
still some mt4 boxes around

982
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,079
and you looked at me and said that's

983
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
adorable that you think that's old

984
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,599
uh now uh he worked for uh one of the

985
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,320
top six us banks so keep that in mind

986
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
and um i was like what do you mean he

987
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,560
goes dude i still run foxpro for payroll

988
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,280
those of you that laugh why is that

989
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,599
funny

990
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,800
when did when did foxpro go out of

991
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
circulation

992
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
like 98

993
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,599
right so 20 years later roughly we're

994
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,359
still doing you know

995
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,560
payroll on it that's awesome

996
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,800
but i'm mitigating control around these

997
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,640
things sometimes you can't apply the fix

998
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,400
because a it doesn't exist

999
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,560
or it involves like a couple of jobs ago

1000
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,079
a wrecking ball to go through a building

1001
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,200
and level the things that were in it

1002
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
vms vax machines did not accept patches

1003
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
well so the way we solved that is we ran

1004
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,640
a bulldozer through the building and

1005
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,280
installed nt instead

1006
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
i'm not sure i fixed the problem but it

1007
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,520
was fun

1008
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,320
um

1009
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
applying mitigating controls is

1010
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,280
important because sometimes you can't

1011
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,079
solve it by applying the fix option two

1012
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,400
is defer

1013
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
that means i could do this now but

1014
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
something is is it's either not a high

1015
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
enough risk

1016
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
or my outage window is three months from

1017
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
now and it's only 20 minutes and i'm not

1018
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,320
gonna do it today

1019
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,480
okay let's see fix it later

1020
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,240
it does not mean fix never

1021
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
as quickly as it because we put it in a

1022
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
spreadsheet someplace

1023
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,839
right because that's our universal tool

1024
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
and then we forget about it

1025
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
just disappears

1026
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
it becomes a stuff of legend

1027
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,119
gather around campfires and glowing

1028
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,560
screens and we tell stories about it

1029
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,240
and then all sudden because you know

1030
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,920
when you when you analyzed it there was

1031
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
no exploit available

1032
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,560
there was no exploit code

1033
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
six months later it's being run by a

1034
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,520
worm and everything it touches explodes

1035
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,640
and you're like oh crap do we have

1036
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,040
anything vulnerable to that

1037
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,240
remember when heartbleed was a thing

1038
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
you know why everybody panicked i i

1039
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
didn't understand the panic when harpley

1040
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,359
came out

1041
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,440
because why wouldn't you know because

1042
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
everybody scans their networks why

1043
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
wouldn't you know where you have an old

1044
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,200
open ssl version

1045
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,680
because we don't look at our networks

1046
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,760
that way right

1047
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
okay in that case panic

1048
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
extensively

1049
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
there is an option three anybody know

1050
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,279
what option three is

1051
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,118
except i will also accept drink heavily

1052
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,640
so

1053
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
my favorite person that in the just deal

1054
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,880
with it column some companies will say

1055
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,720
we will accept this risk

1056
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
and that's okay because your role is to

1057
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
advise not to not to necessarily tell

1058
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,359
them

1059
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,280
what to do right so you're advising you

1060
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,200
go this is going to

1061
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,760
jack the company completely and they go

1062
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,520
that's cool but i'm not going to do that

1063
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,119
and some project manager says oh we're

1064
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,480
just going to accept that risk and you

1065
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
go

1066
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,720
okay no don't do that

1067
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
the way to get the way to solve this

1068
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,119
problem of things ending up in the do

1069
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,000
nothing ever

1070
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
to know the legal department draft up a

1071
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,240
document

1072
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,880
to to be able to accept a significant

1073
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,160
now this means that you have to be able

1074
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
to document why something is a critical

1075
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,079
why it has to be fixed

1076
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
okay so that might be a prerequisite for

1077
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,319
some of some people but once you have

1078
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,599
that you go to legal and you go okay

1079
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,839
this is my document how i advise and

1080
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,920
when it's critical this is why it's

1081
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,359
going to be critical and i'm going to

1082
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,119
want somebody to sign off on that

1083
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,200
they're going to go great bring it to me

1084
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
i'll have to review it

1085
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
and then it's going to have to go to

1086
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,680
whoever the vp of that department is

1087
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
i did that many years ago and my accept

1088
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,520
rate

1089
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
went from about 50 percent to about zero

1090
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,520
percent

1091
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,760
because i've been in a cio's office once

1092
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,359
with a project manager that decided that

1093
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,520
they're going to accept that risk

1094
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,880
they did not ex they did not expect

1095
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,800
the business units chief legal counsel

1096
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,280
to be in the room

1097
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
or for that chief legal counsel to

1098
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
educate the cio on why he thinks this is

1099
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,119
a terrible idea

1100
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,280
it was a very short conversation

1101
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,200
it ended with the phrase get out of my

1102
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,440
office what were you thinking

1103
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,000
and we never had it again

1104
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,440
weird

1105
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,880
it turns out people don't want to put

1106
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,240
their jobs at risk for something that

1107
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,880
could actually be done

1108
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
who knew right so

1109
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,240
you're going to want to take that thing

1110
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,960
that you accept add it to the register

1111
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,319
do not forget about it

1112
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,319
is a song don't you forget about me by

1113
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
what

1114
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,720
no

1115
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,359
i have to google what simple minds

1116
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,839
that's right sean thank you very much

1117
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,160
regularly review the defer and accept

1118
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,480
pile

1119
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,599
regularly review the defer and accept

1120
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,119
pile

1121
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,800
and what i mean by that is go through

1122
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
them and look at them if you've got some

1123
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,200
automation in place that automatically

1124
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
adds context

1125
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,640
right something that you could accept or

1126
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
defer

1127
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
because it was a priority three and it

1128
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,640
was down the stack and it's maybe low

1129
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,520
impact may but no exploit code

1130
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,280
suddenly some brilliant young mind

1131
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,720
somewhere

1132
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,480
home on spring break realize that if you

1133
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,839
flip a bit you can now own half the

1134
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
network with it

1135
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,920
and that goes from a weekend it's okay

1136
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,839
to accept to you need to fix that right

1137
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,240
now

1138
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,240
but if you don't have this review

1139
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,520
process if you don't have this written

1140
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,160
down someplace it becomes really

1141
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,079
difficult to get there

1142
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,480
oh by the way if you have this stuff

1143
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,000
written down and you don't review it and

1144
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
you get popped by one of these what you

1145
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,280
have done now is collected evidence

1146
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,079
against your own self

1147
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,520
because then you get to the point well

1148
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,280
you know you had all the data why didn't

1149
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,319
you make the decision to fix it

1150
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,599
that's not a fun question to answer

1151
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
so the recommendations change over time

1152
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,640
what is a hungry caterpillar today

1153
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,119
is a pretty butterfly tomorrow

1154
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,680
or the other way around

1155
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
right what ate my entire tomato plant

1156
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,760
one day

1157
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,119
is suddenly kind of pretty and i can't

1158
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,920
kill it because my daughter likes it

1159
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,160
and the tomato plant's dead anyway

1160
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,880
so when context changes advise and then

1161
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,960
track which brings me to my favorite

1162
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,200
topic in this which is reporting

1163
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,319
um

1164
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,480
this is accountability for dummies

1165
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,160
i jokingly told marketing we're going to

1166
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,920
write a book on vulnerability 101 it's

1167
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
just going to have accountability as the

1168
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
only word on every page and that's it

1169
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,760
because that's that's the only thing

1170
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,880
that matters right if you don't have

1171
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,560
accountability none of this other crap

1172
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,160
i've told you about matters

1173
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,440
because you can have great dashboards

1174
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,800
you can have great triage you can have

1175
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
100 identification you can know

1176
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
everything about your network but if you

1177
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,760
don't have anybody that's accountable

1178
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,040
for fixing it

1179
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
you are going to have a bad time to

1180
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
quote south park there's multiple parts

1181
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
here there's tracking there's metrics

1182
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
and there's accountability so this isn't

1183
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,000
just about getting straight a's

1184
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,560
this is not a race to zero

1185
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,200
vulnerabilities risk doesn't work that

1186
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,240
way

1187
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,599
okay whether we're talking about a

1188
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
pandemic or we're talking about zero

1189
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,359
days

1190
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,200
it doesn't that risk does not go to zero

1191
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,280
just because you wanted to

1192
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,200
you are if you ever get if you ever work

1193
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
in an organization all right take my

1194
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,359
info down call me if you get there if

1195
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,280
you ever get into an organization where

1196
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,119
you do a do a look around and your

1197
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,280
vulnerability list look it has zero on

1198
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,599
it we should have a conversation about

1199
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,079
what your next job should be

1200
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,599
because my advice to you is run like

1201
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,520
hell

1202
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,640
because something's turned off

1203
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,839
no such thing i promise

1204
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,000
so we want to track to service levels uh

1205
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,640
sean indicated earlier here about being

1206
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,760
able to

1207
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,240
uh you know his scanning regimen goes

1208
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,280
along that line right so you've got

1209
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,640
priorities when it when your

1210
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
recommendation is fixed

1211
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,440
p one p two p three very simple

1212
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,800
p one is

1213
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,960
mission critical impact i have another

1214
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,359
slide deck uh from a different type uh

1215
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,960
that has this stuff in it if you want

1216
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,720
that one i think i posted that one to

1217
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,079
slideshare.net

1218
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,760
it's from gsx from a couple weeks ago

1219
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,319
but if it's a p1 it's mission critical

1220
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,480
business impact it's demonstrable i can

1221
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,160
show you that if this thing gets

1222
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
exploited we cannot function as a

1223
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,440
company

1224
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,599
that's it

1225
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,240
we stop we stop existing

1226
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,960
if you ruin the bgp tables

1227
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,400
facebook falls off the face of the

1228
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,880
planet that's it done

1229
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,800
that is a p1

1230
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
a p2 is

1231
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,160
it could have significant business

1232
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,000
impact but i am not sure

1233
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,960
that it's going to be huge it could

1234
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,000
could

1235
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,560
could maybe is a key word have

1236
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,119
significant business impact

1237
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,119
and at b3 is it

1238
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,599
looks like it's a problem

1239
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,520
i don't think it impacts us i do not

1240
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,920
reasonably believe that it impacts us or

1241
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,680
if it does get exploited it will cause

1242
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,599
any business impact

1243
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,400
right

1244
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,520
relate to the bia again

1245
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,000
so we track to resolution or we track to

1246
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,560
slas

1247
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,119
most companies track to resolution

1248
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,480
declare victory and move on

1249
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,200
that's okay

1250
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
but you have to be able to figure out a

1251
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,240
p1 usually within 24 hours

1252
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,599
patch has to be applied fix has to be

1253
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,880
applied

1254
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,119
p2 standard is somewhere around seven

1255
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,440
days calendar not working

1256
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,280
a p3 somewhere within 30 calendar days

1257
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,599
right at defer you get

1258
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,040
60 days and we'll come back to it

1259
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,280
an accept gets ri and the defer and

1260
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,720
accept get reviewed every 30 days

1261
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,280
thereafter or something

1262
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
if you don't have a policy statement

1263
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,079
like that someplace that should be the

1264
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,599
first thing you do

1265
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,880
because that helps you make the case it

1266
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,200
helps you operationalize all this

1267
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,400
metrics report on either progress

1268
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,160
or risk which one do you think is easier

1269
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,559
i'll give you a hint look at everybody

1270
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,599
walking around here in a mask

1271
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,960
right and then look at all the baseball

1272
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,119
stadiums where people sit are a foot and

1273
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,319
a half away from each other screaming at

1274
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,119
the top of their lungs all day

1275
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,880
risk is super hard to understand and

1276
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,319
quantify and convey

1277
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,760
agree

1278
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,240
right we're an industry that revolves

1279
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,079
everything we do around that little four

1280
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,160
letter word

1281
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,800
so it's way easier to convey progress i

1282
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,960
found 50 i patched 20 of them

1283
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,880
awesome

1284
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,079
20 out of 2 out of 5.

1285
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,680
not bad next month i will patch three

1286
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,599
out of five then four out of five

1287
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,960
and then four and out then four out of

1288
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,040
five and then two out of five

1289
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,240
wait that's going backwards yeah it

1290
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,319
happens

1291
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,720
so progress is easy but progress is also

1292
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,160
a liar it doesn't it it does not tell

1293
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,440
you whether you're doing a good job or

1294
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,640
not just means you're fixing stuff

1295
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,559
it's kind of like if you've ever seen

1296
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,839
any of those

1297
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,359
stories done after a bridge collapses

1298
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,440
and injures a bunch of people someplace

1299
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,119
like well we did yearly upkeep on it it

1300
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,000
was you know we fixed every every crack

1301
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,200
meanwhile they're like yeah but the

1302
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
girders were 75 years old and rusted

1303
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,680
through well

1304
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,359
good job you were fixing 100 of things

1305
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,400
you found

1306
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,599
you weren't looking at the important

1307
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,839
stuff

1308
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,839
so metrics that report risk are tough

1309
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,240
those take a lot of time those require

1310
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
bias those require threat modeling those

1311
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,480
require significant work but i promise

1312
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
you those are the most important

1313
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,400
how much risk is in your environment

1314
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,079
break that down by business line of

1315
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,599
business owner

1316
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,359
put it on a dashboard on a screen

1317
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,640
outside your cio's office

1318
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,520
it's great to watch business unit owners

1319
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,960
uh try to outdo each other for who's

1320
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,720
gonna be who's got the you know best

1321
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,000
number

1322
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
because nobody wants to be in the red on

1323
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,400
that

1324
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,240
right hey why are you creating undue

1325
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,599
risk for the company what is wrong with

1326
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,559
you

1327
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,040
accountability keeps you employed

1328
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,680
because if

1329
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,640
monkey poo hits the fan

1330
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,000
the first thing everybody in the company

1331
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,760
does is point at each other

1332
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,359
not my fault

1333
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,200
or they blame the intern

1334
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,040
i love that one that's a great one

1335
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,480
blame the one person in a company that

1336
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,240
has no accountability and guess and does

1337
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,160
not get paid good job dude that's a sign

1338
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,720
to leadership

1339
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,559
so

1340
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,559
when you when you uh

1341
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,319
when you find accountability find

1342
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,480
somebody that can actually accept or

1343
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,440
make a decision right do not own the

1344
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,040
decision

1345
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,880
you are not paid enough to own the

1346
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,119
decision

1347
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,520
i promise you that is not your choice to

1348
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
make

1349
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,079
and they always say look around the room

1350
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,599
if you can't identify the sucker

1351
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,839
it's you

1352
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,640
right

1353
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,559
so if you look around the room

1354
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,480
and everybody's saying yeah i can accept

1355
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,280
that risk

1356
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,400
you're the only one that's going to get

1357
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,599
dumped on

1358
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,599
all right so path forward and some cool

1359
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,880
graphics

1360
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,480
how do we get this plane off the ground

1361
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,119
because god help us it has been 20 some

1362
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,880
odd years that we've been talking about

1363
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,079
this and i feel like we we uh we pushed

1364
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,000
it off the cliff and now like one of the

1365
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,839
engines is kind of working

1366
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,240
uh the wing is sort of about to fall off

1367
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,680
there's no guidance system both the

1368
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,839
pilots are drunk like it's not a good

1369
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,119
situation how do we get this thing off

1370
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,559
the ground so i will tell you remember

1371
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,920
the life cycle focus on a vulnerability

1372
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,760
management life cycle

1373
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,480
identify triage mitigate report and now

1374
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,680
for the one that nobody's going to get

1375
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,319
anybody

1376
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,279
pete and repeat

1377
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,440
fall out boy fans

1378
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,119
one and you didn't recognize him

1379
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,640
he's not in a poster in your bedroom i

1380
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,720
don't know what to tell you

1381
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,880
so it's pete and repeat right do those

1382
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
things over and over and over and over

1383
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,359
again it is not a fun job if you don't

1384
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,960
know how to do it right

1385
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,200
get beyond patching

1386
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,800
and create a triage formula that's

1387
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,599
simple that's effective

1388
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,040
yes buy some automation don't rely on it

1389
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,480
find people that you can hold

1390
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,640
accountable find people that the company

1391
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,880
can hold accountable those people are

1392
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,800
generally not you

1393
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,640
and what that means is make friends with

1394
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,839
lawyers

1395
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,599
right you're going to probably break

1396
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,040
some eggs

1397
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,960
and blow some people's houses over

1398
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,480
that's okay

1399
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,160
i'd rather be respected than liked

1400
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
typically i say work backwards start at

1401
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,520
things that are

1402
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
not everybody's tendency is to find all

1403
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,720
the legacy vulnerabilities have been

1404
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,319
there for 20 years and start trying to

1405
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,760
fix those first

1406
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,520
meanwhile you've got a pipeline where

1407
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,760
you're creating new ones and ones that

1408
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,200
just got that just came out of the

1409
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,640
pipeline

1410
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,160
so i would say

1411
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,400
find the ones that are in the pipeline

1412
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,760
right now because those actually have

1413
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,440
resources to do something

1414
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,200
then go to the ones that are just coming

1415
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,400
out of there that just came out of the

1416
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,000
pipeline because at least those are

1417
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,800
still fresh in somebody's mind and then

1418
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
go to look at the legacy stuff that was

1419
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
developed 25 years ago by people that

1420
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
are actually physically no longer with

1421
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,040
us

1422
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,640
finding a bunch of cobol-based

1423
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,559
vulnerabilities in an app

1424
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,000
that's super critical that a company is

1425
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,359
not going to win you friends because

1426
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,440
there's nobody to fix that

1427
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,000
they have all died

1428
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
i am not kidding anybody know cobalt

1429
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,839
here

1430
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,960
i learned it back in college like i know

1431
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,640
i know some fortran and cobol like i

1432
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
know the structure to write code no

1433
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,040
thanks

1434
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,880
there's a reason those jobs pay a half a

1435
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,359
million bucks a year right now

1436
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,640
there's like six people in the world

1437
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,880
alive that still know it

1438
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
stick with current issues and work back

1439
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,359
to legacy and then by all means a light

1440
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,359
some fires

1441
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,520
when things are important go light

1442
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,880
somebody's

1443
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,119
office on fire like let them know you

1444
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,839
are going to be the source of the breach

1445
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,760
i can show you why

1446
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,839
i have documented it it is going to be

1447
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,000
you they hold accountable because that's

1448
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,520
how we have to change the culture it

1449
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,760
can't just be us out there going hey i

1450
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,440
find a bunch of vulnerabilities go fix

1451
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,400
it go fix it and nobody cares

1452
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,720
vulnerability management is the central

1453
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,160
port of any

1454
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,839
uh any security operations in an

1455
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,280
organization

1456
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,720
that's where the security program is

1457
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,440
made or broken

1458
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,119
i can tell you everything i need to know

1459
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,960
about the rest of your security org by

1460
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,799
how well you manage vulnerabilities and

1461
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,079
how well that program runs

1462
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,319
we've got to do a better job it's got to

1463
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,920
start now because the alternative is to

1464
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,880
continue this damn train wreck

1465
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,200
that's why we have so many breaches we

1466
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,960
get people that go we didn't know that

1467
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,559
system existed and it hadn't been passed

1468
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,240
since 95.

1469
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,599
that is not an excuse i'm sorry

1470
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,119
one of our developers went out and you

1471
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,040
know hired or

1472
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,119
created 7 500 vms that security didn't

1473
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040
know about

1474
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,920
still your problem

1475
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,200
so that's all i got uh thanks for coming

1476
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,880
again if you guys listen to podcasts i

1477
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,960
would invite you go take a listen to

1478
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,720
down the security rabbit hole we're on

1479
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,880
we just hit 10 years

1480
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,000
we're starting to do some stuff with

1481
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,240
live linkedin live and live streams and

1482
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,119
stuff

1483
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,440
it's a lot of fun um

1484
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,319
breaking the 25 000 listener barrier so

1485
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,599
that's what you guys are hopefully going

1486
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,760
to help me do get over 25k

1487
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,200
and if you're on twitter i'm the white

1488
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,200
rabbit and that's it thanks for coming
