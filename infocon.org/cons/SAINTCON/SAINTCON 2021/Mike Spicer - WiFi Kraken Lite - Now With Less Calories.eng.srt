3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,680
day one

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,950

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
um i have been kind of slacking a little

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
bit on this whole pandemic thing but i

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
still made a little box for y'all to

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,480
check out today

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,439
so

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
welcome to my presentation uh today i'll

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
be talking about what's up here on the

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
stage after i talk you can come up and

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
ask me questions

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
or we might go out in the hallway i

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
don't know where i'm at in the lineup if

22
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
there's somebody after me we'll go to

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
the back and and talk about it but i'm

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,960
gonna give you the details of what's in

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
this little box here i know you're

26
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
probably like oh hey dude where's that

27
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,360
big

28
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
christmas tree looking thing and i'm

29
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,160
like

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
this is the future people this is the

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
future this is a wi-fi cracking light

32
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,800
yes now with less calories so let's jump

33
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
right into this so who am i uh i go by

34
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
dark matter on the internets

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
i'm a dad of two little hackers uh in

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
training so working my way with them

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
and then i've got uh

38
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
uh do a little bit of cyber security

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,040
research if you will

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
do some freelance also do some

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,920
development

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
if you didn't know this about me i'm a

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
little obsessed with the wireless i am

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,159
the creator of the wi-fi cactus the

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
wi-fi kraken the wi-fi crack in light

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
i do have a computer science degree from

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,880
southern utah university so go t-birds

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
uh i love to run i love to mountain bike

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
i love to snowboard i'm so looking

50
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,720
forward to the snowboard season and the

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
early snow so far let's hope it carries

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
on we could definitely use the moisture

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
uh and yeah like i said on twitter if

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,920
you want to follow me on the twitters um

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
sometimes i post useful things mostly

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
it's just random brain dumps

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
all right so what are you in for today

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,360
today

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
i've got for you

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
the wi-fi cracking light details so

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
we're going to break it all down we're

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
going to get into the nitty gritty but

63
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
first we're going to give you a little

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
history a history lesson on how i got

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
here kind of my mindset because at the

66
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
end of this i want every single one of

67
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
you to think

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
like you could build this yourself or

69
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
build something better because

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
heavens knows i'm not the best one at

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,959
this

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
and believe me we're gonna see some

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,000
pretty rad stuff through this talk

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
uh next we'll and then after that we'll

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
talk about the data's a little bit of

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
data as we do some live data demos i've

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
got the kraken hooked up via the magic

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
of usb 3.0

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
and we'll see if that all goes through

80
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
and see if we can do some live demos

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
another thing that i want to do this

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,440
year

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
that's really important to me is talking

84
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
about what the community is doing so i'm

85
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
going to show you some of the cool stuff

86
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
that the community is doing the war

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
driving community at large and hopefully

88
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
even inspire you more to get out go

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
sniff wirelesses and figure out what's

90
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,200
going on in the the wireless around you

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
and finally we'll talk a little bit

92
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
about what's the future what's next uh

93
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
as mike so eloquently pointed out i'm

94
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
missing leds on this so we already got

95
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
that one on the list gotta add leds

96
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
okay

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
so what is this thing the wi-fi cracking

98
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
light how do we get here a little bit of

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
a history lesson for you

100
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
so this is how it started for me um i

101
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
was going down to defcon i think it was

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
like 20 20 14

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
13 14 i don't know the past all blends

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,680
together at this point i don't know how

105
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
you guys are with with memory and stuff

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,799
but it's all blending together but

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
basically what happened is i had this

108
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,680
idea

109
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
people always said that the defcon

110
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
conference was the most dangerous crazy

111
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
wireless network in the world and i was

112
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,239
like

113
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
why do people say that like i believe

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,959
you but i don't

115
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,200
so i'm kind of a skeptic to begin with

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
so i was like i'm gonna build a tool to

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
be able to do this so this was just a

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
single board computer uh that had uh

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
some wireless radios attached to it um

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
threw some alphas into it hooked it up

121
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
to a battery put it in a box and threw

122
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,239
it in my backpack and started carrying

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
around also uh i did make this little

124
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
prototype wireless um

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
uh wrist mount so that i could control

126
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
it and get some information from it over

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
wi-fi so i was flooding myself with all

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
the signals

129
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
so then after that happened after i

130
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
created that box that box i started

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
talking to people about that project and

132
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
the data i actually did i think i did a

133
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
sync on talk that year i'm pretty sure i

134
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
did a sink on talk after i went to

135
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,440
defcon

136
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
about that little box project and then

137
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
uh that morphed into a bigger project um

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
through the help of uh conf and uh

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
warthog i was able to get uh sponsored

140
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
from intel and they were able to give me

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
a bunch of intel uh atom boxes single

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
board computers and i turned that into

143
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
12 remote nodes and so these are plugged

144
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
into the wall ac powered boxes uh each

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
of them had three radios in them they

146
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
had 802.11 and alpha radios plugged

147
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
those in throughout the conference and

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
then it was like getting fixed uh

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,360
wireless monitoring at the conference so

150
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
did some monitoring at black hat did

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,639
some monitoring uh at defcon also did

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,280
monitoring here at st con so if you want

153
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
you can go back and look at the youtubes

154
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
for the same cons and see some of my

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,080
past talks

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
about some of the fun wireless projects

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
over the years but this project i felt

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
was really successful i was able to get

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
a lot of data uh we were getting

160
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,400
distributed data but the nodes were in

161
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
fixed point places and so what that

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
meant is people as they were walking

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
past the nodes we were able to track

164
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
them as they moved like room to room and

165
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
area to area so it became like a really

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
neat uh example of what you could do

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
when you add monitoring in fixed node

168
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,960
location so like let's say for your

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
office you wanted to add bring your own

170
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
device policies you think somebody's

171
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
sneaking a cell phone in the front door

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
that's not allowed on your network it

173
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
all of a sudden shows up beaconing at

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
the front door and you watch it and it

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
sits down in the cubicle in your main

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
bullpen and next thing you know it's

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,919
like oh somebody's breaking the bringing

178
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,520
your own device policy and that's

179
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
something that we could essentially

180
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,440
demonstrate with this pro with this and

181
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
this is just all the off-the-shelf gear

182
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
so this is like only a few thousand

183
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,680
dollars we were able to implement this

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
all using open source wireless

185
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
hardware software and and

186
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
a few thousand dollars in hardware so uh

187
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
pretty cool stuff you can do

188
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
so that morphed into because i'm like oh

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
i got 12 well technically 36 radios but

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
they're all spread out and all the data

191
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
came back kind of fragmented it had

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,160
problems so i was actually at schmuck on

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
and i was talking to darren kitchen the

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
the founder of hack5 and i was like you

195
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
know would be really cool is if i could

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
just monitor everything at once

197
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
and he's like how many devices would you

198
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
need to do that and i'm like i don't

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,240
know

200
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,880
but i think like 25 or 30 would be

201
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
awesome uh radios

202
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
and next thing i know 25

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
uh a box of 25 hack five pineapples uh

204
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,440
showed up at my door

205
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
uh he shipped me 25 pineapple tetras so

206
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
each of those

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,120
had two wireless radios in them eight or

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
two 11n for a total of four antennas and

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,479
so this thing was a monster

210
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,319
it went through a few revisions i made

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
some changes to it um over the years i

212
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
increased the switches this is the

213
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
original the original design that had a

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,599
lead acid battery which was the dumbest

215
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
thing i ever did in one of my designs

216
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
but hey you can go to an auto parts

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,560
store and buy lead acid batteries you

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,639
can't go to the auto pod store and buy

219
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
lithium ion

220
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,360
but

221
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
and also i could buy five lead acid

222
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
batteries for what i paid for the

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
lithium ions in the upgrade um anyways

224
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,639
it's all just improvements over time

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,680
uh and so this solved the problem but it

226
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
was limited on run time but then i fixed

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
it but it was still limited on runtime

228
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
this thing weighed a little bunch it

229
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
wasn't super uh it wasn't super mobile

230
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
and also this thing i've taken all over

231
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
the world i've taken it to china i took

232
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
it to japan i took it to romania i took

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
it to the bahamas i took it to a bunch

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
of places and it was two carry-on cases

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
that i had to fly with to be able to get

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,840
this thing anywhere i went um which is

237
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,560
awesome and a feat and of itself but

238
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
after you do that for a few years you

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
start looking at options to make things

240
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
smaller

241
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,639
so i had this idea of okay well i'm

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,880
going to make a small case that has

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
stuff in it well small was kind of a

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
relative term

245
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,679
the screen in this display

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
is actually a 24-inch monitor so that

247
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
gives you an idea of how big this uh

248
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
it's a rip-off of pelican case how big

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
this pelican case was so it's 24-inch

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,240
for the monitor so it's pretty large and

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
it had a full-size pc motherboard in it

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,560
and i was using uh usb uh pci express to

253
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,519
uh seven usbs to pci express um ports

254
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,920
uh two of those to be able to hook up 14

255
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,959
usb adapters uh wireless adapters to

256
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
this computer so essentially this was a

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
computer in a box um a full-size atx

258
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
computer in a box with a monitor uh and

259
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,959
it ran off battery power i was pretty

260
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
happy i was able to get the whole system

261
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
like 12 volt bus and get everything

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,160
working i found a cool dc

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
at a dc power supply that did all the

264
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
adjustments to be able to hook it into

265
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
an atx motherboard

266
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
and it was a single checked bag the

267
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,959
problem is 25 pounds

268
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
when you're carrying it with your hand

269
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,839
is way worse than a back 35 pound

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,959
backpack

271
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,560
so this thing was a

272
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
pain to lug and the other thing too is

273
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
um there's just a lot of parts to this

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
uh and yeah also i i checked it so that

275
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
was cool i could check it as luggage and

276
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
um i wouldn't have to worry about it so

277
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
i didn't have to carry all the way

278
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,880
through the airports when i took it

279
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
places and this went to a number of

280
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
places internationally too

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
so this gave me an idea of okay how can

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
i make it smaller faster better

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
so my main goals for building in the

284
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,440
next project is more runtime more

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,720
wireless more power so the kraken it

286
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
only had the original kraken only had 14

287
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,519
total radios so

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
that was not like

289
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
my previous one had 50. so we went from

290
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,200
the wi-fi cactus which had 580211n

291
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,240
radios

292
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,120
this one the the cat the kraken had 14

293
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,240
80211ax radio or no ac radios excuse me

294
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
um and then i'm like okay i need more so

295
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
also along the journey that we've had we

296
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
also end up with new wi-fi standards too

297
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,760
because why why why do they want to keep

298
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
making new stuff well it's obviously we

299
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
want to go faster we're going to go

300
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
faster we're going to go better but that

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
also means that

302
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
you got to upgrade your projects right

303
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
so it's like built-in built-in

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
obsolescence so let's get down to the

305
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,399
nitty-gritty of what the crack and light

306
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,079
is

307
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
the kraken light

308
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
features an intel nook so this is my

309
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,959
second project using nooks i love nooks

310
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,120
um oh yeah this is a video

311
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,839
watch this let's see if it works yeah

312
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
we're getting interactive here uh so the

313
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
intel nook i really like the intel nook

314
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
it's a great form factor the nice thing

315
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
about the intel nook is

316
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
it has an nvme slot which exposes a pci

317
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
express 4x lane

318
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
it also has a hard drive controller for

319
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,959
a solid state hard drive

320
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,720
and then it also has a built-in wireless

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
it has built-in bluetooth she's got a

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,399
lot of really nice things into it into a

323
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
small form factor the other nice thing

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
too is that i can throw 32 gigs of ram

325
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
in there so a lot of the applications

326
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
that i use

327
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
uh take up a lot of ram they use a lot

328
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
of ram it's very important to have a lot

329
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
of ram um

330
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,959
oh yeah we can keep playing this it

331
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,240
doesn't loop automatically that's all

332
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
right let's keep playing uh and then the

333
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
other parts of this that are really cool

334
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
is i added an rtl sdr from new lec

335
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
um which is gonna be i'll talk about

336
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
what we're doing with that in a second

337
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,839
also found this really sick gps

338
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
transceiver if you're a gps receiver if

339
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
you're looking for the best gps receiver

340
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
it is this one uh it is a transystem gm

341
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,920
3n and it has 99 channels so that means

342
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,839
you're getting all of glonass you're

343
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,760
getting all the russia gps system you're

344
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
getting like basically ev anybody that's

345
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
doing gps and it's 10 hertz so it syncs

346
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
super fast

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,959
um and then also i've integrated a

348
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,440
14-inch laptop display which i don't

349
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
have hooked up right now because i'm

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,120
hijacking the hdmi but it's an ultra-low

351
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,399
power

352
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
laptop display so it came out of an hp

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
laptop i found a little cool converter

354
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
board on ebay there was like 18 bucks to

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
be able to take lvds which is what the

356
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
laptop outputs uh and turn it into hdmi

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
so i can have again because i love to

358
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,200
have the screen built into it it's like

359
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,399
it's like

360
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
a cyberpunk little laptop right like i

361
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
can literally put this on my lap i've

362
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,839
put it on my lap well i'm dry well not

363
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
while i'm driving but while i'm out

364
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,959
driving i'll pull up the side of the

365
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
road pull over the laptop and start

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
hacking on it

367
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
um and the other thing too is the

368
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
previous version of this the kraken

369
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
before the crack in light it wouldn't

370
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,959
even fit on the passenger seat in my wrx

371
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
like it wouldn't fit like to be able to

372
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,160
wardrive this fits nicely i can glance

373
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
over quickly and make sure i'm

374
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
collecting data everything's really nice

375
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
and then it has 20 amp hours of

376
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,440
lithium-ion battery because everything's

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
got to be battery powered uh that's the

378
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
most important thing oh and it's running

379
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
pen too so um anybody heard of pen 2

380
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,360
before

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
it's kind of like cali but it runs on

382
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
gen 2. uh it's maintained by um uh one

383
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
of the founders

384
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
of the uh the rf hat well the originally

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
called the wireless village at defcon uh

386
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,320
now called the rf sanctuary um

387
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
helps develop that and they've they've

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
got a big focus on wireless so there's a

389
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
lot of drivers and software that's

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
pre-built into pen too so if you're

391
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
looking to start with wireless projects

392
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,959
pentu's a awesome

393
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
distribution to get started with you're

394
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,320
going to find all of your same tools

395
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,760
you've got in cali there but you're

396
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
going to find a ton of pre-built in

397
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
radio stuff built in it as well

398
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
uh let's see

399
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,800
oh cool that started the video okay real

400
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,399
quick though i want to talk about some

401
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,040
of my lessons learned because

402
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,720
there were a lot going to this small box

403
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
there were a ton of lessons learned

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
one of the biggest things that i learned

405
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
is

406
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
we have a ton of different

407
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
drivers in linux kernels for pci express

408
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
so one thing i don't know if i mentioned

409
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
back on here let me highlight it there's

410
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,320
25 wireless radios in this box there's

411
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
24 on on carrier boards

412
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
uh and then there's another radio in the

413
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
nook itself and they're all on pci

414
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
express the way i'm able to do this is i

415
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
was able to break out from the pci

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
express slot in the nvme not the pci

417
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
express the nvme slot where you'd

418
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
normally put like a solid state hard

419
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
drive and then connected that and then

420
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
the second

421
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
way i got access to pci express is

422
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
through thunderbolt using thunderbolt 3

423
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,399
thunderbolt 3 exposes another 4x pcie so

424
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,839
i'm using two

425
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
directly to the cpu pci express slots at

426
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
4x each

427
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
so those are the limiting factors in the

428
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,959
bandwidth whereas the previous kraken it

429
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
was limited by

430
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,399
usb 3.0 this one is closer to the usb

431
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,199
bus

432
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
so in that process the bad things that

433
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
happened are

434
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
different linux kernels support pci

435
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
express differently depending on the

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,480
version and they're patching it

437
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
frequently they're making tons of

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,440
changes so what i found is on one of my

439
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
nooks i had a different nook a newer

440
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
nook it was actually an 11th gen intel i

441
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,759
ran into an issue where it would

442
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
allocate too much header space and it

443
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
would only then be able to give me

444
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,519
device

445
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
access to five devices even though i had

446
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,880
12 connected i could see 12 but in d

447
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
message it kept showing it would crash

448
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
so that's like a combination issue of

449
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,279
driver issues and intel only provides

450
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
the byte code for these intel wireless

451
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
adapters uh the binary driver basically

452
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
um and it was crashing and so i couldn't

453
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,399
do anything about it and it was also a

454
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
problem with the the linux headers uh

455
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
excuse me the linux kernel uh not

456
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
allocating enough memory space for these

457
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
drivers so it was like okay well who do

458
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
we point the finger at well intel are

459
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
you gonna fix your driver no because

460
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
it's an open source project and they

461
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,839
only provide binary so there's no source

462
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,360
nobody knows what's going on so it's

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
like okay well can we do anything in the

464
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
intel or in the linux kernel and it's

465
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
like kind of but most the people that

466
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,959
work on linux kernels aren't going to

467
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,000
listen to some guy that's trying to

468
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
build a wireless project with 25 radios

469
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,640
or 12 radios or yeah 25 radios because a

470
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,959
typical use case is max2 radios and it

471
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,199
works for that right it's like

472
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
no we're not building you some crazy

473
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,199
edge case

474
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
and then

475
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
you know we've got we've and the other

476
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
thing too is i ran into issues with

477
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
intermittency where radios would show up

478
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,679
on and off on and off i finally found a

479
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,319
stable configuration that i've got here

480
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,400
to be able to get everything to show up

481
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
now the ugly part like i said the newer

482
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,160
intel uh cpus and linux just are

483
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
terrible when you have tons of pci

484
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
express devices i don't know why i don't

485
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
know what's what's the problem is and

486
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
then the final thing that i learned is i

487
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
had this really cool it was a chinese uh

488
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
knock off nook

489
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
um that had two nvme slots

490
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
and which would be really neat to be

491
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,280
able to do that but it didn't have

492
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
thunderbolt it didn't have a bunch of

493
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,679
other things and sadly that device did

494
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
not work with this configuration so what

495
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
i found is 8th gen intel is the best

496
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
intel to be using with linux for pci

497
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
express if you want maximum

498
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
compatibility

499
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,480
real quick let's talk a little bit about

500
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
the software of what we've got going on

501
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,960
here so like i said i said we got pentu

502
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
uh shout out to zerochaos uh on on

503
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
twitter he's the one of the founders of

504
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,080
the rf uh sanctuary uh maintains that uh

505
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,240
super awesome go check it out give it a

506
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
try throw it in a virtual machine plug

507
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
in some radios and and watch how awesome

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,919
it can work for you

509
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
uh kismet

510
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
my all of my projects since their

511
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
inception well except for the very first

512
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
one i used aerodump

513
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
and didn't know what i was doing uh have

514
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,080
used kismet since then why because

515
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,360
kismet is the de facto just epic

516
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
software to use for wireless monitoring

517
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
it began as a war driving net stumbling

518
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,480
app for for wi-fi and it's really

519
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
matured into a full wireless monitoring

520
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
package you can add an sdr to it to be

521
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
able to start capturing um all sorts of

522
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
things in in kismet now uh including

523
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
like adsb like you can see you can watch

524
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
you can capture your airplanes flying

525
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
over your head with it now

526
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
as well as the wi-fi so uh huge shout

527
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
out to kismet um wireshark i love

528
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
wireshark uh

529
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
everything that i capture it goes to

530
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,679
pcapps pcaps or it didn't happen right

531
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
um and then

532
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
i wrote a tool called pcapinator uh

533
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,640
that's the github address if you want to

534
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
go and contribute to it i'm sure it's

535
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
not the best

536
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
uh written the best so i could always

537
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
use some help writing some tools on

538
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
there but basically the idea of it is if

539
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
anyone ever tried to run wireshark with

540
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
large files it's super pain it becomes

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
very tedious and hard and as you're

542
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,600
running it uh

543
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,240
this is slow and so what you do is you

544
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
run a bunch of tcp dumps all at the same

545
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
time as the solution that i found seems

546
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
to be the best one and that's what

547
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
pcapidator does is it's a multi-threaded

548
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
multi-processor supporting true uh

549
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
threading

550
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
application of running multiple tcp

551
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
dumps at the same time so that way it

552
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,840
speeds up

553
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
speeds up your ability to do

554
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,039
tcp or pcap analysis

555
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
and some new tools that i'm using this

556
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,919
year with this box is gqrx

557
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,760
gqrx is a software to be able to do

558
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
it just it's a generic

559
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
software-defined radio radio receiver so

560
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
what it does it allows us to have a

561
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
waterfall graph and i'll show you this

562
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
tool here in just a few and be able to

563
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
just kind of

564
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,559
shift through the bands and see what's

565
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
going on there and it has some built-in

566
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,799
decoders like there's fm decoder in it

567
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
so that way you could listen to uh

568
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,679
listen to the radio if you wanted to

569
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
with your 40

570
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
sdr

571
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,240
um and then uh the last tool that i use

572
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
is gnu radio this is really the army

573
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,520
swiss army knife of rtl sdr or radio

574
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,080
tools and it's basically you add block

575
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,159
diagrams you can create decoders you can

576
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,880
create just all sorts of things in there

577
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
and my interest in this is i've wanted

578
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
to use uh or i've wanted to learn more

579
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,600
information about lorawan lorawan is

580
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
something that's uh really interesting

581
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
to me so i've started doing some

582
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,799
monitoring with lorawan uh basically

583
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,320
lorowan it stands for a long range wide

584
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
area network uh is i think that's what

585
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
it is long range yeah and basically it

586
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,000
runs at 900 megahertz um and lorawan is

587
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
a technology that people are trying to

588
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
use for iot devices so and it gets up to

589
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,520
like 250 kilobits per second so it's low

590
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,600
bandwidth but iot devices and what

591
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
people are doing is they're taking their

592
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
their laura wang gateways and plugging

593
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,080
them into their home networks or

594
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,679
plugging them into the their corporate

595
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,640
networks and so my hypothesis that i'm

596
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,080
testing is that there might be ways to

597
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
access these networks over laurel and

598
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
connections because they may be coming

599
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
trusted because they're hooking their

600
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
iot devices so

601
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,320
all right a little bit of disclaimer uh

602
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
some of the data from this year is going

603
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,600
to be a little bit

604
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
less than in previous years uh the goal

605
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
of my my projects recently have been

606
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
trying to find more specific pieces of

607
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
information and not necessarily broad

608
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
capture like i have in the past i used

609
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,679
to measure like in hundreds of gigabytes

610
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,960
how much data

611
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,039
i would i would try to capture and this

612
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,280
year not so much so let's bring the

613
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
expectations down just a little bit uh

614
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
and also i didn't go a whole lot of

615
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,440
places

616
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,559
so

617
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,520
basically i caught data in about two

618
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
places so around utah and got about 20

619
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,960
gigs with this thing and down in vegas

620
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,679
about 100 gigs and all those other

621
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,520
places i didn't get to go to theirs

622
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,960
thanks kovid

623
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
screw you

624
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
hopefully here soon though hopefully we

625
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,880
got lots of plans those are all places i

626
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,559
was supposed to go over the last year

627
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,400
and a half anyways

628
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,039
uh in the data set uh one thing that i

629
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,960
thought was interesting is

630
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
uh there was about 88

631
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
that's encrypted now what's fun about

632
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
that 88

633
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,760
is

634
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,120
probably 50 of it about half of it uh

635
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
was at black cat and if anyone's ever

636
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
been to black ad before you know that

637
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
black hat plus the year is the wi-fi

638
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,919
password that everybody shares

639
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,000
so in theory

640
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,600
50 of that is no longer encrypted uh we

641
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
just got to go decode that so yeah we'll

642
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
we'll look at that later we'll look at

643
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,120
that a little bit uh and then i found 11

644
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
unencrypted and there wasn't really much

645
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
that was interesting in the unencrypted

646
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
mostly it just is management frames and

647
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,279
uh

648
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,960
dns because

649
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,760
why not why why do we keep using dns in

650
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
the cli especially multicast dns

651
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
i don't why is multicast like yeah i get

652
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,360
it it's easy to do airdrop and stuff but

653
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,880
i don't know jim's iphone that's

654
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
important for everyone to broadcast uh

655
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,360
some stuff that i saw uh in the wild at

656
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,120
um def con that i thought was

657
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,159
interesting some dios in the wild

658
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,720
there was only six i only caught six mac

659
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
granted i only captured data for

660
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
probably about like four hours five

661
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,559
hours

662
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,240
compared to years past where i'd be

663
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
running my equipment 24 7 and trying to

664
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,760
soak up as much

665
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
attacks and things as i could but it was

666
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
about 239 000 packets of deoths that i

667
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,640
saw coming from six unique mac addresses

668
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
evil twin attacks they were launching

669
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,039
about 33 000 uh probe requests or

670
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,679
probe responses and that was coming from

671
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
about 42 mac addresses and there was

672
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
probably about 10 or 15 of those that

673
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
they still had their default

674
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
wi-fi pineapple mac address i don't know

675
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,080
people just love using the zero zero

676
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
one three three seven mac address for

677
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
some reason uh and broadpone uh this is

678
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
a callback to a talk from a few years

679
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,240
ago

680
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,840
broadpone was supposed to be the most

681
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,159
devastating uh

682
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,919
vulnerability that ever existed

683
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,320
expecting 20 million devices still zero

684
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,200
still zero seen it zero times haven't

685
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,360
seen any real effects of that

686
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,840
devastating attack so

687
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,039
go

688
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,279
things with uh webs go with yeah

689
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,600
vulnerabilities or

690
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,120
what is it called the

691
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,799
things that have websites

692
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,640
all right so

693
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,760
let's do

694
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,279
let's switch over now we're going to go

695
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,720
ahead and do some live we're doing it

696
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,039
live

697
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,919
maybe

698
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,080
yeah there we go okay so one of the

699
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,679
really cool things about kismet so i

700
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,000
wanted to show you so i went and

701
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
captured data

702
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,919
from defcon

703
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,000
and so this that's the list here is some

704
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
of the data's from defcons you'll see

705
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
some of the dates and also some of it

706
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
war driving preparing for defcon

707
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
so um i'm just going to go ahead and

708
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
load one of these files back into kismet

709
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
and it'll be like we're going back to

710
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,919
vegas so i'm bringing you to vegas with

711
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,799
me so what we can do is if we just write

712
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,159
kismet

713
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,720
kissmet

714
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
it's hard to type dash c

715
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
and then we're going to grab one of

716
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
these files

717
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
let's see where is one that's decent but

718
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
not too big

719
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
08

720
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
wait that wasn't right

721
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
how about we just copy and paste that

722
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
will be i'm sure that's a winning

723
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
strategy whoever came up with copy and

724
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,879
paste was a genius

725
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,159
and we'll go ahead and paste this in and

726
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
what's going to happen is it's going to

727
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
load that data source that kismet data

728
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,559
source so

729
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,720
kismet stores information these dot

730
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
kizmet files one thing that's really

731
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
cool about the dot kizmet files

732
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,000
you'll see here there's all the mac

733
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
addresses being reloaded in the system

734
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,919
being replayed there's also a flag to

735
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,240
replay it in real time so we could see

736
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,320
it as it was going out so let's say you

737
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
go on an engagement and i've actually

738
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
done this gone on engagement gone

739
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
walking around war-drived around the

740
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,679
engagement and then i wanted to go back

741
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,120
because i'm like oh i don't remember

742
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,760
where or when i caught this you replay

743
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,840
your entire capture that you did and let

744
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,320
it go in real time but right now it's

745
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,799
just loading this as fast as it possibly

746
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
can

747
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,480
let's see here so as this is loading

748
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,360
we'll get it all loaded

749
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
there i need to move this

750
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,399
so i can see better

751
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,000
to do this

752
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
there we go

753
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,799
local host so if you have kids met uh

754
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
fire up your kismet client and then pull

755
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,440
up your local host so right now right

756
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,399
here it looks like the black hat arsenal

757
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,080
which i don't know if any of you set up

758
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,240
a black cat arsenal

759
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
around here uh

760
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
maybe this is somebody's access point

761
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
but if you look it's actually from

762
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,559
august 5th so this is from black hat uh

763
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
and so just like that we're able to now

764
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,960
see data from the past from what we're

765
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
looking at and we can start doing some

766
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
analysis so what do we know about this

767
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
they're using ruckus wireless checks out

768
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
yeah that's what they use down there at

769
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,720
black hat we can see the channel we can

770
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,559
see what type of data and management

771
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,039
frames were set the llc management

772
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,600
frames we can see how many there was we

773
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
can also look at

774
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,919
different wireless clients that were

775
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
connected to this and we can also look

776
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,039
at related ssids as well so just like

777
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
that quick reloading the data we can go

778
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,440
back and do post analysis so this is

779
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320
super handy super useful so we can also

780
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,919
see that we had clients associated so

781
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,279
let's just jump over and look at a

782
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
client really quick uh and see what we

783
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
can figure out about that we can see

784
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,960
that it's an intel device based off of

785
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
the mac address

786
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
we can see that they were on 5.5

787
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
gigahertz and it's maybe possible that

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
we may have seen that person pro make

789
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,000
some pro requests this one didn't catch

790
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
any probe requests

791
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,279
but that could like let's say there was

792
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,600
a situation where somebody was hiding

793
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
their ssid

794
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,120
if we waited long enough i bet we could

795
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
figure out what that ssid is because at

796
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
some point there's going to be a probe

797
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,360
request for it so hidden networks are

798
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,158
not secure

799
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
and we can see that it was a client

800
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,000
behavior of this if there were more

801
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
client like if it's switched excuse me

802
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,880
between different access points uh we

803
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
could see all the access points that it

804
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,399
switched to so this was just a random

805
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,039
one i've just pulled up quickly

806
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,440
so that that way i could show you so

807
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,520
that should give you an idea of like how

808
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
crazy powerful

809
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,279
uh kismet is

810
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
just that quick we can load it we can

811
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,919
bring it up

812
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
but i know why you all are really here

813
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,600
somebody out there is thinking this guy

814
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,720
doesn't really have 25 radios in here

815
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,159
does he

816
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,880
it's like all right well let's do the

817
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
the iw config

818
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,799
oh please be there i just i didn't even

819
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,960
look beforehand

820
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
just kidding

821
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
i think

822
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
oh i know why i'm doing oh it's yeah it

823
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,679
is there we go

824
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,880
i was using the wrong command

825
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,320
can't type typing is hard

826
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
there we go

827
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,159
okay who wants to count them anybody

828
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,440
want to count them raise your hand you

829
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,880
want to count them so we've got all

830
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
these wireless devices so

831
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
let's do something with them shall we

832
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,960
we've already got kismet running

833
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,640
let's go ahead and close it but we need

834
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
to launch it with all of our other

835
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
devices kismet c and wlan so we're going

836
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,159
to go ahead and launch

837
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,840
so we can start doing some stuff live

838
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,679
got to take advantage of all of those

839
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,919
wireless radios so

840
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,840
one thing that's really cool too okay so

841
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,600
one of the problems that this device

842
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,919
fixed from the wireless kraken so with

843
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,240
the original wireless kraken

844
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,399
um

845
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,159
it was over usb and one of the problems

846
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,200
with usb is devices on the usb bus

847
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
apparently block each other in linux

848
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,279
when they're communicating with each

849
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,880
other so

850
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
when i had 14 devices on the usb bus and

851
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,519
i would want to request changes hardware

852
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,120
changes it would block each other and

853
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,880
lock up the software and there was huge

854
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,960
issues and one of the things that i

855
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
would love to have done in the other

856
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,399
kraken is come in here and i can look at

857
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,559
the data source so i'm looking at wlan 0

858
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,919
right now and i can lock it so let's say

859
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,240
um i'm doing reconnaissance i'm looking

860
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
over all the wireless that's in use and

861
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,720
i found that there's one access point

862
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
that i want to target because i know

863
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
that this

864
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
channel and this access point is the one

865
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,880
that's going to get me my pay dirt so

866
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
i'm going to come over here i'm going to

867
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
hit lock and i'm going to lock it to

868
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
channel 6 because i know that i'm going

869
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
to see a connection so now i'm going to

870
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,919
de-off that person with my wi-fi

871
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,000
pineapple or my other device

872
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,240
uh d-off that person watch them

873
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
disconnect and then reconnect

874
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
and as that happens i'm monitoring on

875
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,080
the channel i'm watching that whole

876
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,320
connection process this can be helpful

877
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,000
when you're trying to do like meep

878
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,960
hammer

879
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,360
where you're trying to do uh like crack

880
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,320
uh

881
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
ms chap connections uh basically wpa2

882
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,399
enterprise uh wireless connections and

883
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
you're capturing all this data directly

884
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,000
in kismet

885
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,360
um

886
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,600
for later analysis and also for then

887
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
breaking so i just saw something rad pop

888
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,039
up so one thing that's neat in kismet 2

889
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,039
we have this saintcon wireless network

890
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,679
and it just showed up in red and as soon

891
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,000
as we get that red something awesome

892
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,159
just happened and what happened is

893
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,159
that means we just caught the handshake

894
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,679
so somebody just connected to the

895
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,440
saintcon wireless network and we were

896
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,039
able to capture their handshake

897
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,720
so and one thing that kismet enables

898
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
is one click download of the pcap file

899
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,679
for the key exchange so just like that

900
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,880
i have

901
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
the whole key exchange that happened

902
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
thanks to someone connecting to there so

903
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,720
i could go take this down yeah yeah

904
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,240
shout out to dragon for adding that

905
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
that's freaking dope

906
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
so i can now take this downstairs to

907
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,720
metacortex down in the gpu cracking the

908
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
the password cracking village take him

909
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
this pcap file and he can start cracking

910
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,480
it instantly

911
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
so

912
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
i didn't even intend on showing that

913
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
part of it in in my demo here ryan i

914
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,840
just kind of fell together so

915
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,480
yay shout out to uh that

916
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,039
let's see i thought i clicked to open in

917
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
wireshark let's see if it actually opens

918
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
oh well okay

919
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,960
so let's see what's next

920
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
uh

921
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,559
let's see

922
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,919
we showed that okay yeah let's talk

923
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,360
about um

924
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
i'm not gonna get gps indoors uh but i

925
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,720
can i think i can show you

926
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
uh the gps cat

927
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,480
and just show you or let's see gps mon

928
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,599
and

929
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,599
oh nope it's not something's messed up

930
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
with it anyways can't show you the gps

931
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
probably because we don't have a fix

932
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,040
inside but it is really fast so

933
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
find me later we'll do the gps but let's

934
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,359
check out gqrx

935
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
gqrx is a really fun tool

936
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
if you're just starting into wireless i

937
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,520
would highly suggest just go download

938
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,440
gqrx get a wireless an rtl sdr plug it

939
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,918
in and start just figuring out what's in

940
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,280
the airwaves around you so i'm going to

941
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
push the play button

942
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,719
which should start this recording so

943
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,480
right now i'm looking in the 433

944
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,719
megahertz spectrum so this is just

945
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
creating a waterfall so we're seeing a

946
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,800
couple of spikes basically what this is

947
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
just showing us is signal and this sdr

948
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
this particular one only has 2.5

949
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,320
megahertz of bandwidth which means we

950
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,359
can only see 2.5 megahertz of spectrum

951
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,800
at the same time

952
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
and right now we're looking at between

953
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,160
432

954
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,119
megahertz and

955
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,839
434 with our center channel i'm 433 and

956
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,440
the reason why i'm looking at 433

957
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,839
because that's where iot devices live so

958
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,839
had i had an iot or somebody here

959
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,440
there's actually something there's

960
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
there's this little weirdness that's

961
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
happening this little peak area here

962
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,079
between 433 it's like centered right on

963
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,640
433 and a little bit above this might be

964
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
something that's communicating so now

965
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,400
what i would do is i would go into the

966
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
other software

967
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,640
gnu radio companion

968
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,440
and then i would do let's see where is

969
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,680
that

970
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,920
let's see where are you pentu radio

971
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,960
and gnu radio companion so then i would

972
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,520
come into radio com gnu radio companion

973
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,920
and here i'm sorry it's so small i don't

974
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
know if i can make it bigger

975
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,560
um one of the fun things about open

976
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
source is they always accessibility is

977
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
the next stage

978
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
you get it functional first and then

979
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,480
they go in and add the things to zoom

980
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,200
and i'm still a noob at this so then

981
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
what i would do is i'd come in here and

982
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
then tune my channels uh this is

983
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
basically a block diagram that's looking

984
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,599
at uh the taking the the data from the

985
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
rtl sdr and then it's decoding it using

986
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,240
a lora receiver so somebody has been

987
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,480
generous enough to write an open source

988
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,839
receiver that will decode laura so um

989
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,000
and i need to stop this one really quick

990
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,480
and then i can launch this one let's see

991
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
if it compiles

992
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,079
i checked it yesterday and we should be

993
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,079
good

994
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
uh

995
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,680
maybe not

996
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,560
well

997
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
that's what happens sometimes i don't

998
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,680
know why that one's running but

999
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,119
basically what it's going to do is it's

1000
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,000
going to actually take this signal uh

1001
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,920
and then process it and try to decode it

1002
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
and see if it would be something um so

1003
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,760
i'm not familiar i'm not sure if there

1004
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,160
are actually any devices here in the in

1005
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,040
the

1006
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
in the area that are lorawan or lora

1007
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,079
devices

1008
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,760
so um

1009
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,240
yeah so basically this is

1010
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,599
this is something that i'm working on

1011
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,280
this is something new to me

1012
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
i'm trying to get further and further

1013
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,560
down into the radio

1014
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,920
uh the

1015
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,720
the radio spectrum and and so the next

1016
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,880
place to be is right here in waterfalls

1017
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,200
and then decoding these things so look

1018
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,040
for more of this from me in the future

1019
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
this is me getting my feet wet and this

1020
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,640
is something that you can do like

1021
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,400
relatively cheaply like you can even

1022
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,440
find rtl sdrs for as cheap as 18

1023
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
i believe they've got some downstairs in

1024
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,000
the

1025
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
in one of the villages i'm sure i know

1026
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,680
in years past i've seen them you can

1027
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,960
just plug them in start playing with

1028
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
them start you know tuning different

1029
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,400
frequencies and start seeing what's

1030
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,079
happening in the in the wireless around

1031
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,480
you and that's the way that these that's

1032
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
the way you know these type of boxes

1033
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
happen that's the way you know these

1034
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,480
projects happen is you know get curious

1035
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,800
get out there get doing stuff

1036
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,440
uh let's see you talked about those so

1037
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,280
now the next part that i really wanted

1038
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
to talk about that i'm super happy to

1039
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,160
talk about

1040
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
is the community so as i started this

1041
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
project i would thought

1042
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,480
not this project but all the projects

1043
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
all the years that i've been doing this

1044
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,079
i thought i was alone in wanting to know

1045
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,839
this and then it turns out you know

1046
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,440
there's people like you that want to

1047
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,160
find out more that want to know this too

1048
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,800
and so i found a bunch of like-minded

1049
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
individuals i had people come to my

1050
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
talks and

1051
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,079
then i've met more people at different

1052
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,359
conferences

1053
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,079
and it seems that there's like

1054
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
just a genuine interest in understanding

1055
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,960
and demystifying the black magic that is

1056
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,440
wireless and so what i wanted to do in

1057
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,160
this talk today because i i have been

1058
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,800
blown away with what i've seen

1059
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,560
all of y'all working on

1060
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
it's i wanted to share some of the cool

1061
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,320
projects that people have shared with me

1062
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
i've seen a number of these in person

1063
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
but some of them it was the first time i

1064
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,079
saw them online and i want what i want

1065
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,760
to do is i want i hope that this

1066
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,560
inspires you to go build a war driving

1067
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,560
box build a rig grab a raspberry pi

1068
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,720
make it collect wireless

1069
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,200
stuff even if it's like just probes if

1070
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
even if it's just like basic stuff go

1071
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,119
try it because that's the type of things

1072
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,680
that you're going to learn about and

1073
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
it's going to help you really understand

1074
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
what's happening in the area around you

1075
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,720
so

1076
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,680
amelie fox has created this wireless

1077
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,800
device

1078
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
uh this one's really cool looking i have

1079
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,800
no idea about what the specs are or

1080
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
what's going on on this all i can do is

1081
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,520
based on visualization so up here in the

1082
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,240
top there's a really cool keyboard i

1083
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
actually have this little keyboard they

1084
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,960
are such a pain to type in but if you

1085
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,599
used to use the old um oh what was those

1086
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
the the sidekicks the the t-mobile

1087
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,079
sidekick like these are perfect for you

1088
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,839
this is exactly what you want and it has

1089
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,000
a little touchpad and arrow keys and

1090
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
everything uh and then display built-in

1091
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,319
display it looks like there's a power

1092
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,960
supply down here and then they've got

1093
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
pigtails running off to their wireless

1094
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,359
antennas so the antennas are coming out

1095
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,119
of the box and they're using the same

1096
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,599
box that i am the apache so

1097
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,079
if you want a cheap entry option to

1098
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,880
start building boxes like really rugged

1099
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,680
boxes harbor freight for the win uh

1100
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,520
these things are solid i think they sell

1101
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
them as gun boxes uh but

1102
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
i've been a big fan of these apache

1103
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,240
boxes this i think they're like about 20

1104
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,560
28 bucks i think for this size

1105
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,359
uh so and you can see here amelie fox

1106
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,880
has done this one this one blows me away

1107
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,839
so i got to see this one in person at uh

1108
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,480
defcon this is from arimond 2001.

1109
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,680
and this is just a monster of a box like

1110
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,520
all of these antennas up here that's

1111
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,839
just and then the cable management like

1112
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,000
that's something i really like need to

1113
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
improve on is like my cable management

1114
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,240
and my layout but they're running all

1115
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
usb in here this is all usb and it's

1116
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,119
going to four raspberry pi's

1117
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,920
so it's it's quite an interesting take

1118
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,400
on it i never thought of using uh

1119
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
multiple concurrent raspberry pi's but

1120
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,160
essentially that's what my cactus

1121
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,400
project did is it took all the cat all

1122
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,480
the all the individual pineapple tetras

1123
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
and fed all that data back to a to uh

1124
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,680
intel nook as the remote node here

1125
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,640
they're doing the individual um

1126
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,240
the individual uh usb wireless adapters

1127
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,000
and then they're syncing all that data

1128
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,800
back uh when like offloading it from the

1129
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,319
unit but they're capturing on four

1130
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,240
different devices at the same time and

1131
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
uh funny uh strapped it in for the

1132
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,760
wardrive gotta make sure you got the

1133
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,839
seat belt on your on your on your

1134
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,760
equipment in the back there

1135
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,240
uh this is this is a rad one so the one

1136
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,640
on the left over here uh basically what

1137
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,240
you have is a simple phone like a

1138
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,200
tablet android device that appears to be

1139
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,240
running successfully kismet

1140
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,839
and then they've got the wireless

1141
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
adapter over usb connected to the usb

1142
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,480
hub and then like the cute keyboard to

1143
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,280
go with it this is by far the smallest

1144
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
well

1145
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,000
second smallest

1146
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
um

1147
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
kismet setup that i've seen for

1148
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,119
wardriving so this is this is a usb

1149
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,680
device plugged into a phone really cool

1150
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,000
and then on top of that on the right

1151
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,319
uh is drone so that's one thing i want

1152
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,480
to do for the future is add more

1153
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,319
wireless monitoring capabilities to

1154
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,960
drones i keep finding all these gated

1155
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,720
communities and i just

1156
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,480
i just get bored waiting for someone to

1157
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,000
drive in and out of the gate to follow

1158
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
them in no just kidding i don't do that

1159
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,240
that was a joke um so i'll just use a

1160
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
drone and fly over their house then

1161
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,200
collect all the wi-fi that way

1162
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,599
uh this one's from dustin finn another

1163
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,400
uh apache uh the apache mod or the

1164
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,560
apache uh case

1165
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,520
um

1166
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,839
and uh as you can see here they've got

1167
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,720
the

1168
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,040
uh the the the bunch of wireless

1169
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,920
adapters these are all uh 802.11 ac

1170
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,040
wireless adapters um these are this is a

1171
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,640
really cool setup and then the antenna

1172
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,880
is coming out of the box uh for me

1173
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
personally i like to keep my stuff a

1174
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,040
little more concealed well

1175
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,800
in previous years i haven't but this one

1176
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,880
i wanted to be a more discreet uh a

1177
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
little more uh self

1178
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,400
uh contained

1179
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
and then here's another one from j

1180
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,319
hewitt net this one this one i think

1181
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,319
takes the cake for smallest this one's

1182
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,440
using two esp32 devices uh to record

1183
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,599
data onto i believe sd cards and then

1184
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,599
has wireless adapters coming out of it

1185
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,440
so this one you wouldn't be able to do

1186
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
full frame this one's probably just a

1187
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
wiggle device how many people have heard

1188
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,599
of wiggle before so wiggle is a war

1189
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,240
driving software that runs on android i

1190
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,920
would encourage everyone to go to their

1191
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,599
app store right now and well if you're

1192
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,680
on android you have to be on android go

1193
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,920
search wiggle and join and start war

1194
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
driving right now you can start grabbing

1195
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,280
pro requests so this would be a war

1196
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,599
driving rig for that purpose

1197
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,359
and then there's the the master full

1198
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,920
lausanni

1199
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,960
has created this case and anyone that uh

1200
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,359
flies frequently might recognize the

1201
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,400
center pitcher he's got this set up in a

1202
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,200
uh or they've got this set up in a delta

1203
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,599
sky uh delta sky club so

1204
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,920
that's pretty rad and then

1205
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
their new project over on the right is

1206
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,520
amazing it's gonna be a watch a watch

1207
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,960
monitoring device so there is the

1208
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,119
absolute smallest so this stuff's really

1209
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,440
inspirational people are doing just

1210
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
insane stuff with their wireless

1211
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
monitoring projects and i mean we've got

1212
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,760
just so cool tech uh and then shout out

1213
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,800
to monkey dragon um i do a podcast and

1214
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,599
we just had a talk with him uh last week

1215
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
on the podcast and uh this is his rig

1216
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,079
it's got a uh external wireless antenna

1217
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,760
i envision that this system is going to

1218
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,920
be actually integrated and mounted into

1219
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,079
his car before too long um time how much

1220
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,520
time

1221
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,839
that was time

1222
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
15 minutes roger roger okay uh and then

1223
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,599
there's mr bill uh another oh there's

1224
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,119
this group called the hard hat brigade

1225
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,440
they take hard hats and modify them into

1226
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,760
wireless monitoring devices and then add

1227
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,520
some flair to it uh mr bill is the

1228
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,680
originator of the hard hat brigade uh

1229
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,160
but this is his war cycling rig so he

1230
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,640
takes this bike around where he lives in

1231
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,839
a populist city on the west coast and uh

1232
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,920
yeah that's all it is it's just throw

1233
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
some throw some hardware in the back of

1234
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,000
a bike throw a gps on it and boom away

1235
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,720
you go um

1236
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,319
and then we've got

1237
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,340
daley

1238
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,119
[Music]

1239
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,280
aka ryan

1240
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,839
uh and they've taken a clean approach

1241
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,560
they've got uh a very nice output

1242
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,040
display you know they've got the the two

1243
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,280
uh display the two um line um

1244
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,560
what are those called

1245
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,480
displays i don't know

1246
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,000
basically you can get them on adafruit

1247
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,480
for like 18 bucks or 20 bucks and then

1248
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
connected that into another system

1249
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
they've got batteries and they've got

1250
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
the antennas out but then also the

1251
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,520
antennas are external so it looks like

1252
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,920
it's hooked onto their car so this is

1253
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
definitely a war driving rig so really

1254
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,920
cool stuff uh then we've got the vioxx

1255
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,240
uh and what we've got over here again

1256
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
another box you're starting to see a see

1257
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,240
a theme here right you see the radios

1258
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,560
thrown in a box you've got batteries

1259
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,800
you've got your antennas and then you've

1260
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
got the duck of course you always have

1261
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
to have a duck and then this also is a

1262
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
war driving rig how do i know because

1263
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,520
there's the cigarette usb or uh not usb

1264
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,079
the 12 volt cigarette lighter

1265
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,560
so it looks like conversion system built

1266
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
into there so that they can pull the the

1267
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,640
power out of there and then finally this

1268
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,480
is one of the most professional looking

1269
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,800
rigs that i've seen so this one is using

1270
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,160
these boards from

1271
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,880
alftel a guy out of

1272
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,119
canada that's making these custom boards

1273
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,880
that have wireless radios built into

1274
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
them and then bunching them all together

1275
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
so this is a complete board he sells

1276
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,200
them on tindy you can go check him out

1277
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,599
look at alftel on tindy that's actually

1278
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,280
where i got my carrier boards to be able

1279
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,760
to hook up so many pci express devices

1280
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
and then on top of that there's custom

1281
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,240
antenna arrays and these are actually

1282
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,720
properly spaced so i just have an

1283
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
antenna block that i had my friend

1284
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,800
weston uh put together in 3d print for

1285
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,880
me and i just shoved antennas in it if i

1286
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,680
was an actual radio guy

1287
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,280
then i would probably make something

1288
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,359
that looked like this that has proper

1289
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,760
spacing and antennas look really clean

1290
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,160
uh that's really cool i love this i love

1291
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,280
this design

1292
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
so uh we're getting kind of short on

1293
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,200
time here so let's talk about what's the

1294
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
future is so

1295
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,640
this is what i want for the future i

1296
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,800
want to be cosplaying as the guy on the

1297
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
right there i got my antennas in back

1298
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,640
you know

1299
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,240
doing some rage

1300
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,440
radio direction finding stuff i got my

1301
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,480
yogi gun bfg 9000

1302
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,640
yeah i'm gonna cosplay as this see you

1303
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,319
know this is this is this is where i'm

1304
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,760
this is where i'm going obviously you

1305
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,720
got the bodyguard uh yeah at a minimum

1306
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,640
i'm cosplaying as this next year at

1307
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,559
defcon

1308
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,480
all right and with that let's uh let's

1309
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,240
open it up for some questions

1310
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,599
uh

1311
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,720
tsa has been extremely easy they just

1312
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,800
keep putting these little slips that say

1313
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,920
your stuff has been uh inspected

1314
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,079
uh so i haven't had any problems the

1315
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,720
people that do freak out is the customs

1316
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,359
people coming back to the united states

1317
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,359
uh they think that i like especially

1318
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,040
when i came back from the bahamas they

1319
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,119
thought maybe i had met with someone

1320
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,760
offshore and am smuggling this back in

1321
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,160
and trying to get into like uh some sort

1322
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,119
of

1323
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,720
i don't know government installation

1324
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,119
with it i had to do a second round of

1325
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,200
screening and go through it and open it

1326
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
up and explain it was for research and

1327
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,440
then i had showed them some articles

1328
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,760
that were written about my projects and

1329
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,440
but that was the only problem i've ever

1330
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,599
had i even even going into china i

1331
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,599
thought going into china would have been

1332
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,119
problematic but uh it was not it was not

1333
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,800
it was coming back to america that was

1334
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,319
the problem

1335
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,440
any other questions yeah

1336
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
the the do with the gathered data

1337
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,920
uh the question is what do i do with the

1338
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,559
gathered data so right now i've mostly

1339
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,200
been like i do analysis and then do

1340
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,800
interesting analysis and then try to

1341
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
include it in talks and then try to give

1342
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,520
examples of like this is bad

1343
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,200
network

1344
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,119
setups this is problems this is why you

1345
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,960
should use encryption this is why

1346
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,119
everyone shouldn't use the same password

1347
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,800
this is why you should use a vpn if

1348
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
you're on an open hotspot so use that

1349
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,640
for that type of stuff also show some

1350
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,200
interesting statistics but this year

1351
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,839
thanks to this uh company that got

1352
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,720
breached uh what was their names

1353
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,040
i don't remember but they were a dns or

1354
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
a hosting company they got breached that

1355
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,800
also as a vpn provider uh they uh leaked

1356
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,240
a bunch of vpn keys so now i'm gonna go

1357
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,760
back and look through my data and see if

1358
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,760
i've ever captured any of their vpn data

1359
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,839
because now i can decrypt that based off

1360
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,079
of the leaked keys so

1361
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,920
data hoarding for the win so i'm a

1362
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,240
little bit of a data hoarder so yeah i'm

1363
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,680
going to look to see if there's any sort

1364
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,599
of correlations because at this point

1365
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,440
i've got almost five terabytes of data

1366
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,599
i've captured over the years so

1367
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,599
it's not a ton of data when you consider

1368
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,280
like a network tap or something like

1369
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,480
that that's capturing everything

1370
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,800
directly on a wire connected to it but

1371
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,880
for just some random guy passively

1372
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,359
sniffing stuff at conferences that's

1373
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,359
quite a bit so

1374
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,160
other questions yes

1375
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,680
a great question and i totally should

1376
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,119
have addressed this didn't even think

1377
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,400
about it thank you for bringing that up

1378
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
the question is why is there so many

1379
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
radios the point of having so many

1380
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,319
radios is if you have just one radio and

1381
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,760
you're trying to listen on the channels

1382
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,200
right now with 802.11 ax or wi-fi 6

1383
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,640
there is about

1384
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,920
93 94 total channels including 40

1385
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,319
megahertz and 80 megahertz wide channels

1386
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,680
and 160 megahertz channels uh widths and

1387
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,720
so what's going to happen is you're

1388
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
going to be jumping across every one of

1389
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,079
those channels and as you're jumping

1390
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,839
across it you miss the conversation

1391
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,240
that's happening granted with the 20

1392
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,200
megahertz channels in the 2.4 gigahertz

1393
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,599
there's really only three channels 1 6

1394
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,440
and 11 that really matter because those

1395
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,119
are the center channels and they're 20

1396
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,599
wide but there's always the people that

1397
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,119
set them to non-standard channels so

1398
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,319
you're going to start missing that

1399
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,640
information so the point is to add a

1400
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,680
bunch of

1401
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,119
devices

1402
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,800
so that way i can listen to all of those

1403
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
conversations at the same time also too

1404
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,920
if you have a network situation where

1405
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
you have transient devices devices

1406
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,280
moving between access points people

1407
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,800
roaming you'll be able to see those

1408
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,400
whole conversations as they happen

1409
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,000
because you have more devices to capture

1410
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,960
that information so it ultimately came

1411
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,599
out of a need or of me determining that

1412
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,839
i had a bunch of fragmented packets and

1413
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,400
i wanted more so and then i just took it

1414
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,480
to an extreme with the cactus having 50

1415
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,440
radios this one has 25 but also is

1416
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,359
significantly smaller and easier to

1417
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,640
carry so

1418
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,640
yes

1419
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
so the question i think is am i

1420
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,079
pre-configuring each of the radios or is

1421
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,760
it hopping how is that how does that

1422
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
process work is that the general gist of

1423
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,160
your question

1424
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,760
so uh in the kismet software uh in the

1425
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,520
kidsmet software it actually has the

1426
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,440
ability to take advantage of multiple

1427
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,119
radios and it will automatically stagger

1428
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,599
those for you so right now i locked in

1429
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,440
the demo i was locking this to channel

1430
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,960
six on the other radios they're all

1431
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,880
scanning on all of the channels at the

1432
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,119
same time so they're hopping because i

1433
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,480
still don't i don't have enough radios i

1434
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
don't have the the 90s some odd radios

1435
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
that i would need to cover everything

1436
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,839
they're still hopping but they're

1437
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,119
hopping in a block and i think i can

1438
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,319
show you that if we come over to

1439
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,319
current

1440
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,520
we can see you'll see that this uh oh

1441
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,200
wait yeah i think that's it hold on

1442
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,119
basically what happens is that it's

1443
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,000
going to be like uh bouncing across here

1444
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,920
and we'll see moves in it so yes i'm

1445
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,760
still missing stuff but i'm catching

1446
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,079
significantly more than i was and once i

1447
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,480
know i have a target i'll lock

1448
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,319
channels to that and then it no longer

1449
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,800
hops on those so i'll fix it to like 1 6

1450
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,559
and 11 then i've got 2.4 gigahertz

1451
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,160
covered like when i'm doing an

1452
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,118
engagement does that make sense

1453
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,240
yeah exactly so the mostly i do like an

1454
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,319
analysis and figure out what my you know

1455
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,079
most interesting targets are so here if

1456
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,000
i was doing an attack on saint con i

1457
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,280
would go through and figure out where

1458
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,800
all the aps are and then i would try to

1459
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,480
lock on as many of those aps that are

1460
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,400
within range at the same time so that

1461
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,319
way i could monitor what's happening and

1462
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,079
try to look for handshakes try to look

1463
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,680
for data leaks try to look for that

1464
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,440
because being locked on a channel is

1465
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,760
going to give you the most full picture

1466
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,240
um but in a busy environment i mean we

1467
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,839
have a few hundred attendees here i

1468
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,200
don't know how many people are at sync

1469
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
on this year total but we have a lot and

1470
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,720
defcon's even bigger there was ten

1471
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,640
thousand people this year at defcon and

1472
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,160
so when you have a big environment with

1473
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,799
lots of aps lots of moving pieces i want

1474
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,160
to see as much of that picture as

1475
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,839
possible because i didn't go in with

1476
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,839
like an objective i'm not hacking you

1477
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,280
know a certain access point i just want

1478
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,960
to see as much as i can

1479
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,400
so

1480
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,400
yes

1481
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
yeah absolutely so the question is do i

1482
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,280
have any problems writing to disk uh yes

1483
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
that has always been a thing that i've

1484
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,040
done so in the previous caracan i

1485
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,359
actually had raid 0 on two hard drives

1486
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,440
to be able to keep up with the two pci

1487
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,720
express devices this one's using a

1488
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,760
single um ssd inside of here that's able

1489
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,440
to keep up with the 4x pc or 8x pcie

1490
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,680
bandwidth so the bandwidth becomes like

1491
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,520
where is the bottlenecks and every year

1492
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,040
that was the biggest bottleneck with the

1493
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,160
cactus

1494
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,440
was

1495
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,920
the hakk5 pineapple tetras only have

1496
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,799
hundred megabit ethernet ports and so i

1497
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,799
had gigabit ethernet switches so that

1498
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,799
was the bottleneck there so yeah i've

1499
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,880
definitely gone through and looked at uh

1500
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,720
where the bottlenecks are and and tried

1501
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,000
to eliminate those so um i think i'm

1502
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,839
do we still have a few more minutes

1503
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,240
i can go i can keep going you guys they

1504
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,440
say i got three more minutes so we take

1505
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,640
another question real quick i just

1506
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,400
wanted to plug my twitter uh follow me

1507

hand over here

1518
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,079
i would

1519
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,920
i would recommend you

1520
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,839
use what you already have uh for

1521
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,680
starters because like get your feet wet

1522
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,599
with that if you have a laptop install

1523
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,000
virtual machine use virtualbox it's free

1524
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,799
grab kismet um and then be able to use

1525
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,720
the existing stuff you have if you do

1526
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,480
have a budget and you're like a limited

1527
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,240
super limited budget i would say then go

1528
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,720
buy a raspberry pi 4. buy a raspberry pi

1529
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,599
4 and a wireless radio you're set back

1530
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,640
maybe like 50 bucks 60 bucks doing that

1531
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,400
and then you're like okay well what's

1532
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,760
next and then you're gonna buy batteries

1533
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,280
and then you're gonna buy more radios

1534
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,880
and then the addiction just happens and

1535
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,480
the next thing you know you're just

1536
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,000
buying all sorts of stuff and you end up

1537
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,200
spending i'm not gonna tell you how much

1538
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,280
i spent on this uh actually i will it's

1539
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,079
about 1800 bucks but uh totally worth it

1540
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,280
it's amazing um yeah thank you for your

1541
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,400
question other questions

1542
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,440
oh so

1543
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,400
alpha

1544
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,240
makes some dope stuff the problem is is

1545
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,920
i'm a sucker for latest gen technology

1546
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,040
and i wanted to make sure i was

1547
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,880
capturing in wi-fi six

1548
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,480
um and alpha currently does not make a

1549
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,520
card that supports wi-fi 6 and also has

1550
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,160
open source wireless monitoring drivers

1551
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,720
and these intel intel they've released a

1552
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,440
binary driver but it's supported by the

1553
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,040
open source community and does monitor

1554
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,359
mode so i can do full capture

1555
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,160
with the intel so intel ax200s are the

1556
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,880
chips that i use the pci express chips

1557
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,920
so

1558
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,240
