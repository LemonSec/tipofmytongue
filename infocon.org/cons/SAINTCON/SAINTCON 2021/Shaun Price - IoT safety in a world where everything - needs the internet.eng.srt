engineer

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
a little bit about me because i think

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,520
everyone

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,960
i don't know why i do these about me

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
slides i don't think most of you care

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
but i think it's kind of you have to do

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
it to make me feel awkward that's why i

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
do it

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
so i am a uvu graduate right here in the

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,440
valley

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
i was on the 10-year plan a lot of

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,199
people go to college for more than four

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,439
years they're called doctors thank you

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,480
thank you

16
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,400
um i am a wire shark slash packet

17
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
capture aficionado

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
um i've got the reputation around work

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,359
and pretty much everyone who knows me

20
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
that uh if you come to me with a problem

21
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
you better come with a pcap

22
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,000
that's just kind of how it goes

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
i have strong opinions about vlans and

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
network segmentation which kind of leads

25
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
us to why we have this talk here today

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,000
my other hobbies i'm a mountain bike

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
enthusiast here in the state of utah

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
it's a great place to live i love old

29
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
school stereo systems everything from

30
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,399
vinyls to

31
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,160
yes those vehicles you hear two miles

32
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
down the road you know still do that

33
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,120
i like fast cars 3d printing and most

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
breakfast foods

35
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
so when we talk about iot and i hate

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
using buzzwords but here i am using

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
buzzwords in my prezo in the first few

38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,479
minutes

39
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
there's two people really when it comes

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
to iot you got the first group that says

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
hey we're going to use it we're going to

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,240
use it in a you know responsible manner

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,920
and whatnot and then you have the people

44
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
that scoff and go well

45
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
i'm just never going to do it

46
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
and in a book i read back in high school

47
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
is a great book called the heretic they

48
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,439
said

49
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
the former is like locking your home

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,040
when you leave so everything's left

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
undisturbed when you turn

52
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
the ladder's like burning your house to

53
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,360
the ground

54
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
both of those are effective way to keep

55
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,079
people from getting your stuff like

56
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
honestly i'm like both of them work

57
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,560
um first one's a little bit more fun

58
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
now right now you may be wondering why

59
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,280
are you showing me a camera from 2005

60
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
am i in the right room no you are trust

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,320
me i'm going sorry i'm going somewhere

62
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,119
at this

63
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
this is an ape tech mpvr this was the

64
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,200
height of 2005 video recording

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
technology kind of

66
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,960
um it was a 640 by 480 resolution

67
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,439
uh cmos that's loose

68
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,560
cmos video sensor it did 1280 by 1024

69
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
still of image capture it was an mp3

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,480
player it was an mp4 player it was a

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
voice recorder it could read text

72
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
documents

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,480
you know what it did well

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
nothing

75
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,959
it wasn't a good camera it was a

76
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
terrible video like to watch a movie on

77
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
the 2.4 inch screen worst experience

78
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,640
ever

79
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
now how am i going to tie this in iot

80
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,519
your washing machine company probably

81
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,840
makes a good washing

82
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,200
machine your

83
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
door lock company probably makes a

84
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
decent door lock except from this

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,280
morning maybe not so much

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
what happens when they say you know what

87
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,080
we're going to do do you know what our

88
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
product needs needs an ethernet port or

89
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
wi-fi that's what it needs and so

90
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,360
they're just going to go find the

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,879
cheapest quickest way they can shove

92
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,040
that out the door and say look we have

93
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,319
internet connectivity we can add that

94
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,640
bullet point we are now iot ready and

95
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,159
we'll just leave it on the

96
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
consumers to kind of figure it out for

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,879
us

98
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
so remember as we go through some of

99
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
these things that we talked about today

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
remember the lowly ape tech

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,440
most of these things probably be done

102
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
very well

103
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
categories i want to talk about is ip

104
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,800
cameras stain with the camera theme your

105
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,519
smart tvs and the casting paradigm we'll

106
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
talk about that home automation i'm

107
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,360
really into that it's a lot of fun some

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
protocols you may or may not be using on

109
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
your home network

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
you are trust me

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
um how to get some secure remote access

112
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
and then striking this balance is this

113
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
fabled balance between security and

114
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
usability so first thing i'm going to do

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
is bring up a typical home network map

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
your home network may or may not look

117
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,040
like this i am in a room of security

118
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,319
professionals so maybe it's a little bit

119
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,920
more you know a little bit tighter than

120
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
this

121
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
but i think some of you are lying to

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
yourself to say it does not look like

123
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,640
this

124
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
you've got your flat network your

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
default and the rotor mounted yeah modem

126
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,159
router they gave you

127
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
it has the default credentials probably

128
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
doesn't hear but a lot of times it does

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
you toss some ip cameras on there some

130
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
workstations you got a nas because you

131
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,760
want to do a backup you bought some cool

132
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,439
smart light switches and then you have a

133
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
ridiculously huge cell phone in your

134
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,360
pocket

135
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,519
now let's talk about cameras that's the

136
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,400
first thing we're going to hit there's

137
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
kind of two main styles people are doing

138
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
with cameras now you've got you're

139
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
always connected you're cloud connected

140
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
um a lot of people are doing this like

141
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,918
the

142
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
vsas is what they're calling this

143
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
video surveillance as a service you've

144
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,759
got your consumer grade your rings your

145
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
arlo's your cloud cams

146
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
samsung's in the serene as well except

147
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
you actually can pull an rtsp stream

148
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
from most samsung cameras which is

149
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
pretty cool and then you got your local

150
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
cam your local style right these are the

151
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,479
folks that you roll your own you get

152
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,960
your cheap amazon aliexpress ebay

153
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
cameras

154
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
fos cam armchairs kind of some brands

155
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
you may or may not have heard of in the

156
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
past and then there's also the ubiquity

157
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
unify system lorax makes some there's a

158
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
lot of people in this arena i want to

159
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
focus on local stuff obviously you have

160
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
to run your nvr with those so we're

161
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
going to focus on the local for now

162
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
um when you look at the camera options

163
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
as you can see there's some fine quality

164
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
cameras here

165
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
um judging by the prices here we're

166
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
knocking on what 18

167
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
20

168
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
to make a camera

169
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
that has some type of compute in it and

170
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
has a video recording sensor like a

171
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,520
sensor of some sort

172
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
probably has audio ethernet of some sort

173
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
packaging shipping all that and you're

174
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,160
paying 18 for this camera

175
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
some corners are being cut folks

176
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,080
you're not getting the pinnacle of

177
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,800
security technology with these cameras

178
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
and you'd think well i'll put them on my

179
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
private network they'll be fine

180
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,000
no

181
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
people don't put them on their private

182
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,400
networks all the time so what they'll do

183
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,919
is they'll say hey let's just throw

184
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,520
these on this flat network we've got

185
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,039
them all sitting here on our default

186
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
192.8 1.0 24. and we get an nvr of some

187
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
sort you know your blue irises your

188
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
synology zone mind or shinobi they're

189
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
all good and they put them flat and they

190
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
deploy these cameras and they say great

191
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
i've got a home

192
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
home video surveillance system and i did

193
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
it for 18 a camera got a good deal right

194
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
how sure are you

195
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
that these cameras are staying local

196
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,199
are we sure

197
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,560
well this particular winner that i

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,880
bought made by our friends at hosafe.com

199
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
don't know where that naming came from

200
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
he was having a great time on all these

201
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
high udp ports reaching out to some

202
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,720
random ip address

203
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
right when i plugged him in first thing

204
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
it did

205
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
now you might be wondering well

206
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,319
you're not wondering you might be

207
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,520
thinking well look at the packet links

208
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
they're not that long there's probably

209
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
not that much data going out there it's

210
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,479
probably something it's probably

211
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
something innocuous

212
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
that said now to china

213
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
okay but and you're probably right

214
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,479
you're probably thinking it's going out

215
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
to china it's probably just for their

216
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
app is there an app there is an app for

217
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
this camera and i'm sure

218
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
i'm making finger quotes for anyone just

219
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
listening i'm sure that's secure and i'm

220
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
sure that app that you wrote so you can

221
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
get back to your camera is secure and

222
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,680
primo i promise this is a lie please

223
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
recognize the sarcasm i don't want

224
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
anyone to say i said that

225
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
please

226
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,319
yeah just heading out to china don't

227
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
know what it's doing

228
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
random udp high port

229
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
this camera is a trooper though i've had

230
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
it deployed in my house and i use this

231
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,800
like don't get me wrong i use this

232
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
camera and i'll tell you how i use it in

233
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
the future

234
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,240
this camera since i deployed it has sent

235
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
6 million

236
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
23 801 dns queries and got no answers

237
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
this is a sad camera but it's

238
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
it persists it tries

239
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
a lot to get out to the internet

240
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,160
it's doing its best it's living its best

241
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
life

242
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
because that's what mine looks like

243
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
i've got these all these cameras

244
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
vlandoff on this vlan 12

245
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
and

246
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
guess what else vlan control can do

247
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
nothing

248
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
oh surely you give it a you know you let

249
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
it have dns no no i don't it doesn't get

250
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,319
dns well you give it time sync

251
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
maybe i don't but you probably could get

252
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
away with giving a time thing on a local

253
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
source or on your on your gateway if you

254
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
really wanted to but yeah they're all

255
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
vland off living in their best life

256
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
hanging out on this vlan by themselves

257
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
guess what else they do they port scan

258
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
to say hey are there other cameras here

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
and all the other cameras go yeah yeah

260
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
we're here

261
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,599
it's kind of lonely on this network

262
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,759
there's just cameras here yeah yeah

263
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,160
that's all that's there enjoy

264
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,039
my nvr has got one single rule into that

265
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
network for an rtsp stream to reach out

266
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,080
to those cameras individually and pull

267
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
that video feed

268
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,399
and

269
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
my camera of nvr actually believe it or

270
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
not can't go anywhere else either

271
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,399
it is orphaned by itself talking to that

272
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,839
now a lot of people try to accomplish

273
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
this by dual homing your nvr don't don't

274
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
create a bridge that's a bad idea but

275
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
i've got it sitting in a protected

276
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
server network by itself in isolation

277
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
mode um doing a little east-west

278
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
filtering there so it can talk to

279
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
cameras and it can talk to me when i

280
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
actually want to pull that data up so

281
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
that's my camera paradigm feel free to

282
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
use those cheat cameras

283
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,720
just orphan them for me because they're

284
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
going to try 6 million 23 800 one times

285
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
to go do a dns query and maybe more you

286
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,519
don't know smart tvs who has a smart tv

287
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,279
hi everyone yeah remember when tvs were

288
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,360
like displays and you had like hdmi

289
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,399
ports on them and you watched tvs you

290
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,760
remember when that was a thing now it's

291
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
like well which app's best and my remote

292
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
can be a wand what is this

293
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,120
now when you set your tv up did you

294
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
carefully read all those agreements

295
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
or did you go next next next 300

296
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
watching a firefly go

297
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
i know you did because i did too

298
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
most people plop them on their default

299
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
network because that's a lot of fun just

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
shoving on there let it go out to the

301
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
internet

302
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
i did some research on the new york

303
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
times there's a company called samba tv

304
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
and they interviewed this samba tv and

305
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
they're like what do we do we do data

306
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
for tv watching

307
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
and at the end of 2016 over ninety

308
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
percent of the consumers opted into this

309
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
data watching

310
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
ninety percent nine out of ten right and

311
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,720
then subtext our business model does

312
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
subsidize a small piece of the

313
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
television hardware

314
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,519
you ever know stevie's getting cheaper

315
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
obviously there are manufacturing

316
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
improvements and whatnot and things do

317
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
get cheaper but something to think about

318
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,920
so this is them this is their

319
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
mantra so to speak stop searching and

320
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
start watching with samba tv that sounds

321
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
fun that sounds great let's do that they

322
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
make tv personal they make it

323
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
intelligent and they make it data driven

324
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
who wants in on this this sounds great

325
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
doesn't it

326
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
reading just some small things and i

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
made this way too small for myself even

328
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
with my laser vision

329
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,560
um

330
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
device information they collect some

331
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
device identifiers we may also discover

332
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,560
when your smart tv is available to

333
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
connect with a mobile device which can

334
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
for example be used to make pairing your

335
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
devices easier

336
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
hmm that's polite of them they'll scan

337
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
my network and see what mobile devices i

338
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,839

353
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
location information which is random

354
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480

355
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,399

356
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,959
online persona of uh

same show every day he is a loser

360
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
use of information go ahead and just

361
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,600
skim through that everything

362
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
we use it for everything

363
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
who gets it everyone

364
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
everyone gets it we're not gonna we're

365
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240

366
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
information you give us are we dealing

367
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,959

to everyone great

369
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
now here's the kind of the good stuff it

370
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,959
says we recognize we require tv

371
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,120
manufacturers to provide an opt-in

372
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
method there is and it's buried in your

373
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
menus during your initial setup

374
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,480
and after every patch update so every

375
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,839
time your tv updates are like hey do you

376
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,120
need to accept these new terms guess

377
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,760
what you could be opting back in

378
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,320
so when your tv patches have a look-see

379
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
see if you voted back in now me being

380
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
the

381
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
person i am and doing the things i like

382
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
to do

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
i've got this superpower and it's really

384
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
is my superpower i make things awkward

385
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
with everyone

386
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,399
and you're all like going yeah you do uh

387
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
i went into a local electronics retailer

388
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,480
i won't say which one there's a lot of

389
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
them here though

390
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,120
and i walked in with a universal remote

391
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
and i started going to every single tv

392
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
and going through every single menu to

393
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
build you this list this is your opt-out

394
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
list on how to turn that off i also

395
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
distribute the slides after someone

396
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
we're thinking about a photo or better

397
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
parenthetically

398
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
most retailers actually didn't care that

399
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
i had like a universal remote and i'm

400
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
scrolling through every menu option they

401
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,360
didn't care it was really it was really

402
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320
funny

403
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
so naturally

404
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
i'm gonna push that boundary a bit

405
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
i walked in with my laptop

406
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
an ethernet switch a few cat six cables

407
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
and start wire sharking their tvs

408
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
fun fact they don't like that

409
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
i may or may not be welcome at certain

410
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,800
electronic retailers along the wasatch

411
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
front

412
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,839
bonus

413
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
kovid i was wearing a mask

414
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
and they probably just watched this i'm

415
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
sean sorry about wire sharking your tvs

416
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,360
some managers were really cool and some

417
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
were terrible

418
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,920
like someone's like hey bud you can't do

419
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
that there's like we're gonna call the

420
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800

so that's your opt out list i'll

426
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,639
distribute that after so you can do it

427
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,399
if you really want to be paranoid and i

428
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,360
believe you

429
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
don't use a smart tv

430
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
don't give it ethernet don't give it

431
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
wi-fi use a dongle that you trust or use

432
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
your smart or use a laptop with an hdmi

433
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,839
cord

434
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
just don't give it connectivity if you

435
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,680
want to stay completely safe

436
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
if you want to kind of strike a bounce

437
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
there you can brush off your ids ips

438
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,920
skills and and segment off samba tv or

439
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
samsung and all that

440
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
um if you do have to connect to the

441
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,880
wi-fi which

442
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
i'm i'm dreading the day when your tv

443
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
has to activate itself but if it does

444
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,160
happen

445
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
you could do host isolation on your

446
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
access point and i'll get a little bit

447
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
more into that in the future or in this

448
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,480
talk soon

449
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
uh who recognizes this symbol right here

450
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
google cast we all like google cast

451
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
right means whatever you've got you can

452
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
play it bigger bigger screen bigger

453
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
speakers better all that well be thanks

454
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
to the beauty of mdns google cast make

455
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
sure everyone knows what you're doing

456
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
it says hey

457
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
you've got this nifty chromecast and

458
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
you've named it feeder cheesecake

459
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
fun fact feeder cheesecake was supposed

460
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
to be theater chromecast but autocorrect

461
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
and i am too lazy to change it

462
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
so literally i cast to the theater

463
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
cheesecake and i do like cheesecake so

464
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
it works this bottom here you see a lot

465
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,399
of the fields here you can actually

466
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,760
google this and get the whole spec out

467
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,399
there but uh fn your friendly name and

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
then right here is your application

469
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
youtube is what you're at

470
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
in now what happens if you're on android

471
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
phone and you're in the same broadcast

472
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
domain on the same segment you get this

473
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,279
notification ever seen this on their

474
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
android phone before someone's casting

475
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
on your network they're testing plex is

476
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
the application

477
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,839
now

478
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
this is a recent change but historically

479
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,680
when the chromecast first came out if

480
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
you decided to cast a

481
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
a web page right a web page it would

482
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
actually go show the name of the webpage

483
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,160
of the video you're casting

484
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
so let's just say you're on a

485
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
totally safe for work video website and

486
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
you start casting

487
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
everyone in your layer 2 network

488
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
knows what you're watching

489
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,279
that has now changed luckily it just

490
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,079
gives you the application name

491
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
but before when people were casting from

492
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,639
certain websites they made sure everyone

493
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,880
knows if you want to turn that off right

494
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
there in the google home app head on

495
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,079
over to

496
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,320
this option right here we say let others

497
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,560
control your cast media turn that off

498
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
and that will keep it from letting

499
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
everyone know what application in the

500
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
chromecast universe you're watching

501
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
unless they have a linux box handy

502
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
or if you just query for this using

503
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
avahi it'll give you everything you want

504
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
about the chromecast anyway even if you

505
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,839
turn that off so

506
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
sorry

507
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,880
be careful which linux boxes you let

508
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,440
them have out there right

509
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
i want to talk about

510
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
home automation now and lighting right

511
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
this is a big arena now um

512
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
in this arena you've got two styles

513
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,160
again you're going to notice this

514
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,519
pattern you've got your cloud connected

515
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,519
and all of you have obviously they'll

516
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
say something like hey this is hub free

517
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,600
or this is google home or amazon alexa

518
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
branded and they're almost always wi-fi

519
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,800
they're always they're almost always

520
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,600
going to run on 2.4 gig so we can't kill

521
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
off that spectrum at home but they'll

522
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
always run there

523
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
um

524
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
and there's tons of options there's some

525
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
that are legit obviously there's the tp

526
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
link costas are there out there the

527
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
levitons phillips hughes really popular

528
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,119
but i want to focus a little bit more on

529
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
these right here

530
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
these random light switches that you're

531
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
buying now i took this slide a while ago

532
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,520
when i do my first research they've

533
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
actually gotten cheaper you can actually

534
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,319
get these down to about nine dollars a

535
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,760
light switch now

536
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
for a wi-fi connected light switch nine

537
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,839
dollars remember the ape tech

538
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,439
the other option obviously is to do it

539
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
local um you got your zigbees your z

540
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,919
waves do you remember x10 x10 home

541
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
automation did anyone ever have one of

542
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
their doorbells turned into an alarm at

543
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,039
2 am

544
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
yeah that made x10 get thrown out pretty

545
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
quick for me but whatever

546
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
these hubs can be their offline or

547
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
offline local or cloud connected your

548
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
offline ones would be your habitats your

549
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,760
home assistants openhab great projects

550
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
um the other option would be like a

551
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
samsung smartthings where you have a

552
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
local hub but it does it does have a

553
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
cloud connected piece but i want to talk

554
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
specifically about these solid um

555
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
cheap light switches now i don't want to

556
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
disparage any company in particular and

557
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
actually after writing the slides up and

558
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
sending a few emails most of these have

559
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
been shown up which is great this is

560
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
progress and this is fantastic however i

561
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,880
want to look at this problem more

562
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,799
holistically because i think it is still

563
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
an issue when we start diving for the

564
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
cheapest possible ways to do something

565
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,480
so here we have a light switch

566
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,039
18.99 for a smart switch 252 positive

567
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,960
customer reviews that seems like a

568
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,160
winner to me

569
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
so i looked at one i actually bought one

570
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
to say that i have purchased the product

571
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
i never installed it and you'll see why

572
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
went to the website

573
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
okay looks like a modern website

574
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440

what's pleasant

583
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,039
why wouldn't i sign up for this webpage

584
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
this is pleasant

585
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
i did happen to notice though they've

586
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
got a sign-in page all right that's

587
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,440
probably their like this is their

588
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
marketing page let's head over to their

589
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,039
app stage see what that looks like

590
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
um i don't know how well you can see

591
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,039
this in the back but you don't see

592
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
anything missing like where the giant

593
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
red arrow is

594
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
yeah it's clear text port 80. there's

595
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
nothing there so then i thought okay

596
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
cool it's just the landing page once i

597
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
get out to the federated logins it'll be

598
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,840
fine let's go ahead and create an

599
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,919
account nope

600
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
still clear

601
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
awkward

602
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,640
needless to say i did not create an

603
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
account on this site today

604
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,799
uh doing a little more digging i looked

605
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,320
up the whois there was pretty much no

606
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
information about it whatsoever but some

607
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
random place in china

608
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,600
like i pointed out previously there was

609
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
no ssl on their side page they were

610
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
using jaw tokens for their

611
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
authentication which is nice but there's

612
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
no cell to mitigate a man in the middle

613
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
and without that nice ca signed

614
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
certificate authority saying yes these

615
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
people are who they are i would never

616
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
want to put any information there so i

617
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,919
thought okay the app's probably better

618
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
let's download the app on a burner phone

619
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,880
not on my prod phone

620
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
ask for some permissions

621
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,360
okay i want location

622
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
location well maybe they want to see me

623
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
drive up to my house and they'll turn

624
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
the lights on okay benefited out photos

625
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
media files

626
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,200
okay

627
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,760
struggling a little bit with this one

628
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
storage

629
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,039
settings maybe you want to put my phone

630
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,679
whatever camera

631
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,200
what am i going to take a picture okay

632
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
take a picture of a qr code on the light

633
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
switch gives me instructions maybe

634
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
benefit of that we're still doing it

635
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,320
microphone

636
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,600
voice control maybe

637
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
wi-fi connection information device in

638
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
app history contacts are you going to

639
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
call my mom and say sean turned his

640
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,640
lights on again

641
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
and by the way we want phone and others

642
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
too right

643
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,919
yeah needs to say i never install it

644
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
just take this as a word of warning they

645
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,679
have they now have ssl good for them

646
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,960
they've got other things going for them

647
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
which is great i'm just saying if you

648
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,559
want to keep your home automation stuff

649
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,440
happy

650
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
do it local and it's gotten cheap enough

651
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
that you don't have to rely on the third

652
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
party shady sites

653
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
let's talk protocols i love protocols

654
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
here we go

655
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,559
um here's a network map again i love

656
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,840
bringing this up you notice i've changed

657
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
everything to our playstation and our

658
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,440
xbox we still have a nas we have a

659
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
tablet phone that's a switch looks great

660
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
you probably already know where i'm

661
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
going to go with this and i already

662
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
apologize for the volume this might get

663
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,400
loud

664
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
i want to introduce you

665
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
to the kool-aid man of protocols

666
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,320
upnp oh yeah

667
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
for those that don't know upnp our good

668
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
friend makes it easy to punch a hole in

669
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
your firewall and give nat or pat to a

670
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,799
specific ip with no user interaction

671
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
does that sound like a great idea to

672
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
anyone

673
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
now a lot of multiplayer games have

674
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
foregone the whole idea of saying hey

675
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,840
we're going to have a lobby that we host

676
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,799
you're going to connect to our game

677
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
servers it'll be great they say hey just

678
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,960
go ahead and start a lobby and then

679
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
we'll do player lobbies and player

680
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
hosting and peer-to-peer stuff have you

681
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
ever like plugged in a console and had

682
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
to check your nat type and seen it see

683
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
strict or a d or something like that

684
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
that's because you don't have upnp on

685
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
it goes out and does it what does that

686
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
look like on the wire that's what it

687
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
looks like it says hey everyone i'm the

688
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
router and if you want to talk to me i

689
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,320
will forward all the ports you want you

690
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
betcha just let me know so that's what

691
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
that looks like on the wire

692
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
my advice

693
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
turn it off

694
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,520
and i'll tell you why

695
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
if you want to forward something into

696
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,559
your private network that should

697
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
probably be a conscious decision and i

698
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,600
always say this i always use this

699
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
analogy when you invite guests to your

700
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,320
home

701
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
do you invite them to enter through a

702
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,919
door or do you allow them to chainsaw a

703
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,720
hole in your inside of your house

704
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,640
please use the door that's what it was

705
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
designed for that's i make that decision

706
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,240
whether you can come in and out please

707
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
do not chain saw my house

708
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
now

709
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
i can already see the scoffing not not

710
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
in this group but some people when i

711
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,960
start talking and remember the strong

712
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
opinions about vlan segmentation here we

713
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,679
are

714
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,080
um so yeah you do some port forwards so

715
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,280
what

716
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
well here's one app

717
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,159
um i talked about blue iris right

718
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,280
2916 have it exposed to the internet

719
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
right now now bluerice does have an

720
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
authentication page to it that you may

721
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,240
enable

722
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,799
or you may not i'm not going to say

723
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
whether i clicked on any of those links

724
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
because that would be wrong to ingress

725
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
into someone's never without permission

726
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,200
but i have heard that if you click on

727
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
some of those links you could be looking

728
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
at the interior of things i've heard i

729
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,799
wouldn't know

730
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,840
now remember when i said when everyone

731
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
puts their wireless camera or puts their

732
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,520
ip cameras inside in their protector

733
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,799
remember when i said that and no one

734
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,320
would port forward that

735
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
well five million one hundred seven

736
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
thousand seven twenty four by searching

737
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
for ip camera told me that was a lie

738
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,679
people are exposing these to the

739
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,919
internet and if you look at some of the

740
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,120
actual

741
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,440
um the information on the headers

742
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
they're straight raw ip cameras just

743
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,480
expose right to the internet today

744
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,960
so let's not be like that

745
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
home automation

746
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
this is from hubitat this is their

747
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
support person that hangs out in the

748
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,200
forums says just a reminder that we do

749
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,279
not recommend port forwarding to enable

750
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
roam access your habitat elevation hub

751
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,159
especially without password protection

752
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,480
well 273 people decided that was silly

753
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,960
now a lot of people are saying well what

754
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
are they going to do turn your lights on

755
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
and off now if you heard in the previous

756
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
presentation they're saying your

757
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
deadbolt is actually the way of security

758
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
plus which it is however if i have

759
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960
access to your hub what does that matter

760
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
if i have access to your hub i can open

761
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
your door

762
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
i bet you probably integrated it with

763
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,039
your garage door so now i can open your

764
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,960
garage door and you literally did a port

765
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,760
forward to a device that was never meant

766
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,159
to live on the internet now there are

767
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,360
secure ways to do that and we'll talk

768
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,600
about that but just as like i i love to

769
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
make these real and say yes people are

770
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
doing this and happening out in the wild

771
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
now

772
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
i focused a lot on um home stuff right a

773
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
lot of home iot all that i want to talk

774
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
about enterprise that surely never

775
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,760
happens in enterprise i literally just

776
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,480
googled mitsubishi electric

777
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
they make hvac equipment and i found 86

778
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,600
people that put their air conditioning

779
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
control system on the web

780
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
i guarantee well maybe not maybe you do

781
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,080
have a mitsubishi control system at your

782
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
home which you have a giant house or

783
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,240
some commercial needs which is cool but

784
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,919
86 folks thought they'd put that on the

785
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
internet which and i can already tell

786
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
you the user story the user story is a

787
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
contractor said we need access to this

788
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
to do remote diagnostics new work on it

789
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,360
we need you to expose this to us on the

790
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
internet

791
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
that's probably what it went down ask me

792
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
how i know that and i can go into more

793
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
detail but i won't do it on camera

794
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
um

795
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
on that topic though

796
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
one other thing i want to i want to

797
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
point out

798
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,400
sorry i'm trying to look at this

799
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,799
backwards port 8081 are you really

800
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
fooling anyone really we're gonna move

801
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,799
to 8081 that'll work

802
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,080
so

803
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
it's happening now on that topic of

804
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
corporate hvac controllers how many

805
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,080
people have seen those self-serve

806
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
markets where like if you've got like a

807
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
break room in your in your office you

808
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
could actually go buy something and that

809
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,279
where's that plugged down on your

810
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,279
corporate network is that is that on

811
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,960
your internal workstations

812
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,679
do you have it on a segregated network

813
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,760
questions to ponder right

814
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,919
the newest one that i found interesting

815
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,159
temperature scanning devices and kiosks

816
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,679
thanks to the pandemic has anyone seen

817
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,039
those the automated scannings where you

818
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
walk up to it and scandia

819
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,480
facilities said they needed one of those

820
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,840
they plop it down they saw an ethernet

821
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,120
jack

822
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,640
and popped it in

823
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,000
where did that go

824
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
is that on your corporate protected

825
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,320
network is that on an iot network things

826
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
to consider

827
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
door control systems for your badges to

828
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,400
badge in and out of your office um fun

829
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
fact fun story about that one i i've got

830
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
alerts that basically

831
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
are looking at any time something gets

832
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
plugged into my corporate network it

833
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,120
sends an alert if it doesn't match what

834
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,279
my corporate machines look like right

835
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,120
it'll say hey you generally have a name

836
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
like this

837
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,520
this is something different and

838
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,559
sometimes it just didn't get the host

839
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,480
name in an ideal world we'd all have

840
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
80.1x and it'd automatically move you to

841
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,919
what network you want but

842
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,039
sadly a lot of people haven't gone that

843
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,960
direction yet because it requires work

844
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
also i see a raspberry pi plugged in and

845
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,360
i was like great here we go gotta go

846
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,679
find who plugged a pie in so i start

847
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,679
running down trying to find it looking

848
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,520
for the usual suspects that would do

849
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
something like this can't find it based

850
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,039
on the network i knew where it was like

851
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
where in the building was i'm like where

852
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,039
on earth is this pie

853
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,559
and i'm walking around and i'm walking

854
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,159
around i can't find it

855
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,000
and then i look over and in the

856
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,919
facilities area they're testing a new

857
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,240
building control system

858
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,840
and i said and it doesn't look like a

859
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,919
pie it is in a hard metal box it looks

860
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
like a legit piece of hardware and i go

861
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
did you just plug that inside oh yeah

862
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
we're testing out it's great

863
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,559
yeah it was a raspberry pi in a big

864
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,120
metal box

865
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
my anger is strong no it's fine

866
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
just tell me if you're going to plug

867
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,919
something like that i'll tell you where

868
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,120
to put it and we can make it a nice

869
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
little spot

870
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,120
um so i i'd be a mess without a winnie

871
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
the pooh meme of course

872
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
allowing upmp to forge your ports

873
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
performing manual pat forwarding or do

874
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,919
what i like to do only for it in a vpn

875
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,200
now i don't know has anyone ever heard

876
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
zero tier

877
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
zero tier really awesome if you don't

878
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,679
want to deal with certificates and all

879
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,799
the other stuff and the

880
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
uncomfortableness that comes with vpns

881
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
zero tier's your ticket basically you

882
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
drop a client on your machine you could

883
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,200
also put it on your firewall or your

884
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,600
router your edge device you join it via

885
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,240
their web portal the unique id an

886
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,600
administrator has to go and accept it

887
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
you can push routes down to everyone

888
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
completely decentralized

889
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,159
you can actually do layer 2 bridging if

890
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,399
you want to play old school uh lan games

891
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
like old school stuff you can do some

892
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
cool layer tube bridging fantastic for

893
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,880
this it's free up to 50 devices go ahead

894
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,919
and try it

895
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,279
excuse me you can put on your phone if

896
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,080
you want to look at your cameras

897
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,159
remotely you can do gateway redirection

898
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,840
if you want to browse safely in a coffee

899
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
shop any of that good stuff

900
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,880
um so yeah it's a great option so now

901
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
the stuff that we need to add like i've

902
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
tried this slide all right fine you've

903
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
convinced me which i don't think i've

904
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
convinced anyone here this is mostly

905
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,159
best practices this is stuff we've been

906
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
knowing for years but we kind of forget

907
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,880
about

908
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
so what do you need to do and i'm going

909
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,679
to say the first one i might get some

910
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
hate ditch your consumer grade router

911
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
firewall access point all in one that

912
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,640
you bought sorry say goodbye to it or if

913
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,120
it will run double dwrt or openwork cool

914
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
you can still use it

915
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
get rid of it and i'll tell you why

916
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,679
those now on that note you're going to

917
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,279
say well that sounds really expensive

918
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
have you seen how much the new fancy

919
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,399
ones with the alien antennas look like

920
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,279
on them

921
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,000
are you going to spend 300 on

922
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,120
a tiny

923
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
tiny little access point right so it's

924
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,679
not a money thing but get an older pc

925
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,960
or there's tons of great options in the

926
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,399
second hand market then i can talk more

927
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,240
about those in detail later if you want

928
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
to find me

929
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,559
and put an open source router

930
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
distribution on it

931
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,600
get yourself a switch that can do some

932
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
vlans

933
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
and get yourself an access point and

934
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,919
i'll show you some things that we need

935
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,200
to do with that

936
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
um get an older pc install open source

937
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,440
distro there's a ton of them and they're

938
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,760
great there's open sense there's psense

939
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
untangled not all of these are open

940
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
source that's kind of a misfor thing on

941
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
the slides untangle sofos utm xg

942
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
bios clear os

943
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,880
tons of options try them all find the

944
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,320
one you like the most

945
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,480
because all of them will probably have

946
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
more features than you're used to which

947
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,799
is great i personally have tried them

948
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,720
all i'm an open sense guy i've been

949
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
running it for years and years and years

950
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
i love it and i'll show you a little bit

951
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,320
more

952
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,919
um but yeah give a try see which one

953
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,039
works for you

954
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,880
now get yourself a switch that can do

955
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
vlans now you can say well those are

956
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,960
pretty expensive second hand enterprise

957
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
ones 60 bucks i'm not kidding even

958
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
during the global chip shortage you can

959
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,960
still get them because enterprises are

960
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,000
throwing them away because they're old

961
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
and outdated

962
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,240
i don't care that much they're all

963
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
outdated as long as they work for me now

964
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
we could have the argument well they're

965
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
not getting security updates but that's

966
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
another day

967
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,120
if you want to go the new route totally

968
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
get it 24 port reputable vendor 100

969
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
bucks right now today you can get them

970
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
today if you want cheap options and you

971
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
want to go that this little i don't know

972
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
how to pronounce this zeixl

973
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,559
xl whatever it's 25

974
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,440
it does vlans it does qos does jumbo

975
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
frames it'll do link aggregation i've

976
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
actually deployed several of those and

977
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,159
they've been nothing but great they're

978
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,120
25

979
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
okay

980
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,200
so

981
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
the third piece of that is get a

982
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,720
standalone access point and the reason

983
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
why is you want to do three main things

984
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,799
you want to be able to do vlan tagging

985
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,480
you want to be able to do guest

986
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
isolation and you want to run multiple

987
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,519
ssids

988
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,000
now tons of options in this arena now

989
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,519
remember you don't have to replace the

990
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
whole wi-fi for your house to do this

991
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,039
you could actually just buy one of these

992
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
standalone access points just to serve

993
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,799
your iot and your guest networks and all

994
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,480
that stuff it doesn't have to be blazing

995
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,559
fast you can get in the ruckus r500

996
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,360
range for 50 bucks i probably since i've

997
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
been preaching home labbing and all this

998
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
stuff i've probably led people to

999
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
install 25 to 30 of those

1000
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
and everyone loves them they're great

1001
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
but they do all these great features

1002
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,279
um ubiquity is great you can get

1003
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,120
various options in those tp-link has

1004
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,039
some in the head arena as well

1005
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,799
and this is why you need one

1006
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
it gives you this wonderful option right

1007
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,440
here

1008
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,360
to do wireless client isolation which

1009
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,760
means your wireless clients on the same

1010
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,440
ssid cannot talk to each other period

1011
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,480
so when you add an iot device to your

1012
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,519
network

1013
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,519
it's a lonely iot by itself and it

1014
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
doesn't know anyone exists it is

1015
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,679
completely by itself cue the forever

1016
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,200
alone meme right now

1017
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
um you can also say you can't talk to

1018
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
anything wired on this network either so

1019
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
if you truly want to segment stuff off

1020
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
you can do this today 50 is the entry

1021
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,760
points they obviously have more

1022
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
expensive ones you get up there but this

1023
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,279
is a great way to start

1024
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,679
and it's a great way to start kind of

1025
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,440
siphoning off these things and and if

1026
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,480
you were trying to look into this

1027
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,559
project as i need to change everything

1028
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,640
today you're going to fail

1029
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,559
because it's too much it's too much to

1030
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,480
ingest and too much to figure out

1031
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
take a bit by bit

1032
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
build your your ssid for your iot

1033
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,120
devices get the settings set up how you

1034
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,919
want them and grab one thing and move it

1035
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
and have a look does it still work great

1036
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
are my rules too restrictive are they

1037
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,200
too

1038
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,279
permissive do we need to adjust things

1039
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
move those things in bit by bit

1040
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,919
eventually you'll have them all in there

1041
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,720
now

1042
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
i always like to start with the iot

1043
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
wireless

1044
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,159
ssid stuff i start there first i've got

1045
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,679
one that's basically the same name of my

1046
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,120
access point underscore iot

1047
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
and i have host isolation mode so they

1048
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,480
can't talk to each other and then i

1049
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
start with a very permissive rule set

1050
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,840
because i don't want it to break while

1051
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
i'm in the process if you want to upset

1052
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
the people in your house start breaking

1053
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,080
the things they've come accustomed to

1054
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
so start simple and it's okay to be

1055
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,159
overly permissive um you can use some

1056
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
cool tools like entopng or other netflow

1057
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,399
tools to see who it's reaching out to

1058
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,640
and how much data if it's reaching out

1059
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,720
to something once in a blue moon it may

1060
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
or may not be critical for that device

1061
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
function you could probably kill it off

1062
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,560
so i want to take a practical look at

1063
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,918
that

1064
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,679
this is ntopng has anyone ever used

1065
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
dentopng

1066
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,560
cool a few people

1067
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,399
totally free it's built into open sense

1068
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,399
you just add it as a plugin and it can

1069
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,679
visualize everything across your network

1070
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,800
everything that crosses through that

1071
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,520
gateway it can visualize it so as a case

1072
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
study

1073
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
i chose a car wall charger right here

1074
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,399
and you see it's on vlan 5 which is my

1075
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,918
iotv line

1076
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,918
and then it's got some 700 megs worth of

1077
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
data that's transferred back and forth

1078
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
so i've identified this device and then

1079
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
i can drill down

1080
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,679
and take a look at the application

1081
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
protocols that it talks now these slides

1082
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,879
are out of order so this is more of a

1083
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,960
holistic view of the whole network but

1084
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,480
on the next one these are the

1085
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
applications it's used amazon cloudfare

1086
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,800
probably tells me that the coordination

1087
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
for this device is out in ec2 somewhere

1088
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
and we probably need to keep that going

1089
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,320
and you can set rules to say hey you can

1090
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
talk out dc2 that's just fine not a

1091
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,599
problem graham to be a little permissive

1092
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,760
but if it is in a situation like this

1093
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
it's probably the the best thing one

1094
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,119
interesting thing i saw down here at the

1095
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,160
bottom

1096
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,680
why is my car charger talking tor

1097
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,280
that was shored up as i made this talk

1098
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,160
um you know ntp no big deal tls

1099
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,119
obviously

1100
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,640
um so yeah they're using amazon

1101
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,800
cloudflare dhp stuff like that so that's

1102
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,079
how you roll it down

1103
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,440
if you wanted to whittle down even

1104
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,800
further you can click on one of those

1105
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
hosts or one of those endpoints and then

1106
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
get the virus total reputation on it so

1107
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,400
if you don't know what that is you can

1108
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
actually click on that and say here's

1109
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,599
the reputation that we think that this

1110
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,640
site is now if you did this on a ip

1111
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
camera for example it'll be lit up red a

1112
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
lot of stuff since things are on amazon

1113
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,680
it's gonna say yeah it's an ec2 instance

1114
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,800
what are you going to do about it that's

1115
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,760
kind of where you get into it

1116
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,800
so

1117
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
coming full circle here what does it

1118
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
look like when you're done

1119
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,720
this is a lie it's never done

1120
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,400
it's always it's you'll be tweaking this

1121
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
forever but

1122
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
mine currently looks like this right now

1123
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
i've got a dmz

1124
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
on vlan 15 right here what that dmz is

1125
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,839
that's for my aj proxy that's where

1126
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,359
that's out listening that's where my

1127
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,359
traffic listeners or my or my virtual

1128
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,839
ips live if i want to bring something in

1129
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,200
for a test i don't leave things

1130
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,440
permanently ingressing in but sometimes

1131
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
you do need to test a quick thing and it

1132
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,520
lives in the dmz with its listener and

1133
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
then it forwards something in the server

1134
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,200
data network i've got a workstation vlan

1135
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
for all my hard-wired things i've got

1136
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
the ip camera island of sadness over

1137
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,200
here

1138
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,960
i have a voip network because i thought

1139
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,800
it would be really cool to have like

1140
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
phones in every room so i did my own

1141
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,280
like astrix server and i had like a sip

1142
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
phone in like each room and then i

1143
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,400
remembered i live by myself

1144
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
and like i'd literally like call another

1145
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,680
room like oh it's ringing

1146
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,040
and then i like do announcements i'm

1147
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,720
like this is announcement this is sean

1148
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,880
dinner will be in half an hour

1149
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,119
thanks sean you know

1150
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
i still have it maybe i'll use it again

1151
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,119
i don't know um i do have iot for wi-fi

1152
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,079
and wired i do have a guest wi-fi

1153
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,640
network and it is open and a lot of

1154
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,520
people are probably scratching your head

1155
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,960
saying sean why do you have a guest

1156
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,280
wi-fi network because it's super

1157
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
interesting the things people give up

1158
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
when they want free wi-fi

1159
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
super interesting you want my facebook

1160
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
login you betcha

1161
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,240
um nothing nefarious of course

1162
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,320
and and then i've got one for towns

1163
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
phones this i like to separate those

1164
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
from my workstations just just for my

1165
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
own like organizational reasons and all

1166
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,520
that stuff

1167
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,040
but yeah that's what mine looks like it

1168
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
will probably evolve 30 more times by

1169
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
the time i tell someone about this again

1170
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
but that's currently how it is

1171
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,320
on that note does anyone have any

1172
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,960
questions for me

1173
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,839
yes

1174
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,800
okay cool that's a very good question so

1175
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
what depending on the type of device

1176
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,839
let's just take a device that requires

1177
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
mdns for example right a casting device

1178
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,800
right

1179
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
if you've got all your iot chromecasts

1180
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
hanging out on an iot network that are

1181
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,280
um isolated and all my tablets are on a

1182
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
different vehicle had it you have to

1183
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,400
have some form of bridge to bridge that

1184
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,320
mdns traffic and that's what's known as

1185
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
an avahi reflector and that's actually a

1186
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,839
package in open sense you can install

1187
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,400
and say anything mdns on this network i

1188
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,920
want to reflect over there so if i do

1189
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,760
want to cast something out i can do that

1190
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,839
and bridge those two networks um in

1191
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,000
other cases where it's like

1192
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
i need to do a discovery to find all my

1193
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,320
other peers on the sad network sometimes

1194
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
you have to open up a rule to let that

1195
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,839
happen and then lock it back down

1196
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,760
and sometimes you have to basically fire

1197
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
the device or say goodbye to a device

1198
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,000
that you maybe don't need much more

1199
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,119
i had one

1200
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
one brand of camera i did like the

1201
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
picture quality was amazing it was fast

1202
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,720
it was stable it's a wonderful it was

1203
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,960
great but it hammered and tried to

1204
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,119
hammer at least everything every few

1205
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,320
seconds like hey give me all your

1206
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,079
cameras hey find me all the cameras so

1207
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,200
much that my firewall was actually

1208
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
bouncing every time that would happen it

1209
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
would kind of like start hurting my

1210
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,119
performance back when i had a lower

1211
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,880
performing firewall so i end up having

1212
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,160
to fire that camera unfortunately

1213
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,480
any more questions sorry i feel like a

1214
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,119
whopper under the heat lights right now

1215
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
yeah go ahead

1216
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,079
huh

1217
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,320
yes so i have actually gone through and

1218
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,520
that was kind of the point where me

1219
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,800
going to the store that will remain

1220
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
unnamed that i'm no longer welcome at um

1221
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
i wanted to opt out and then wireshark

1222
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
to see if it's all tried because i could

1223
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,000
only try on the tvs that i had in my own

1224
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
house um which

1225
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
i wish i had the budget to buy every tv

1226
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,680
i do not um but yes i have opted out and

1227
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,160
then seen traffic go to unknown unknown

1228
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,200
ec2 instances and stuff where i'm like i

1229
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,960
don't know what this is i opted out but

1230
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,320
they're obviously still something going

1231
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,000
out and they're really tricky with the

1232
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
domains they're using so there's not

1233
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
really an easy like dns thing one thing

1234
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,000
i can say absolutely should do is run

1235
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,480
piehole or next dns on your home network

1236
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,000
to kill all those advertising domains

1237
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,119
right from the get go that's probably

1238
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,640
the first thing i would do

1239
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,560
um second thing i've done is i've

1240
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,960
actually profiled my tv and said okay

1241
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
and within top ng you can actually see

1242
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
the application breakdown and say okay

1243
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
for my application you're allowed

1244
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,760
netflix euro filed youtube you're

1245
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
allowed these particular like cdns you

1246
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
know where they where they distribute

1247
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,119
their video or their their video

1248
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,720
distribution networks and locked it down

1249
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,200
to that granted your tv will be kind of

1250
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
funky because some features that

1251
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
normally

1252
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,119
are quiet and they just don't work will

1253
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,119
start barking at you

1254
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
but i found using

1255
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,280
your your pie hole or your next dns to

1256
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,119
kind of kill those advertising ones that

1257
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,800
actually worked pretty well

1258
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
yes in the back

1259
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,799
right

1260
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,400
absolutely and i've i've seen very

1261
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
similar behavior where they'll be like

1262
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,079
thanks for that dns server you gave me

1263
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,720
dhp i'm gonna use mine i'm like oh no

1264
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,079
you don't actually i have a rule on my

1265
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,240
firewall both in corporate and at home

1266
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
these are the allowed dns server and

1267
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,560
it's mine and no one else

1268
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,480
i think there's another question

1269
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,480
somewhere

1270
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,040
i have seen a lot of that work i've

1271
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,880
never done any myself it seems super

1272
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
cool because obviously it's just a

1273
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,319
sensor and some and some software right

1274
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,640
so i seem super upfront i just i don't

1275
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
care that the cameras are naughty

1276
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,040
because they're living in their sad

1277
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
little network like be naughty like

1278
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,319
whatever you know um

1279
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,079
oh yes

1280
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
um i was given one as a promotional item

1281
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
at a large convention that does

1282
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
virtualization

1283
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,599
you can make any guesses there if you

1284
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,560
want uh they handed me a plug a little

1285
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
smart plug in there and absolutely it

1286
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,200
was reaching out to who knows what and

1287
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,720
and and honestly it probably is reaching

1288
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
out to their application servers so you

1289
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,240
can control their app but 100 yes like i

1290
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,599
unless you're going from like a

1291
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,359
reputable manufacturer like your your

1292
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
philips hues your your levitons your um

1293
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,960
tp-link costs like that i just avoid

1294
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
them honestly

1295
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,160
it's just rolling your own home

1296
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,240
automation is nowhere near as complex

1297
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,839
and terrible as it used to be the

1298
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,520
solutions now even the diy ones where

1299
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,119
you get a raspberry pi and put a radio

1300
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,960
in it they're pretty straightforward

1301
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,160
they're pretty great

1302
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,760
and and then the other thing is you're

1303
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,359
not locked in right like that was always

1304
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,640
my biggest complaint is if you buy a

1305
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
cloud connected device you're married to

1306
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,800
it until you throw it away i've changed

1307
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,200
my home automation hub four times now

1308
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,599
i've done i've done hubitat which i'm on

1309
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,079
currently i've done samsung smart things

1310
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,000
i've done

1311
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,400
openhab and home assistant and each time

1312
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
i do it if anyone's ever done z-wave i

1313
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,960
had to unpair and repair every device

1314
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
yes it's miserable but at least i didn't

1315
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,400
have to pull them out of my walls so

1316
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,440
cool there's no more questions i'll hang

1317
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,560
