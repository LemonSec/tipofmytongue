1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
have to be careful if you

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,439
over network then you find yourself

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,680
getting roped into presenting even if

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,759
you didn't want to so there is that

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,200
scheme of it that you have to balance

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
that um

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,280
so the topic that i wanted to talk about

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
a little bit is one of these questions i

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,039
get asked all the time

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,840
i'm in a k-12 environment

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
but as security professionals

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,359
you know pretty much everything's on the

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
internet these days and so we get asked

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
a lot of questions about hey is this

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
website safe or can i use it or not

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,399
so

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,200
we ended up and kind of me figuring out

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
how i wanted to answer that question

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
more effectively

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,160
i decided i needed to have like a

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
process or set of tools i was going to

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,320
use instead of just viewing websites and

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
see seeing if my star went off right

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,079
um so obviously key piece of this is

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
what is you know is a website safe is

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,920
going to depend on your organizational

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,039
arrangement

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
right and what that looks like

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
for myself in the k-12 industry right we

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
have quite a few things

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,359
that we have to pay attention to just

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
like you do in the payments industry or

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
government industry or defense

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
contractors all those things gonna have

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
their own standard

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,240
but in the case of in my world right

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
these are the types of things that i'm

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,000
paying attention to one of the ones that

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,960
can be kind of the most

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
kind of the most challenging is the

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
advertising practices right because i

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,920
have to protect students and i can't set

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
them up to be advertised to so that

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
kills a lot of website opportunities and

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
different tools out there

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,119
um mainly because i'm a meme guy or i'm

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,439
dating myself right but

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
pretty much any and all these questions

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
can be answered with various tools

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,240
so

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
my approach here is more about kind of

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
intermediate to beginner tools i'm just

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
kind of how to be able to initially

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
sample or kind of check on those things

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
there are other presenters that are way

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
smarter than i am that are doing things

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,159
on like burp suite and a lot of other

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,360
things that are

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
way more red team aspect these are more

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
kind of easy blue team check offs um

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,239
so i kind of break the tools into a

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
couple areas

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,800
the first one is kind of what i call a

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
common sense review

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
and honestly when i look at the requests

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,959
that end up in front of me to approve or

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,160
not approve

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
if people would just do the common sense

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,879
check

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
it would have skipped the entire

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
conversation

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
um so something that i've been able to

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,879
use this type of concept for is is when

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,879
we do annual trainings or i get to send

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,840
out the

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,239
security or whatever based email it's

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,280
like hey

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
ask yourself these five questions about

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
a website right you know do i see

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
advertisements on the website do i have

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
to log in

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
um you know one of the things that

83
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
people have a tendency to forget is like

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
hey

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
on the bottom of just about every single

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
website that you want to do any business

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
with there's going to be a terms and

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
conditions or a privacy policy or

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
contact us or illegal or something

90
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
and you can usually discern and find out

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
very quickly what that website does or

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
doesn't do

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,360
it's kind of an interesting interesting

94
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
practice to use it on yourself to go see

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
hey these are websites i like to use

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
what are they doing with my information

97
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
but this common sense review is honestly

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
probably the most important step

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
especially when i'm trying to get users

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
to help me answer this question

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
now i support 8 000 staff so

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,799
getting them all to help me answer that

103
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,400
question reduces the volume that i have

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
to deal with it

105
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
but there's a couple of tools out there

106
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
that i found

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
can be particularly helpful for me

108
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
the first one is called

109
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,799
pentesttools.com

110
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
they do have like a paid version that

111
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
does a lot more detailed drill down

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
but they also have a free version um

113
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
you'll see i have a personal vendetta

114
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
against coolmathgames.com because

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
everybody claims it's educational and

116
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
it's 2000 java games that you don't have

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
to use any math on

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
so all of my examples about security

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
testing are just a small hidden not so

120
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
hidden agenda against cool math games

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,959
um

122
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,680
but the free version of the pen test

123
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
tools you'll see this is an example

124
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,159
where i dropped in i dropped in their

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,680
website and it gives us some overall

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,519
quick feedback the thing i like about

127
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
this is instead of just saying like hey

128
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
there's an insecure cooking cookie

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
setting this actually tells me why i

130
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
should be concerned or what's really

131
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,520
going on with it

132
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
and then even gives me links to the

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
proper cves i found this to be a very

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
helpful tool

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,520
in helping my brain step through like

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
hey i know that's bad but i can't

137
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
remember exactly why

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
right or thinking through that process

139
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
you can use the free tool all day long

140
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,919
and if you do all the sub pages it'll do

141
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
that the biggest advantage of the paid

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
version of it is it'll do an entire web

143
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
page index

144
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
and so that's a little more effective

145
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
um the other thing that a lot of folks

146
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
end up forgetting to check right out

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
there on the internet to be listed on

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
the internet for the most part there's

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
like an unlisted group but you have to

150
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
pretty much tell the

151
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
dns and internet providers of the world

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560
like this is the category of what my

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
website is right um so whether it's

154
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,880
banking or educational or games or

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
whatever those things are right with my

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
perfect i hate you this website example

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,479
right like

158
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
the coolmathgames.com is not even

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
pretending that it's not games right

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
they're just saying right out there hey

161
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,320
this is a gaming website

162
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
right and so

163
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
sometimes that helps you kind of get

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
appearance through that to really

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
understand what it is

166
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
on top of that lots of content filters

167
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,000
and firewalls and all kinds of things

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
look at these categorizations

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
so

170
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,759
oftentimes if you have a website you do

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
need to approve but it's getting blocked

172
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
or whatever that may be

173
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
sometimes that categorization can be

174
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
really helpful for you to

175
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
properly configure content filtering or

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
other things to allow it

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
google also has a really nifty tool

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
that's been

179
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,080
around for a really long time

180
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
it's one of those google beta projects

181
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
that never got super pretty on the front

182
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
but is just around there

183
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
what's kind of cool is that you know

184
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
they call it a

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
safe browsing check the number of things

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,560
and what this checks

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
um has been fairly um

188
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
has been fairly extensive

189
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,199
but it also changes from time to time um

190
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,800
the trickiest piece about this is you

191
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
just have to be able to read enough

192
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
basic html code to

193
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
insert within those quotation marks

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,680
your the website to do it

195
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,039
it's also kind of fun with a lot of

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
these tools to run it on your own

197
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,600
website

198
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
or your own company's website it's kind

199
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,360
of a good way to kind of test and think

200
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,319
through some of those processes

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
i do have some very specific things on

202
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
here and so after someone wants an email

203
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
they're shared or whatever i'm happy to

204
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,240
provide that because right now these

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
urls down fast enough is kind of tricky

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
another website that i actually learned

207
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
this one from the saintcon community

208
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
several years ago

209
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
but virustotal.com is also a really cool

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
free tool

211
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
a lot of the things that

212
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
in the security community we have a

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
tendency to use it for is like hash

214
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
checking in individual files to check

215
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,560
for virus or malware etc

216
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
something that for many years i didn't

217
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
realize they had until i got clicking

218
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
around and using it is they will also

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
check urls

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
and the cool part about these urls too

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
is you'll see it has a community based

222
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
score so when you check those or if

223
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
you're finding different things you can

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
flag your own report and that kind of

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
goes into the database to help the

226
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
greater community

227
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
be part of that evaluation

228
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
the other another thing you can look at

229
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,199
too is called urlvoid.com

230
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
the nice part about this is it gives you

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,280
a little bit more information about

232
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
um about what's going on with that url

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
right like

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
these cool math games people have

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
apparently had their website for 20

236
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,960
years so my vendetta is not working

237
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
right

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,720
um but it'll give you ip addresses it

239
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
even kind of gives you details about

240
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
server locations um so this can be

241
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
really useful the you know hey is this

242
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
website in russia or where is this

243
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
website right and these are just things

244
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
i can very quickly go through in my

245
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
process to

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,319
you know yes it's okay or no it's not

247
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,560
okay right not all these tools will

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
always give you a result on every single

249
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
thing but

250
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,479
um

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,200
you know the other thing is um

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
as poe built us the new phrase this

253
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,799
morning when we duck things

254
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,599
right um duckduckgo actually has a nifty

255
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,120
little um

256
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,279
privacy checker extension you can add to

257
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,560
your browser and that um throughout your

258
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,839
browsing

259
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
activity will give you like a grade in a

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
rating based on some security checks

261
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
that that website does

262
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
downside is is when you install it it

263
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,320
does access it it inserts itself as a

264
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
proxy in some method

265
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
and basically you agree to let it watch

266
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,760
everything you're doing

267
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
which is kind of the reverse of the

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
theoretical duckduckgo

269
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
thing but so i do like to use it on

270
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
occasion so i use it on a vm box i turn

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
it on i check it i turn it off

272
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
right um

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
because the whole idea of am i private

274
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
or not being checked but i have to give

275
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
you everything to know to be checked

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
just kind of call me tinfoil hat but

277
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
that's just it goes backwards in my head

278
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
um you know one of the other things that

279
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
is kind of this great mystical layer of

280
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
the internet is is ssl certificates and

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
how they work and if they're fresh and

282
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
what they're doing and

283
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,959
when

284
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,080
um

285
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
when they're expiring if they're working

286
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
etc

287
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
ssl labs runs um this free

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
um it's owned by qolsys but they run

289
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
this free site checker

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
site checker that you can drop it in on

291
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,399
they have lots of really cool really

292
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
expensive paid tools

293
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,800
um but the piece that's really useful

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
for me

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,519
when i just use the free stuff in

296
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
republic education so i very rarely

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
spend money on this premium stuff

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,959
but it gives us a quick check on do they

299
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,680
have certificates are they working

300
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
and just gives me a quick grade

301
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
um because i'm also that guy where like

302
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,480
i get the security of the certificate

303
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
concept and like i think it's cool but i

304
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
get very confused down in the weeds if i

305
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
think too far so straight letter grades

306
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,640
work really well for me

307
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
so

308
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
those are kind of some more of the basic

309
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
tools right um things that are pretty

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
easy to use there's some more

311
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
intermediate tools

312
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,079
that you know kind of like your duct

313
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,720
tape or you know the handyman's secret

314
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
weapon right is our hero red green calls

315
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,160
it

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
um

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
now this is kind of interesting

318
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
um because i've now just realized i

319
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,040
forgot to include the url here

320
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
so

321
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
checking the security certificate health

322
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,959
can tell you a whole bunch of

323
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
interesting things about what's going on

324
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
on the website

325
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
um now obviously as you can see there's

326
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,959
a little more of a technical output so

327
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
that's why i classified in the

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
intermediate group

329
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,519
but there's a couple things i could

330
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,440
learn about this website just from

331
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
running this checker

332
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,360
if we look at the first one right i can

333
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
see that they're actually

334
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,480
they're

335
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
using their security service certificate

336
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,680
and it lists that they're in greater

337
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
manchester okay so i actually now know

338
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,839
that they're in great britain right and

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,200
this tells me some more information

340
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
about them which is interesting because

341
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,959
their hosted ips

342
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,880
are all us-based they're publicly listed

343
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
ones

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
so this gave me an additional piece of

345
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
information that i didn't have about

346
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
them

347
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
one of the other things that's become

348
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
very popular that at least for me i feel

349
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,519
like it's a potential vulnerability but

350
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,040
there's a company out there now that's

351
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
called let's encrypt and they do

352
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
security certificates for free

353
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
and so lots of people use them

354
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,040
however they are only good for 90 days

355
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
and so if you were theoretically wanting

356
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
to try to camp on a website or

357
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,959
potentially pick up their certificate or

358
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
do something like that it's publicly

359
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
listed right there

360
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
when it expires and when it started

361
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,560
right so if we look at the first one

362
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
right we can see that on 919 they set it

363
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
up right and then it expires on 12 18.

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,439
right so

365
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
interpret the usage of a website how you

366
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
will or how you want to in terms of like

367
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
if they're too cheap to buy a security

368
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
certificate should i be considering that

369
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,399
or not

370
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,680
i don't know if that's cheap it could

371
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
just be cost savings but even in public

372
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
education where i don't have any budget

373
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,079
i don't have the emotional strength to

374
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,600
change the security certificate on every

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
device every three months

376
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
it would not make my life easy enough um

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
you know the other thing that kind of

378
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,279
comes up

379
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,839
um is like okay like that was super high

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
level you're cool and everything but

381
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
like i wanted a lot more detail and want

382
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
to get way more in to looking at this

383
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,120
stuff um so probably the most

384
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
popular tool out there is called burp

385
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
suite

386
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,760
that's not a spelling error that's

387
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
exactly how it goes

388
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
there is

389
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,079
a paid version of burp suite that does a

390
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,800
whole bunch of cool stuff there's also a

391
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
community edition of burp suite

392
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
which is free

393
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,320
true story when people were at i went to

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
the discord saint kong community and

395
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
said hey i'm trying to develop a process

396
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
on how to better check websites and see

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,839
if they're secure or not

398
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
you know what should i be using and

399
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
everybody went

400
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,199
but i'm like okay well

401
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,560
i looked at it it's a little bit

402
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,920
complicated but

403
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
sure put me down to present on burp

404
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
suite and so

405
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
that's how i decided i was going to have

406
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
to learn burp suite because i had four

407
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
months and i was going to learn burp

408
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
suites so i could present to you folks

409
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
on it and um

410
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
turns out that was way more complicated

411
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,639
than i wanted to deal with

412
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
so i actually kind of backed up a little

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,360
bit and said actually i want to talk

414
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,560
about tools that are a little softer um

415
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
a big piece of this though which kind of

416
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,519
took me through the first month of

417
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
trying to figure it out the way burp

418
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
suite works is again this is another

419
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
proxy that sticks itself right in the

420
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
middle of your activity now you can run

421
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
a dedicated browser in it so that it's

422
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
not watching everything else

423
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
but if you have a good corporate secured

424
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,079
network it should not like this tool

425
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,279
right

426
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
if you've got good security practices in

427
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,920
place you're going to be paying

428
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
attention to if your users are running

429
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
proxies and doing things like that

430
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
my antivirus tool didn't really like

431
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,600
burp my content filter didn't like burp

432
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
my firewall didn't like burp but by time

433
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,639
i got it all straightened out

434
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
then it was pretty cool but then it was

435
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,320
like okay now i have it working and how

436
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
the heck do i

437
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
actually use it um so this particular

438
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
guy on youtube has a really good

439
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,160
introductory series on like hey this is

440
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
how to use burp

441
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
if you go to youtube there's thousands

442
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
of folks showing you how to use burp um

443
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
even burps community puts out one that

444
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
is

445
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
uh

446
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
super dry like our

447
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,519
like our drought season this year um so

448
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
this guy actually had some level of

449
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
personality um so i found it to be most

450
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,920
useful

451
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
in the community edition it really is

452
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
very user driven

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
so you have to go and hey i want to

454
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,639
check this thing and then i want to

455
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,199
check this thing and then this thing so

456
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
you kind of have to know what you want

457
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
to use it for what you want to do

458
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
in terms of

459
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,240
the professional tool if you pay for it

460
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
then you can kind of build automated

461
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
tasks and it will go and do that

462
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,839
but as a general rule that's kind of

463
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,680
that's kind of some of the overall tools

464
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
that i use

465
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
and then some warnings about some cooler

466
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
tools but

467
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
that's kind of what i've got for you

468
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,959
questions comments emotional outbursts

469
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
um it wasn't let me actually just

470
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
oh you know what i'm using a borrowed

471
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,279
laptop let me uh it's in the sink on

472
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,639
discord in the security briefings from

473
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
last week

474
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,199
actually

475
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
um

476
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
yeah um

477
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
if you hit me after i can get it to you

478
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
i uh because that was actually super

479
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
nifty too i didn't actually know about

480
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,519
until

481
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,880
last week and then i was looking at it

482
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
and i'm like oh whoa this is really cool

483
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
right but that's one of the advantages

484
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
of like the cenkon community and things

485
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
like that it came up in the discord and

486
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
i was like wow this is this is great

487
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
all right well thanks everybody i

488
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
appreciate it and have a good con
