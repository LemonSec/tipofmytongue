1
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
right now we have six different high

2
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
schools if they want to take linux and

3
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
cyber they log into my webex i'm

4
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
physically at american fork

5
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
but they can take the linux and the

6
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
webex

7
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
and then the next year they could take a

8
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
plus we actually like them to start with

9
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
the a plus first

10
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,720
and then go to the linux i kind of like

11
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
them to have hands on their computers

12
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,039
first

13
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
and then they can come join the class

14
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
and we go around on field trips

15
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
and security metrics out there has

16
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
hosted us every year until covet hit and

17
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
they let the kids come down and we and

18
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
talk to them and we just do these little

19
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
quick two two three hour field trips on

20
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,199
fridays to go out and look at businesses

21
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
and find out what they're doing and

22
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280

each team can go up to six people

36
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840

38
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120

get from the armed forces to like fro

70
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,080

71
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,839
to challenge yourself to have the coin

72
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
with you at all times and

73
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
i i actually have a few of them usually

74
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
sometimes but not today

75
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,600
but

76
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
they're kind of cool the armed forces

77
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
give them out my dad has

78
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
three i think

79
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
you just challenge yourself to keep them

80
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
with you at all times and

81
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,959
it's kind of cool

82
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,839
so they get challenge coins for their

83
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,720
participation and

84
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
it's it's kind of a

85
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,399
a really really cool thing that the air

86
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,760
force does

87
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,959
with those challenge coins

88
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,839
this is what our competition looks like

89
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
in our classroom

90
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,399
this was uh

91
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
we i like to spoil the students they

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,399
think i do too much i go a little

93
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
overboard perhaps

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
i do go a little overboard yeah they're

95
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,519
they're all

96
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
yeah just a little bit

97
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
i look i look for fun swag at any of the

98
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
conferences that i go to and try to put

99
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
swag bags together for them when they're

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
coming in

101
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
and i try to get as much food as they

102
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
could possibly eat and drink and

103
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
i hope i don't make them sick

104
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
but it's it's six hours so we come into

105
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
this classroom here they have

106
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
three images during the regular

107
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
challenges and four images during the

108
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,760
state challenge that they have to

109
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,320
download that's usually a windows

110
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,680
windows 10

111
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
we've had everything from windows xp to

112
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
windows 7 to

113
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
xp is as low as they've gone honestly

114
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
you don't know what image you're getting

115
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,079
and that you're going to have to do the

116
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
administration on then they'll do a

117
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
windows server and that could be

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
anything from server

119
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
2008 to 20 to 2019

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
you just don't know which one you're

121
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
getting

122
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
when you get in there and then they have

123
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
an ubuntu image on state there's usually

124
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
two linux images

125
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
then you also

126
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
get to

127
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
do

128
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
packet tracer with cisco and you have a

129
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
problem that you're going to be solving

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,079
with packet tracer and uploading it and

131
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
then they have a networking quiz of

132
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
about 30 questions that they go through

133
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
all of these are added together for

134
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,120
points

135
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
and you score against other teams within

136
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,079
your state and then you go for ranking

137
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,120
the top 13 teams nationally get to go

138
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
back to maryland

139
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,160
and compete or is it boston

140
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
maryland i got it right yeah back to

141
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
maryland and compete last year they had

142
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,640
to do it virtually

143
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,440
so so this is just having kind of

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
showing you what the competition does we

145
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160

so this is the badge that you got this

150
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320

i-team we've been working with is

153
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
you can do it which is the cyber

154
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,720
security hardware but we they also have

155
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
gaming on that section where they can do

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
some gaming or

157
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920

we

162
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
we like to do

163
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
what's called

164
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,880

use discord to be able to chat back and

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
like a thing that i can geek out with

265
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759

268
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
my i've been to saint kahn like i've

269
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,399
been in real life saying khan once but

270
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
i've been to sync on twice i went to the

271
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
virtual one last year

272
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
my favorite thing about saint con is

273
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,360
actually the hacker challenge i always

274
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
thought that was really fun getting with

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
a small team and just trying to get as

276
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,440
many points as possible and honestly

277
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,519
that was my favorite part about st khan

278
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
and uh my favorite part about cyborg

279
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
patriots is that i get to get together

280
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
with a team and make new friends and

281
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
also

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
i do some do some challenges with them

283
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,279
and

284
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,320
also figure out what uh figure out

285
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,959
the forensic questions as he said and

286
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
like figure out a bunch of things i've

287
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
learned so much from cyber patriots and

288
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,560
also learned a lot from saint kahn

289
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,720
hi my name is amelia lebaron this is my

290
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
third year at st con and my second year

291
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
doing cyber patriots

292
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
i have to say that my favorite thing at

293
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,040
st khan has to be soldering my the first

294
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
year i was here i spent

295
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
a lot of time at the soldering table

296
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
because i'd never seen it before i

297
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
somehow had missed out on this awesome

298
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
opportunity my whole life and

299
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
immediately became obsessed and i'm i'm

300
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,519
still obsessed to be honest my favorite

301
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
thing about cyber patriots

302
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,480
is

303
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
being able to spend six hours working

304
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
together to solve a problem with the

305
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,919
team

306
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,959
there's nothing really like it and it's

307
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
it's very satisfying but also very

308
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,599
fulfilling

309
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
once you

310
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
finally rack up some points

311
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
one of the best oh yeah let's give them

312
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,300
a hand of flops

313
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,880
[Applause]

314
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
one of the best things about cyber

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
patriots is

316
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
it was golden when we got our first

317
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
points the first year we didn't have a

318
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
clue what we were doing we were just

319
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
like sitting in there going okay i think

320
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
this is what we do

321
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
as coaches we'd watch the videos and we

322
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,960
weren't very good and finally something

323
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
went ding ding ding ding and we went i

324
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
think we got points

325
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,679
so a little alarm goes off and it's

326
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
really awesome and then you you get the

327
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
points what's really bad is when the

328
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
foghorn goes off and scares you to death

329
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,679
and that's when your points are going

330
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
backwards because you unsecured the

331
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
machine

332
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
that you were you were looking at and

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
it's uh it's kind of crazy

334
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
that's uh i kind of wanted the rest of

335
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,320
my high school students if you're in

336
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,080
here and if you're a teacher stand up

337
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
and wave to the crowd come stand up guys

338
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720

him right there in the back corner on

students in the hall take time to say hi

350
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,080
