1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,399
um if for those of you who have no idea

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
who i am i am jupiter

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,520
uh my name in real life is troy jessup i

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,960
work for the utah education and

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,719
telehealth network

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,200
uh and have been there for over 20 years

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
doing all sorts of different things but

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,400
for about the last 12 to 14 years of

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,840
that it's been cyber security focused

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
and we were doing cyber security before

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
it was cool

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,279
up there

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
and so this presentation today is uh

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,439
just

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
as you can imagine as we do a lot of

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,040
sync con planning

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
i get involved in a lot of different

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
things and so one of the things that

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
comes last on the list

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,399
is getting my presentations prepared so

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
we make sure everything else is running

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,960
smooth and then

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
we get to presentations and other things

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,039
so

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,160
here's a disclaimer for this

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
presentation if none of this works out

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
for you you're welcome to find a better

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
and more interesting talk than this

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
despite any preconceptions

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
i am a social introvert

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,438
i've added myself like that before but

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960
for those of you that might be new

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
that's me i i'm a geek i like dark

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
quiet places with techno music playing

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
in the background

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,799
and just typing on a keyboard like

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
probably most of you do

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
i'm also riddled with this condition

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
called add

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
i mean it's not super bad but it's

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
terrible at the same time and so what i

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
do is my focus goes with the wind

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
and things and so we're going to be on

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
topic a little and then off topic a

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,439
whole lot i'm sure during this

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,200
presentation

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
one other thing again uh despite any

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
preconceptions i'm way outside my

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,200
element and i've never in my life

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,799
enjoyed presenting

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,680
um

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
i i do it because

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
and and this is probably something

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,360
that'll be it'll warm your your your

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
precious heart

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
i do it because i understand how

57
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
important the topic of cyber security is

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
and maybe this will be the first

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
diversion this is add coming right right

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
live for you

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
but the first aversion is that

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
for those how many of you have been to

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
the utah saints

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
security saintcon security summit things

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
since the very beginning anybody that's

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
been here for a long time okay we've got

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,760
jared over here

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
there's so much light i can't see

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
everybody but

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
there's there's some hands here

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,959
so this is for better or for worse the

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
20th

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
security conference that we've done now

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
it's been called different things

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,040
so story time maybe for a minute we'll

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
we'll diverge i'll use the time we'll

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
burn it

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
so story time is about 20 years ago

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
we started something called a security

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
summit and the reason why we did that is

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
in my job at the utah education and

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
telehealth network i saw that certain

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
entities around the state

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
that we were sort of responsible for

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
providing connectivity and other things

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,319
too

87
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
were doing

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
not so great jobs with cyber security

89
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,640
now again 20 years ago a lot has changed

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
in 20 years but we're back when we

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
talked 20 years ago we're talking back

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
in the days where a firewall was still

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
kind of an optional thing to have

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,840
on your network for for most people i

95
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
mean if you think about it that's not

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
that long ago but that's how far we've

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
come in 20 years

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,239
and so one of these things is i go and i

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,560
get the pants scared off of me

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,319
uh at some conference i don't even

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,519
remember what it was it wasn't like

102
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
defcon or anything it was some other

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
thing that we went to and we talked

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
about cyber security and i was mostly

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
doing i.t stuff at the time at uetn

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
and i came back and i'm like oh man

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
we are in a we're in bad shape in the

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
state of utah and so i threw this

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
conference together

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
and we called it the security summit and

111
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
it was kind of a an internal to our

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
customers or our connected entities with

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
the utah education network

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,879
and we invited them to come up and there

115
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
was probably about 25 of us in the room

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,519
and for those of you that were there

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
during that one we did it at the eccles

118
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
broadcast center in the dumb key

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
conference room we just kind of shoved

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
the chairs in there and took over the

121
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
projector and we talked about security

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,918
for just a couple of days

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,798
and

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,320
it was the first opera or the first

125
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
point where i'm doing 20 hours of

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
presentations and talking about all the

127
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
things that i had learned

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
about cyber security some of these

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
recent conferences and other things now

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,600
i've been

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
doing hackery things for my entire life

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
if you want to hear about that i did a

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
sort of closing keynote i think it was

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
last year or the year before it's on

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
youtube you can hear all about my

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,080
growing up and all the the nefarious and

137
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
miscreant things that i used to do

138
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
so i was interested in this cyber

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
security stuff and i was there to help

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
evangelize it for these organizations

141
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
and institutions around the state so

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
that's where it started so it's 20 years

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
ago it was called the security summit

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,199
but then what we found

145
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
uh and we're not even past the

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
disclaimer slide sorry we'll get through

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
a few more here in a minute

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
but then what we found was that

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
there was this community

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
around wanting to learn and do something

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
better about this stuff and so it didn't

152
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
take us very long

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
back in 2000 and i want to say four or

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
five we created the utah saint

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
organization and it wasn't like anything

156
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
official back then we just thought

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
that utah saint sounded cool because

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,720
saint was an acronym for a security

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
advisory and incident network team

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
and we were the utah version of it not

161
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
that it was anywhere else but utah you

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
know and so we called ourselves the utah

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
saint organization it was really just

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,800
an email list and a couple places where

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,440
we could be on irc and chat with each

166
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
other and tell war stories and get each

167
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,160
other's help and things

168
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
and then we started calling these

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
get-togethers that we did annually the

170
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
utah saint conference and we did many of

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
those for many years so many other

172
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,560
people in the room

173
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,319
would remember when we did it in

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,199
richfield we've done it in heber city

175
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
we've done it in

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
northern utah we've done it in st george

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,800
in fact we did it in st george we loved

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,039
st jars during october

179
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,960
it's nice and warm still

180
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
beautiful weather

181
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
and such down there and but we only ever

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
allowed about 150 people

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,319
at that conference and it was still kind

184
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
of a close-knit group it was just our

185
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
community and we'd get together we'd

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
have all sorts of fun

187
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
all week long

188
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
and

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,440
we called the utah st conference and it

190
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
wasn't until about 2015 that we decided

191
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,080
that

192
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
we kind of were holding back from

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
allowing other people to join our

194
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
community and be involved and so we

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
rebranded it the saint khan conference

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
uh as kind of an homage to

197
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,039
our saint

198
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
acronym roots that's what it stands for

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
i i kind of ingest always say we're not

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
a conference about a being a bunch of

201
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
conceited mormons we're

202
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
a security group

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,840
uh and so saint is that acronym the

204
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
security advisor and his network team

205
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
um and so we called the st khan ever

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
since so that's your brief history can

207
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
we get past the disclaimer good question

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,400
though

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
that was a good add thing too

210
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,880
uh and as you can see the next part of

211
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,240
our slide here there will be random

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,479
stories like that and discussions i have

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
truly not very not prepared uh much for

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
this presentation now when i wrote this

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
slide there wasn't anything prepared but

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,919
i've since put a few things in you know

217
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
add being what it is

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,599
so set your expectations low and we're

219
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
going to do just fine

220
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,319
so the first thing i want to talk about

221
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,120
today is toilet

222
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,520
paper um so it's one of those things in

223
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,479
life

224
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
uh that you need

225
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,400
and uh to for those of you that know who

226
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
kelly guinness he is

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,039
okay

228
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,800
he is affectionately known as chunk for

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
those of you that don't there's plenty

230
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
of youtube videos about kelly uh in the

231
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
saintcon archive but he made a quote

232
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,759
once that says

233
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
toilet paper we ought to use it

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
and he's not wrong right it's it's one

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,639
of those things that we should use well

236
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,400
so this is going to be kind of a really

237
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,879
just unprofessional dumb presentation

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,360
where we're going to apply toilet paper

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,039
and duty and other things to our

240
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
security world as long as everybody's

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
okay with that

242
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
that's great if you're not

243
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
you can find another presentation i

244
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
won't be offended

245
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,919
so

246
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,479
the things that we should just use

247
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
and have available to us that i wanted

248
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,919
to talk about this is something that

249
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
i've evangelized for many years and so

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
this might be a little bit repetitive to

251
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,200
some

252
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
but do you use a security framework

253
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
within your organization or your area of

254
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
influence

255
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
and are you familiar with what a

256
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
security framework is i don't have a

257
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
slide for any more than that

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,360
but just to say that if you don't have

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
something that you can use to measure

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,440
your progress in security against over

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
time

262
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
you're probably not going to make a lot

263
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
of progress or you're going to expend

264
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
effort in areas that's not super

265
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
effective for what you're trying to

266
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
accomplish and so there's tons of

267
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,120
different frameworks out there some of

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
them will be familiar if i were to say

269
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
like the uh

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
the sans critical security controls

271
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,399
framework that one might be or it's

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,040
called the cis the center for internet

273
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
security critical controls framework

274
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
uh or how about the sp 800 or the iso

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
27001 these are all frameworks that can

276
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,680
be used to

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
gauge and and have you do some

278
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
self-assessment and other things to

279
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,519
figure out where you are and where you

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,040
should be focusing because most of them

281
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
prioritize

282
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
how you should be doing things and so

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
it's like toilet paper we ought to use

284
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,480
it they're out there they're free to use

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
they're easy to find

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
they're a pain in the butt

287
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
figuratively

288
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
uh to implement some of the time

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
one of the other things that i thought i

290
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,880
would refer in my toilet paper part of

291
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
this the presentation here is

292
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
vulnerabilities how do you manage your

293
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
vulnerabilities anybody got the the

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
golden bullet or the silver bullet for

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,279
how you do that anyone

296
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
one device at a time okay that's a

297
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
that's a great response because

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
sometimes you just have to do it like

299
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,399
that but who thinks that they don't do a

300
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,120
great job of vulnerability management

301
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
okay that's fair how many of you think

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
that you do a good job of vulnerability

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
management

304
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
okay not a single hand goes up which

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,120
isn't surprising

306
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,680
what is the worst thing you have to do

307
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
generally as a security administrator

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
security analyst

309
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,200
seems like you're always playing

310
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
whack-a-mole with vulnerability

311
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
management right

312
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
how many of you still have i mean if we

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
were to go and just do a scan a

314
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,399
vulnerability scan on your network have

315
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,640
critical level five vulnerabilities now

316
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
hope before you raise your hand i do

317
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
want to see hands but

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,839
if you're okay with disclosing that

319
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
information raise your hand okay one or

320
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
two of you out there right and the rest

321
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
of you we know that you should have

322
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
raised your hand most likely that you've

323
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,279
got level 5 vulnerabilities out there

324
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,279
again we're using the like a nessa scale

325
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,800
or koala scale

326
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
and things the thing is is it's hard

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
and so one of the things that we need to

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
make sure that we're doing as security

329
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
uh professionals

330
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
is using the toilet paper of

331
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
vulnerability management

332
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
okay i don't have any specific

333
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,279
suggestions on how you do that but i

334
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
wanted to make sure that that's one of

335
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
the things that i talked about because

336
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
it's super

337
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
important in maintaining and managing

338
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,160
risk within your organizations

339
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
so that kind of goes along with how are

340
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
you managing your patching process how

341
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
many have a great patch management

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
process

343
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
okay i'd love to hear about it i'm not

344
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
going to make you

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
talk about it but if you've got a really

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
cool way that you're managing patches

347
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,839
within your organization

348
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
that's awesome we all struggle with this

349
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
type of thing even at the great and

350
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
illustrious uetn

351
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
we suck at being able to

352
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,639
effectively keep everything patched the

353
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
way that it needs to be patched and we

354
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
could play or we could use all of our

355
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,959
time all day every day just managing

356
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,079
patches

357
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
if we had to or if we could right

358
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
uh and so

359
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
how do you manage your patches it's one

360
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,120
of those things that we i wanted to

361
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
bring up as this is important this is

362
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
like toilet paper we ought to do it we

363
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
ought to use it okay

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
and then i figured i'd throw up a comic

365
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
relief slide at this point

366
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
um you know this is a bathroom and a

367
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
home office so it's it yeah never mind

368
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,000
didn't go over well no laughs not a

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
single one

370
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,959
okay so next we're going to talk about

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,000
some of the

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
more

373
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,399
interesting parts of cyber security um

374
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
do you have in your organizations enough

375
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
visibility

376
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
what is that i mean hopefully that sinks

377
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,040
in for a second i'll pause for dramatic

378
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,079
effect

379
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
do you have the visibility to see

380
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
or if you were breached would you even

381
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
know

382
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,360
how many of you guys are confident to

383
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
say hey you know what we've got pretty

384
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
much everything covered

385
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
if there was a breach i'd know about it

386
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,399
okay and how many are in the other camp

387
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,320
if we had a breach there's not a there

388
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,760
could be ways that we don't know about

389
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
it right

390
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
visibility is one of the hardest things

391
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
to achieve but it's one of the most

392
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
important things that we as security

393
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,120
professionals need to be focused on is

394
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,639
finding ways

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,720
to ingest more data

396
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
more logs more information

397
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
it's like big brother we want it all

398
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
and then we parse through it and we come

399
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
up with meaningful alerts and and

400
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
notifications and things to figure out

401
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
whether or not we've been breached or

402
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
give us signs or at least some

403
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,120
indication

404
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
if we've been breached inter-threat

405
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
hunting there's not a slide for threat

406
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,160
hunting

407
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
but

408
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
how often have you guys heard that term

409
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
how many of you guys are threat hunters

410
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
guys or gals sorry i do not mean to be

411
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
exclusive okay so threat hunting there's

412
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
one or two of you that raised your hands

413
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,440
kind of like this

414
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
threat hunting

415
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
it's kind of an interesting thing that

416
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
when we see alerts and see things happen

417
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
they're not necessarily always

418
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
indicators of compromise or breach we

419
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
ingest a ton of data but what do we have

420
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,160
to do with it

421
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
we have to analyze it we have to kind of

422
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,440
follow the water and see where it goes

423
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
uh and things and so

424
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
uh one of uh threat hunting needs to

425
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
become part of what we're doing on a

426
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
more regular basis to security

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
professionals if you're not doing that

428
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
already now i'm saying i'm bringing all

429
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,040
this to you from a very elementary or

430
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
fundamental sort of way

431
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
specifically for the folks that i know

432
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
need some of this more fundamental types

433
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
thing type are these fundamental types

434
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
of of information and how to get started

435
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
in cyber security and things but some of

436
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
you probably have very mature

437
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
implementations of

438
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,079
log management

439
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
else you know a fully functional sim

440
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
where you're ingesting all of your web

441
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,240
logs and all of your syslogs active

442
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
directory logs and everything

443
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
and and figuring it out so i'll ask one

444
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
more question before i move on from

445
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,560
there but how many of you if somebody

446
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
logged in with an admin credential

447
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,279
on your active directory again i'm

448
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
assuming active directory here and it

449
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
happened at two o'clock in the morning

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
how quickly would you know that that

451
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
happened

452
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
did anybody have a short time frame

453
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,759
you get an immediate email so you're

454
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,839
awake at that time and you're reading

455
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
your emails

456
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,839
okay standard geek stuff i i'm with you

457
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
there i understand that i i respond to

458
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
emails at two in the morning sometimes

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
instantly i heard over here as well how

460
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
many of you of you again not necessarily

461
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
to raise your hand but how many of you

462
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,600
wouldn't know

463
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
if somebody logged in with a domain

464
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
admin credential or some sort of other

465
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
administrative credential at two o'clock

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
in the morning within your organization

467
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,160
that you don't get a text or an email or

468
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
anything

469
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
these are the most common types of

470
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
things that are easy to implement that

471
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,440
make it easy for us as security

472
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
professionals to start understanding

473
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
what's going on on our network

474
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
i would say it should be reasonable as a

475
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
security professional to get a page at

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
two o'clock in the morning if somebody

477
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
uses an admin credential on your network

478
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,560
unless of course your 24 7 shop and you

479
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
know caveats and other things apply

480
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,959
what i wanted to illustrate with this

481
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
slide is you just don't want to slide

482
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,839
into the

483
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
crap as it were

484
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,360
and i don't even know why i put that

485
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
slide in there

486
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
getting paid to poop

487
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
um you know as security professionals we

488
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,600
deal with a lot of crap

489
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
what are the people that get blamed when

490
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,959
the firewall doesn't let their packets

491
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
through it's those darn security guys

492
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,119
it's those darn security guys that make

493
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
it hard for me to go and buy a product

494
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
because it hasn't been fully vetted and

495
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,240
we don't know how it works within our

496
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,959
organization or our enterprise

497
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,480
we deal with it

498
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
you need to just be okay with it here's

499
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,359
elmo he's cool he's getting paid to deal

500
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,039
with this stuff

501
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,359
and and sometimes it's not a glamorous

502
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
job most people think that being a

503
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
security professional is all glamour and

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,400
sexy

505
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
uh that it's the cool thing oh man you

506
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
get a hack for a living that's amazing

507
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
but what what you find out for those of

508
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
you that aren't in the security industry

509
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
yet you get there and it's 90

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,039
crap

511
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
and 10

512
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
cool and interesting and sexy as it were

513
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
and so anyways that's what that slide's

514
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,679
all about anyways i want to talk about

515
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
order of operations

516
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,039
as well and i don't know why i put this

517
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
in here honestly it's again one of those

518
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
weird slides

519
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,320
but

520
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,799
you got a fan and you can blow things

521
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,640
one way or the other but you don't want

522
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
to necessarily

523
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,720
put the fan before or you know so

524
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
yeah

525
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
the order of operations here is we need

526
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,600
to be the fan moving the crap along

527
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
doing what we need to be doing because

528
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
otherwise what's going to happen is the

529
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
crap is going to come into the fan and

530
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
that's never a good

531
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
good good time okay so fun slide right

532
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
okay and then there's this one

533
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
how many of you feel like this

534
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,760
i'm going to let it go for a second

535
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
maybe you'll understand what's going on

536
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
here

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
but this is a legitimate service

538
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,399
in arizona

539
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,520
where a guy will come and paint your

540
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
lawn green

541
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
uh and so when i saw this i thought oh

542
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,120
man this this has so many parallels with

543
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,280
cyber security and stuff that sometimes

544
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
we feel like we're just painting the

545
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
lawn green it's brown it's ugly it's

546
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
crappy it doesn't you know it's a pain

547
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,240
in the butt to deal with

548
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
and such

549
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
but

550
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,559
we feel like we're just painting it over

551
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
with green paint anyways he does a

552
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
really good job though i mean look at

553
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,720
this attention to detail and the corners

554
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
and

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,799
and

556
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
all this randomness

557
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
okay i told you this was going to be a

558
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
stupid stupid presentation you were

559
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
warned okay and then there's the

560
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,640
squirrel slide so we're going to talk

561
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
about something different for a minute

562
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
um so let's talk about some really cool

563
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
stuff that that we've been working on or

564
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
looking at recently so

565
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,000
i see nate over here i'm going to point

566
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,679
him out because he's the one that found

567
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
this originally

568
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
we at uetn have an opportunity from time

569
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,240
to time to look at a lot of data there's

570
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
a lot of data coming in and out of our

571
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,480
network and when we see some odd things

572
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
we have the ability we don't do it all

573
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
the time i want to make sure that's

574
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
clear but we have the ability to like

575
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
dig in and look deeper into some data

576
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
when it shows up as anomalous and things

577
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
and we've been seeing some interesting

578
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,760
things and so this is going to be super

579
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
hard for most of you anywhere past like

580
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,039
the second or third row to look at but

581
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
we're starting to see this interesting

582
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,240
new trend

583
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
out there

584
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
and if you and what i'll do is i'll

585
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
explain to you what you're seeing here

586
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
if you look at this this is source and

587
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
destination traffic that looks

588
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,679
just like a full-fledged smtp chatter

589
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,559
okay so this happens on port 25

590
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,760
the host on a specific network creates a

591
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,120
connection outbound on port 25 and it

592
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
just makes it look like hey i'm sending

593
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,240
email

594
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
i'm chattering back and forth on port

595
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
25.

596
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
it's using and and what you'll see here

597
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
is on the destination side

598
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
all of the proper responses and it's

599
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,799
hard for me to highlight because it's

600
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,760
not

601
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,600
text that i can highlight but

602
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
in that first section where you see

603
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,520
um

604
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
or sorry on the destination second

605
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,840
section down it's showing all of the

606
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,720
hey

607
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,679
glad to meet you uh i'm happy to to take

608
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,880
your smtp chatter uh here's the size of

609
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
the email i'm going to be sending here's

610
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,960
all this information and everything else

611
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,760
and it allows the sender

612
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
over here to start sending data now it

613
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
looks exactly

614
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
like

615
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
standard smt smtp chatter

616
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
that we would expect to see but what

617
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,840
this is is this is data exfiltration

618
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
going on

619
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,880
and it's

620
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
really super crazy and interesting

621
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
because it's doing full firewall evasion

622
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
because we've got these really cool

623
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
firewalls nowadays most of you probably

624
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
have something called the next-gen

625
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,960
firewall we call them that right because

626
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
they have the ability to not just block

627
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
a port

628
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,080
or a specific protocol or something like

629
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
that but it can actually look into the

630
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
packet and it'll see

631
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,400
hey if it's on port 25 it should be smtp

632
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,520
traffic is it and if it matches some of

633
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,080
those signatures for hey is this smtp

634
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
traffic yes it is okay let it through

635
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
that's what we expect to see

636
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
well now what we're seeing is deep

637
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,679
embeddedness of data exfiltration

638
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,400
over something like an smtp port

639
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,679
but

640
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,000
it doesn't end there because from a

641
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
similar host or maybe if this is even

642
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,360
the same host nate would have to fill us

643
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
in on that

644
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
because he sent me the screenshots and i

645
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,360
appreciate him him doing this but this

646
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
is the exact same thing going on where

647
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,480
data exfiltration begins to happen over

648
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,960
a pretend or simulated

649
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080
ftp session

650
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,240
now we're also seeing the same thing

651
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
with http

652
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
and secureweb and many other protocols

653
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,840
around there and so we're seeing now

654
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,320
botnets and other malicious software

655
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
that's embedding themselves into

656
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,559
organizations and networks and starting

657
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,840
to look exactly like and it's not just

658
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
the headers and things anymore that we

659
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
were used to seeing and that the

660
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
firewalls do scrutiny i mean what they

661
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
generally do is they look and say hey

662
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
okay i'm seeing ftp chatter in there but

663
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,240
there's a certain point where the

664
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
firewall just marks it as good and says

665
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,320
go ahead

666
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
and what we're seeing now is that the

667
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,120
exploitation the amount of programming

668
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,760
and chatter that's going back and forth

669
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
to enable these types of connections to

670
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,080
flow through your firewalls are now

671
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
occurring on a regular basis now the

672
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
interesting thing about this

673
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
is we're seeing this now propagate

674
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,840
into vpn services as well

675
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,960
so you've got vpns and other things that

676
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
are on your networks that are actually

677
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
sending this exact type of data and this

678
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
is how they're getting past your

679
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
firewalls and things

680
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
there's several vpn companies out there

681
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
that are involved in this type of

682
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,120
firewall evasion things now and

683
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
ironically enough they're some of the

684
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,279
primary developers of the technology and

685
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
libraries that are doing this

686
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
it's coming out of the need or the

687
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,919
necessity to have firewall evasion for

688
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,320
vpn traffic and the miscreants are now

689
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
taking it and doing data exfiltration

690
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,720
and other things so vpn services are

691
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,799
working that way as well

692
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,320
that's all you get for that piece of

693
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
slide

694
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
this is not my real grandpa but i'm

695
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
going to tell you a story that might

696
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,760
relate to some of the things i was

697
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
talking about earlier again follow my

698
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,320
80d it's not going to be easy

699
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
so one of the things and i've recounted

700
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
this at st con before but it bears

701
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,799
repeating

702
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,840
um

703
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,000
i grew up first of all in a very small

704
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
town town was called gun lock anybody

705
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
know where gun lock is

706
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
few of you awesome most of you are

707
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
southern utah folks i grew up in a

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,679
little tiny town called gun lock

709
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,679
probably has 150 people

710
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,120
total

711
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
farming community and i grew up in a

712
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
community where computers weren't really

713
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,640
a big thing and going and changing hand

714
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,520
line for sprinklers and

715
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
fields and ranch work was kind of the

716
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,000
norm so i come from

717
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,279
solid utah roots as you call them around

718
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
here

719
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,799
but there's one one lesson that i

720
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,679
learned on the farm

721
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,120
that i relate all of the time to

722
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
cyber security and it's a lesson that i

723
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,480
learned and that i hope it gives you

724
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
just a little nugget of help and things

725
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
for you but there was one time comes

726
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
along with this this recommendation or

727
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
the story goes is a story

728
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,520
one time

729
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
i was sitting uh at the edge of a field

730
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,679
uh

731
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,200
where we were supposed to change hand

732
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
line if any of you done hand line

733
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
sprinklers this is the one where you

734
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
carry those sprinklers that are about 40

735
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,440
feet long

736
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,720
they're made of aluminum so they're

737
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
light

738
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
but you have to go and pick them up off

739
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,159
the ground and haul them the

740
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,320
50 feet that you need and put them back

741
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,159
together and the water comes through and

742
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,679
it sprinkles the the alfalfa or whatever

743
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,960
we're sitting on the edge of a field and

744
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,720
it was me my brother and a couple of my

745
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
cousins hanging out in this field and it

746
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
was our job to change hand line but my

747
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
grandpa was sitting on the edge of the

748
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,480
field

749
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,159
and his grandpa's do he has a shovel

750
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,679
with him

751
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,440
it wasn't like this in the picture he

752
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
was just leaning on it

753
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,400
how many of you have leaned on a shovel

754
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
before

755
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,919
it's kind of nice right especially when

756
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,760
you're in that supervisory position and

757
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,679
i'm sure my grandpa

758
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,440
thought that he was being very much the

759
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,240
supervisor and was

760
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
but one of the the most interesting

761
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
thing happened uh during that experience

762
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
is i was standing there with him kind of

763
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
watching my cousins i was tired of doing

764
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
hand line sprinklers that day and didn't

765
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,799
really want to do much he said he said

766
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,960
something like hey don't just stand

767
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,760
there

768
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
do something

769
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
and hit that was his way of saying hey

770
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
go out and

771
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,279
get something done he says it doesn't

772
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,679
matter what it is jump up and down turn

773
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
around like just do something

774
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
and what i took to heart of that and it

775
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,520
took a little while because i was mad at

776
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,960
grandpa because he wouldn't ever let us

777
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
rest he was the task master

778
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,039
but what i took from that is that

779
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
it's a mindset thing and i'll kind of

780
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
refer back to what we heard in our

781
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
keynotes yesterday

782
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
mindset security is not always glamorous

783
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
it's not always fun it's not always

784
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,279
interesting

785
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
it's sometimes hard

786
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,240
you have to pick up the hand line you

787
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
have to move it 50 feet and then you got

788
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
to do it again 500 times to change the

789
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,520
sprinklers on that field

790
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,480
but

791
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
you got to do something and you've got

792
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
to start somewhere

793
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
and there's plenty of places where you

794
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
can start lifting in fact it was james

795
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
pope he didn't use his exact quote in

796
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
his keynote yesterday

797
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,200
but he often just says lift where you

798
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,919
stand like just do something with what

799
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,760
you've got if you can improve security

800
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,919
today and make it even just a little bit

801
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,080
better than it was yesterday regardless

802
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
of whether you accomplished

803
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
patch management for your entire

804
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
organization and can just like okay

805
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,640
we're done

806
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
or hey you've finished vulnerability

807
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
management for your entire organization

808
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
and you can

809
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,399
dust off your hands and call that done

810
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,320
some of those things are super hard and

811
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,559
crazy to do but we as security

812
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
professionals sometimes measure

813
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
ourselves with grandiose big projects

814
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
and things that we have to accomplish

815
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
when sometimes all we need to do is move

816
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,159
the needle

817
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,880
keep pro keep progressing keep making

818
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,200
good security choices

819
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,279
know that it's hard in some cases to

820
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,360
accomplish some of these big things

821
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,000
but move the needle continue to make it

822
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
better and find ways of doing that

823
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
you're always going to run into places

824
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,760
where you've got some executives saying

825
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
i'm not going to listen to the security

826
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,679
guys anymore like man they're costing us

827
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,480
money they're making our work hard

828
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,320
you know those kinds of things exist

829
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
they're true it's it happens out there

830
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,039
but we as security professionals can and

831
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,559
should always just

832
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,559
move that needle so i think that we're

833
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,840
pretty close to the end of my slides but

834
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,880
a couple of things that i wanted to

835
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,039

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
one of the things that i do every other

846
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,320

847
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,039

851
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,919

stuff that's happening right here right

855
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,200
now that you should probably have some

856
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
sort of security plan process or

857
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,240
procedure either in development or

858
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
implemented at that point where you talk

859
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,039
about the latest trends threats and

860
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,080

913

we encourage you to be involved in in

915
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,440
sync on the diversity of ideas

916
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,480
uh and and everything else brings the

917
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,679
community

918
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,240
different options and opportunities

919
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,840
one of the things that we do is in

920
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,640
january sometime i get from the end of

921
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,519
october to the beginning of january off

922
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,320
and that's it because by january we have

923
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,640
to start planning all over again that's

924
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
when we do our call for committee and

925
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
the committee for the utah or for the

926
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
saintcon conference these are the folks

927
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
that are in charge of

928
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
the major components of the conference

929
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
and so if you're interested in getting

930
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,480
really deep

931
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,240
into saintcon

932
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,960
you can join us at the committee level

933
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,760
and uh burn a lot of your time

934
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,159
what's more normal for people

935
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,480
is from the time that we do the call for

936
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,640
committee sometime by february or

937
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,399
through may it depends on timing and

938
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,440
some other things will often open up

939
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
call for contests events and other in or

940
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,480
and other things that really

941
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,559
evolves into the wrangling of a bunch of

942
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,240
staff members and so we have three

943
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
levels of of engagement within in st con

944
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
there's that committee level which

945
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,240
you're basically like a department head

946
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
uh and then we've got the staff level

947
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,000
which is these are the folks that are

948
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,480
running the iot village or the packet

949
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
capture village or in communities and

950
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,799
things downstairs

951
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,399
and that they're responsible for that

952
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
piece or component and so we start

953
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,080
wrangling them together there's no call

954
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,880
for staff you propose something

955
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,559
that you want to do and then we accept

956
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,000
it and you become a staff member and

957
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,919
then sometime generally around the

958
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,600
beginning of june we do a call for

959
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,960
volunteers

960
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
and this is where we get these types of

961
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,000
folks that sit up here joyfully big

962
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,159
smile under that mask

963
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,559
and just hang out and help us do the

964
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,720
small little things and they get to come

965
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
and attend the conference for free right

966
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,159
did you have to pay

967
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,159
didn't have to pay to be here gets to

968
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,360
come and attend

969
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,559
those are the ways that you can get

970
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
involved uh in the conference and that's

971
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,399
how we run it so

972
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,640
if that's helpful for you and you're

973
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,960
interested in becoming part of our

974
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,039
conference in our community watch for

975
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,960
those things most of these emails and

976
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,679
other things get sent out to previous

977
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
attendees and the utah saint lists that

978
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
are also in our disk will public we

979
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
publish our calls inside of our discord

980
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,719
server and other things so

981
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,239
we think that it gets enough traction

982
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,399
that we don't have to just random email

983
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,560
folks but anyways one of the questions i

984
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
get asked last slide and this is

985
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,719
literally the last slide and we'll fill

986
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,079
a bunch of time now that i've only done

987
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,440
what 35 minutes we're good

988
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,918
so it is random ask jupiter question

989
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,960
time

990
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
you can ask me anything

991
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,399
that you would like

992
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,239
and i'll do my best to answer it anybody

993
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,638

994
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,520
okay the little dinosaur at the front

995
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,399
why are you wearing this

996
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
so one of the things that we'll do from

997
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,359
time to time is we we like to troll some

998
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
of our committee members that have been

999
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
with us for a long time kevin has been

1000
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880

1002
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,560
he's one of those folks that we learn

1003
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,880
when you become a committee member you

1004
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
pretty much live at my house for the

1005
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
last month before the conference uh we

1006
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,520
get to to share all of the bugs and

1007
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
viruses and things i think we missed

1008
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,880
around a head cold pretty good within

1009
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
the committee

1010
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,119
um

1011
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
before the conference we all tested for

1012
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,760
cove with like 50 times

1013
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
uh during that time frame but yeah we'll

1014
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,359
troll and this is your troll for this

1015
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,480
year

1016
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,800
so there you go

1017
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,160
any other questions that was a great one

1018
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,399
come ahead

1019
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,440
that's a good question the jupiter

1020
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,359
handle okay so

1021
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
i i used to

1022
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,680
so

1023
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
i'm going to digress a little and then

1024
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
i'll get around to it how's that so the

1025
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,320
interesting thing

1026
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,280
about a hacker handle

1027
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
is that

1028
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,160
generally

1029
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,560
you get to choose your handle

1030
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
until someone else in the hacker

1031
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,440
community chooses one for you

1032
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,960
and so i've gone by many different

1033
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
things throughout the years and such

1034
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
but there's a point in time when some

1035
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,359
other

1036
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,960
senior hacker comes along and says hey

1037
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
you're

1038
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
your handle is now this and you just you

1039
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,079
don't have an opera you don't have an

1040
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,720
option that happened to me and so my

1041
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
handle was given to me

1042
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
by a senior hacker named chris eagle

1043
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,240
and

1044
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,160
anybody know who chris eagle is

1045
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,079
maybe one person right here in the front

1046
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,400
one in the back or whatever

1047
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,320
he chris eagle is one of the most

1048
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,000
talented reverse engineers in the world

1049
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,720
he can take a binary and he can reverse

1050
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,960
engineer it and so

1051
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,680
better and crazier than anybody he

1052
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
actually teaches

1053
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
master level classes of reverse

1054
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240
engineering at the naval academy

1055
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,079
and other places

1056
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
and works for three letter agencies and

1057
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
other things as a consultant from time

1058
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
to time when they're doing similar types

1059
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,599
of things

1060
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,560
and

1061
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,079
i had this wonderful opportunity many

1062
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
years ago to run the capture the flag

1063
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
competition

1064
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,320
for the defcon conference uh for those

1065
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,440
of you that are not familiar with that

1066
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,680
that's like the super bowl of

1067
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
geeks

1068
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,680
warring geeks with computers

1069
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,359
and things and so we had this wonderful

1070
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,920
opportunity and they had to change all

1071
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
of their handles so that nobody knew who

1072
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,359
they were

1073
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,440
on in the back of the scene and we all

1074
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,839
picked planets

1075
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,920
within the solar system so we had

1076
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,560
mercury and venus and all these other

1077
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
hacker handles going around

1078
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
and i was jupiter because i was the one

1079
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,839
that could get 20 other people

1080
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,359
there's 20 moons around jupiter by the

1081
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,760
way 20 other people together to help

1082
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
pretend that we were the ones running

1083
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
this entire capture the flag competition

1084
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,280
when it was really this whole other

1085
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,599
group behind the scenes so

1086
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,240
there you go that's why i'm jupiter and

1087
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
it kind of stuck after that that's what

1088
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,520
everybody called me

1089
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,960
good question though anyone else

1090
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,560
now's your chance i mean i'll answer

1091
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,760
anything

1092
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,160
go ahead

1093
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
so a good question do we ever run short

1094
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,240
of volunteers in our call for volunteers

1095
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
this year we sort of did it was kind of

1096
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
an interesting year

1097
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
you guys want more story time i'll tell

1098
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,160
you stories all day long if you want

1099
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
covid was kind of an interesting

1100
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,320
phenomenon as you know in my opener we

1101
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,640
talked about how hey it's july covet

1102
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,079
cases are dropping we're going to do

1103
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
this in person hell or high water

1104
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,240
bada bing we announced it and we go

1105
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,440
ahead with almost no covet restrictions

1106
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,000
in our mindset we're like we got this by

1107
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,200
the time october rolls around we're

1108
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
going to be great

1109
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
uh and then the interest and so we do

1110
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,720
our call for volunteers and we award a

1111
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,160
bunch of volunteers and we give them

1112
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,800
free passes and and everything else

1113
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,839
and ultimately this year in particular

1114
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,440
when we announced that you know what

1115
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,960
we've met we've thought about it we've

1116
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
deliberated we've talked about it and by

1117
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
the way i don't want to talk about covet

1118
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,720
at all ever again

1119
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
because we have talked it

1120
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,119
every single way but sideways

1121
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,440
but we did that and we decided we would

1122
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
have to put in some pretty stringent

1123
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
restrictions to keep our community safe

1124
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,599
uh and so we lost a lot of our

1125
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,560
volunteers uh we actually and i didn't

1126
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,079
tell talk about this in the opener but

1127
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,720
there was about 10 percent of the

1128
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
conference attendees that had signed up

1129
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,280
that requested refunds

1130
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,560
for the conference and when you're

1131
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
somebody like me who knows that we do

1132
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
this conference on a very much

1133
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,880
shoestring budget and you've got 10

1134
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
percent of your conference saying we

1135
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
don't agree with the fact that you're

1136
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
changing your covet policies

1137
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,280
um

1138
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,240
man

1139
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
there was there was some panic that

1140
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,880
slide that i showed you with the

1141
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,359
frazzled hair that was me literally for

1142
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,560
three months while we kind of went

1143
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,079
through this process and dealt with

1144
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,680
things

1145
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,440
and i know that it's not comfortable i'm

1146
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,280
not going to talk about covid much but

1147
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
we appreciate you

1148
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,960
being willing to do be here and be

1149
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,000
willing to follow some of those

1150
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,599
guidelines for us

1151
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,480
but

1152
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
volunteers yeah sorry that was the add

1153
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,240
moment volunteers we did struggle with

1154
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
this year we generally don't but we

1155
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,760
generally have anywhere between 100 and

1156
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,800
150 volunteers every single year doing

1157
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
different things there's registration

1158
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,119
volunteers there's commit or community

1159
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,040
volunteers there's av volunteers which

1160
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,200
is the premier team by the way you know

1161
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
you've arrived if you're one of the av

1162
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,920
guys

1163
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,960
they do a great job too right

1164
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,680
like listen it is not easy to get this

1165
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
to work with that monitor down there

1166
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
that i can see and then plug in

1167
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
interchangeably with the thousands of

1168
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
different types of laptops and other

1169
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,440
things and they do an exceptional job

1170
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
and so i can't thank them enough that

1171
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
applause you gave them is probably

1172
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,000
appropriate for now but give them more

1173
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,920
applause later maybe i don't know

1174
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,640
so yes but we appreciate more

1175
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,200
opportunity to have volunteers

1176
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,440
as part of sync on other questions come

1177
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,599
ahead

1178
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,480
i do remember the peacock demo

1179
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,400
yeah you want me to tell you a really

1180
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,560
scary story about that that demo though

1181
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
right okay story time again this will be

1182
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,640
fast but then i'll tell you the scary

1183
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,119
story about peacock okay

1184
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,800
and i don't my wife is here in the room

1185
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
and i don't even know if i've told her

1186
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,599
all of this

1187
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,280
story that i'll tell in a minute but

1188
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,040
yeah peacock anybody remember the little

1189
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
utility called peacock it's like

1190
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,640
p-w-a-w-k

1191
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,720
is what it used to be called

1192
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
and it was this really cool utility that

1193
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,599
spoke on the net biosport 139

1194
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,920
and allowed you to just send it at a

1195
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,400
machine and what it could do is based

1196
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,079
off of some authentication packets that

1197
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
it would send it could enumerate the

1198
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
password

1199
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
to join a net bios or a drive share so

1200
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,400
you could pop up and it'll say hey

1201
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,839
there's this drive share available this

1202
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,760
driveshare available in this one and you

1203
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,520
could click the button and it would just

1204
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,720
give you the password literally

1205
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
it was a terrible vulnerability way back

1206
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,319
in the windows 95 i think it was 95

1207
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,880
right 95.98 somewhere around there

1208
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,119
anyways one of the terrible crazy things

1209
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,079
about that is that we for a period of

1210
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,440
time

1211
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,359
you know ethics being somewhat of a gray

1212
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,079
area at the time right

1213
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,400
we started scanning large portions of

1214
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,800
the state of utah for port 139 being

1215
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,520
open and then we just send this utility

1216
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
after things

1217
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,280
and it did scare the crap out of us

1218
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,440
because we logged onto machines

1219
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,319
that port 139 was not being blocked on

1220
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,560
all over this great state

1221
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,880
and found all sorts of things like large

1222
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,599
lists of entire student bodies

1223
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,160
with their names addresses phone numbers

1224
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,560
birth dates social security numbers

1225
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,480
mother's maiden names and everything

1226
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,800
else you can think of just sitting out

1227
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,880
on drive shares back in the day

1228
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,319
and that was all there just for the

1229
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,520
taking

1230
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
and stuff so peacock is a great one

1231
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,359
here's the crazy story

1232
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,359
i once used that

1233
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,880
utility

1234
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,119
to enumerate

1235
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,839
uh some some machines in our local

1236
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
organization

1237
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
and one of the machines that i was able

1238
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
to run that against

1239
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,839
was none other than steve hess's

1240
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,359
personal workstation anybody know who

1241
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,040
steve hess is

1242
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,839
okay

1243
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,000
some of you do and you're you're you're

1244
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,720
probably going like oh crap

1245
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,520
okay this is basically at the time a

1246
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,119
senior vice president of the university

1247
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,599
of utah kind of person

1248
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,960
and things and

1249
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,599
on that drive i was able to find once

1250
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,000
a spreadsheet that had

1251
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,880
all of the salaries of every single

1252
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
person within our organization and i

1253
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
made the mistake of downloading that

1254
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
file and showing it to one of my work

1255
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,160
colleagues

1256
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,800
and i almost lost my job

1257
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
now that was the first time in fact i

1258
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,280
think that that was the first time

1259
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,800
uh that i

1260
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,319
had really

1261
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,880
crossed some sort of ethical line

1262
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,839
um and

1263
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,480
how do you put it

1264
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,599
where

1265
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,599
i could see what the outcome likely

1266
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,920
could have been for something like that

1267
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
but i had the opportunity to meet with

1268
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,640
steve

1269
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,560
and it was it was like my first meeting

1270
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
with he had no idea who i was i was just

1271
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,240
some punk

1272
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,520
i.t guy

1273
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,960
in one of the buildings with on the

1274
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,880
university of utah campus

1275
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
got to sit down and meet him and talk to

1276
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,920
him about this particular incident and i

1277
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,680
don't even remember what he said all i

1278
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
heard was well we're not going to fire

1279
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,319
you over this or anything but

1280
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,839
you know don't do this type of stuff

1281
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,440
again and you know kind of stay in your

1282
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,760
lane and do what do what you need to do

1283
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,440
and it started one of the best

1284
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
relationships with any executive that

1285
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,880
i've ever had

1286
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,800
in an organization like that so steve

1287
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,520
hess and i are really great friends we

1288
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,240
talk probably once or twice a month

1289
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,920
about different things i mean maybe not

1290
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,560
so much recently he's been doing other

1291
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,000
things and is involved in a lot of

1292
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,280
different things but

1293
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,079
uh and he has as much respect for me as

1294
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,160
i do for him nowadays and so there's no

1295
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,359
harm no foul uh historically but

1296
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,960
yeah there was a there was a weekend

1297
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,079
that i was wondering whether i would

1298
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,359
have a job when i went back to uetn uh

1299
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,920
on on the next monday morning so anyways

1300
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
sorry honey

1301
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,839
i don't know if i ever even i don't know

1302
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,000
if i ever told her that i mean maybe she

1303
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,760
sort of knew but i don't know

1304
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
let's just say that my stress level over

1305
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,839
that weekend was not great

1306
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,160
other questions great great story time

1307
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,160
right

1308
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
right

1309
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,720
this was as i was mentioning before the

1310
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,960
the hey we should even we should start

1311
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,880
with maybe firewalls in front of our

1312
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
networks this is what the network looked

1313
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,160
like back then

1314
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,319
we could run a port 135 or 139 scan

1315
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,359
on large swaths of the utah education

1316
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,960
connected network

1317
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,240
and see thousands of hosts like you

1318
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,720
wanted to search for pc anywhere back in

1319
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,000
the day anybody remember what pc

1320
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,319
anywhere even is right the pc anywhere

1321
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,480
ports some of these backup ports and

1322
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,839
other things those were just freely

1323
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,160
available you'd knock on them

1324
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,920
and and they'd be there if you had an

1325
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,040
ftp server with anonymous ftp access you

1326
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,079
had illegal files on there because some

1327
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,480
person uploaded them for you like they

1328
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,720
were using your ftp servers back then in

1329
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,920
those days

1330
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,119
for those types of things but you're

1331
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,720
right

1332
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,960
um that peacock was one of those things

1333
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,200
that got us together because there's

1334
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,000
nothing easier to show an executive then

1335
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,079
let me just click this button right here

1336
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,000
and let me show you this roster of

1337
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,280
students

1338
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
from this university down

1339
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,839
in the middle part of the state

1340
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,839
and when you can show that

1341
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,440
it doesn't take very long for them to go

1342
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,680
oh crap yeah how do we defend against

1343
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,760
this you know that firewall thing your

1344
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,359
i.t guys have been bugging you about for

1345
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,760
a long time we need that

1346
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,680
and so those kinds of things do occur

1347
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,640
and

1348
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,000
i've been around doing cyber security

1349
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,720
for a long time so i can tell weird dark

1350
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,559
stories like that from the olden days

1351
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,480
other questions we'll go one or two more

1352
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,800
and that's it

1353
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,760
let me editorialize that for a moment

1354
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,079
defcon black hat

1355
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,599
b-sides

1356
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,359
uh some of the other we'll call more

1357
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,200
rowdy conferences

1358
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,119
first and foremost

1359
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,200
the type of

1360
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,720
pope said it great

1361
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,040
uh yesterday and i'll just quote him and

1362
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,599
just say utah has

1363
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,040
the best

1364
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,319
by far security community and i.t

1365
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,880
community out there we're connected in

1366
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,480
so many different ways

1367
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,000
there's almost three defcon groups

1368
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,400
within our state where you can find

1369
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
whole swaths of the country that don't

1370
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,319
have a single defcon group out there i'm

1371
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
getting to your question

1372
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,400
we do the crud out of it and that's why

1373
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
something like saintcon is so successful

1374
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,160
but one of the other reasons why

1375
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
saintcon is successful is we're not a

1376
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,640
rowdy conference when you go to a place

1377
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,240
like defcon how many of you been to

1378
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,359
defcon

1379
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,440
okay so there's probably maybe a

1380
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,599
quarter or a third of you out there that

1381
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,839
have gone to defcon it's a different

1382
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,000
environment and this if you come from

1383
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,720
the

1384
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,920
the sheltered and i apologize if any of

1385
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,319
what i say becomes

1386
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,920
sort of offensive or anything i'm saying

1387
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,520
it just kind of for reference but if you

1388
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,240
come from the sheltered life and culture

1389
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,800
that we live most of us within the state

1390
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,480
of utah going to a place like defcon is

1391
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,200
not your scene generally and it's

1392
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,520
probably something that you should maybe

1393
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,079
go in with your eyes open or

1394
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,480
go in and be aware that

1395
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,800
seeing a guy walking down a hallway

1396
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,160
with a bottle that's this tall of

1397
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,520
bourbon

1398
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,880
and just walking casually is not

1399
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,040
un normal at a place like defcon

1400
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,760
uh you know i don't know if there's any

1401
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,520
hot defcon

1402
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,440
so the ant the question is are there

1403
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,680
hotels still there that ban the

1404
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,000
conference there were for many years

1405
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,160
defcon has become so big now and this is

1406
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,680
going to go to partially to answer your

1407
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,240
question as well defcon has become so

1408
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,480
large that now it's

1409
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,040
a lot just like most other conventions

1410
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,880
it's fairly safe

1411
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,800
for those of us that are sheltered and

1412
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,720
and have our you know have a different

1413
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,079
cultural background than what we

1414
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,200
normally see in the rest of the world

1415
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,599
so you can safely go to defcon and be

1416
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,920
okay but it's not going to be unfamiliar

1417
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,599
for you to be in a presentation where

1418
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,200
every other word starts with the letter

1419
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,720
f uh and and things like that we pride

1420
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,079
ourselves here

1421
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,160
at saint connor being a clean conference

1422
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
a place where you can bring your kids

1423
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,839
and i've seen a few of them around today

1424
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,920
you can bring your kids and feel

1425
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,520
comfortable with not having

1426
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,119
bad words now i can't say that you'll

1427
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,520
never hear one here because i can swear

1428
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,839
with the best of them

1429
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,079
but that's the type of difference so i

1430
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,760
hope that maybe starts to answer the

1431
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,680
thing or your question and i'll finish

1432
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,200
it with this

1433
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,400
defcon is where i learned

1434
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,800
about the value of community and what

1435
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
that means i've got some of my best

1436
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
friends and acquaintances that i've

1437
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,680
gotten or that i've achieved through

1438
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,960
that conference there are smart capable

1439
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,640
impressive people

1440
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,800
out there that attend that conference

1441
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,200
and so you can weed through the bad

1442
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,480
and absolutely find good wholesome

1443
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,640
things at def con and so i would never

1444
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,160
discourage somebody from going down

1445
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,240
there and experiencing that but just go

1446
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,760
in with your eyes open and knowing what

1447
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,800
you're getting into go ahead decast

1448
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,200
yeah go ahead

1449
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,440
yeah

1450
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,200
so for those of you that can't hear uh

1451
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,040
he said that he went down in 2019 for

1452
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,480
his first time

1453
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,640
and found the lonely hackers club

1454
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,280
uh at defcon which is a place where you

1455
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,040
can just go and find other people that

1456
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,040
have similar interests and other things

1457
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
and you probably communicate with them

1458
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,040
all the time and stuff now right

1459
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,440
like it's you build community we do

1460
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,920
community like crazy here in utah and

1461
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,440
we're happy to have you all here as part

1462
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,160
of our community but that's a bigger

1463
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,440
community

1464
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,520
better i mean there's smart people there

1465
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,960
there just really are you're walking

1466
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,040
around with people that

1467
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,680
do the three-letter agency things all of

1468
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,079
the time and stuff so last question over

1469
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,559
here go ahead

1470
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,760
did i look at the raw memory dump

1471
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,920
which raw memory double

1472
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
at the hackers challenge

1473
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,319
uh no i am not responsible for anything

1474
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,359
that has

1475
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,720
been associated with hacker's challenge

1476
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,160
is there stuff in there that shouldn't

1477
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,440
be

1478
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,800
okay

1479
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,880
be warned listen

1480
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,960
sometimes

1481
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,880
here's the last disclaimer

1482
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,760
sometimes we don't have all of the time

1483
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,000
in the world to check all of the content

1484
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,160
quick story last night for those of you

1485
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,920
that were expecting to see logan's run

1486
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,359
in movie night

1487
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,000
uh we didn't play logan's run because we

1488
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,680
found out that it had

1489
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,359
a nude scene in it even though it's

1490
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,119
rated pg-13

1491
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,640
uh and and things so so sometimes

1492
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,440
it's

1493
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,280
one of those things that i'm ready to

1494
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
play logan's run i never realized that

1495
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,760
it had a nude scene in it

1496
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,599
uh it's things like that so i hope

1497
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,359
you'll excuse the fact that sometimes

1498
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,960
you're going to run into things that

1499
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,440
somebody grabbed and shared from some

1500
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,960
other con where they don't care about

1501
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,720
that kind of stuff or maybe it's real

1502
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,640
life stuff that you're messing with that

1503
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,960
could be offensive or cause things you

1504
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,400

organization within this group but

1507
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,480
