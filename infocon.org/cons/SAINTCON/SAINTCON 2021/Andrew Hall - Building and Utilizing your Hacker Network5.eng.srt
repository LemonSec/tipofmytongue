1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
social networking to jobs um

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,480
kind of the points i went through

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,440
earlier

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,240
be careful what you do do not overdo it

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
do not kind of fake your profile too

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,040
much

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
there is the fake it till you make it

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,280
aspect but that doesn't always apply to

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
your social networks do be careful on

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
over exaggerating your experience and

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
other aspects because that can then

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
damage your brand

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,160
in the future if it doesn't come to

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,640
reality

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
apply put yourself out there if you're

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,960
searching for work

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,200
try to apply to everything within reason

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
you don't have to meet all categories

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,399
for a job

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
but it is good to you and to not give up

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
hope

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,839
as you go through

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
uh

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
in your career

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
as you go through even as an intern or

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
any other career aspects your co-workers

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
your supervisors other leadership in

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,800
companies it's good to get to know them

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
try to spend time and just meet them in

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
any opportunity you can it's a great way

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
to network and grow

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,680
yourself

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
others that you work with as they bring

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,040
in outside

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,759
help consultants and others it's good to

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,640
also

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
communicate and talk with them

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
organizations special interest groups

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
like infragard

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
are also great and some large

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,840
organizations will have community

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,799
practices that you'll be able to join

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
even if you aren't that familiar within

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
it alone will let anyone join and

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
participate it's great to go and learn

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
especially from the senior people in

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
your organization

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
on aspects of the company

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
mentory

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,399
key things for being a mentor or mentee

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
band how you go about it

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
is to leave your ego behind

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
prioritize a list of things that you

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,880
want to work with a mentor with uh

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,399
research your mentor

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
when you get connected with one kind of

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
learn about them it's also good to do

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,079
back and forth with them and get to know

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,720
them for first few sessions

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
which kind of deals with corn your

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
mentor you want to get to know them be

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
sincere be honest in your dealings with

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,799
them

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
kind of rushing this a little as we're

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
approaching end of time sorry

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
mentor if you are a mentor

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
it's key to understand your mentoring

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
kind of read between the lines to kind

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
of understand some of their issues

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
you've kind of been their shoes before

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
you have to go into it share experiences

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,319
as applicable

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
even negative ones you don't always have

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
to be positive it's always good to help

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,519
people

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,120
in all aspects

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and connect with them and as much as you

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
can

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
and helping them build their career

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
help them learn lessons that you've

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
learned

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
while in your career to help them grow

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,359
any questions

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
yes

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
oh

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,560
that one

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,319
this one

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,480
all right

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,519
yes

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,879
presenting really puts you out there

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
you get your name out there and

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,159
it

93
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
in some aspects if you aren't an expert

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
in the topic that you want to present on

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,640
it can make you an expert in the topic

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
and it gets people doing conversations

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,920
with you

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,760
because then you you're presenting

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
something new and even experienced

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
people that are way more experienced

101
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
than you on subject you might share

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
something and be able to then

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,519
develop conversations with them going

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,720
forward

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,238
so it is a stretch it is

106
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,560
normally an unorthodox way of going

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
about it in some cases but a lot of

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
cases i've learned that it helps you

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,759
really become more of a part of a

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,040
community too

111
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
you start presenting you'll present more

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
and more and then your network will grow

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
and more people will communicate you and

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
you'll share more information with each

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
other

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
kind of

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
destroy some silos in some aspects

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
because you're then able to communicate

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,280
people that you normally wouldn't be

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
able to especially if you're presenting

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
something outside of your normal

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
field of interest

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,080
any other questions

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
if not thank you all for coming to my

125
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
talk hope you enjoyed it

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,758
enjoy your day

127
