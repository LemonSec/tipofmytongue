1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
hi everyone okay welcome

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,679
uh

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,200
so

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,720
some of you might know me i'm almost

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,160
always down in lockpick village it's

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
kind of my jam sort of thing that got me

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,320
into security to begin with

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
so uh you might remember me from past

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
talks such as block picking 101

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,920
bought some lock picks now what

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
lock picking hollywood which is what we

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,199
did last year for saint con because they

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
wanted a virtual lock picking village

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,920
and i don't know how you do that

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
virtually so check out the video it's

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,239
kind of fun

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
picking locks and why physical security

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
is everyone's concerned blah blah blah

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,719
blah blah no one cares no one cares

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,160
so can you guess we're going to talk

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
about today

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
that's right lock bypassing something

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
i've never presented on or don't know a

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,599
whole lot about so

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
okay a little bit about me i'm calling i

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,559
go by didymus um it's spelled weird

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,640
because yeah it's actually st khan's

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
fault that i picked that handle i was

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,239
giving my very first talk and said hey

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,600
what's your handles like i don't have a

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
handle i don't game i'm not elite

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,519
hackers like cool what's your twitter

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
and this is back in like 2016. i was

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,840
like

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,320
boba fett survived like

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
you should pick a handle i was like okay

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,119
so i went with dynamis

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
um so yeah been picking locks for 14

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,240
years picked it up in college i had a

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,759
locksmith uncle who

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
taught me and i thought this is really

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,400
cool

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
and uh yeah my favorite bypass tool is

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,479
the under the door tool which we'll be

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
talking about and a lot of these tools

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
that we have in this presentation we're

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
going to have down in the lockpick

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
village

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
by day i'm a senior security engineer

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
pluralsight i'm a locks

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
lockpick enthusiast i have a wife four

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
kids we have a dog his name is

53
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
password123 but i got breached recently

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,720
so i have to rename my dog it's kind of

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,840
inconvenient

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
so

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,320
there you have it

58
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
and be sure to heckle as much as you

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
want in random and heckling i won't see

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,719
it during but i'll read it tonight and

61
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,079
cry because i don't have great

62
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
presentation skills

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
that's what the channel's there for it's

64
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
a safe space i think i don't know

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,360
all right few things about this so

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
like with lock picking similar with lock

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,479
bypassing

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
don't do illegal stuff don't do stupid

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
stuff or don't get caught

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,239
and a lot of my content i actually got

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,080
from the lock bypass village that they

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,840
have at defcon they have a website

73
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,360
bypassville.org um karen and bill had a

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
lot of great content i

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
i i didn't steal it but i'm going to

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
reference it a lot so i got a lot of the

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
stuff from there tried to build out the

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
lock bypass

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
things down in the village based on

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
things we had there so

81
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,480
there you go and then there's there's

82
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,319
other people who do a lot of physical

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
security pen testing things like that by

84
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
show of hands how many people actually

85
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
do that physical pen testing like on the

86
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
side or for your actual job i'm

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
genuinely curious

88
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
nice

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,480
all right

90
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,519
so

91
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
why bypassing so that's a good question

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,599
for those who actually do physical pen

93
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,080
testing for a living why would you want

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,599
a bypass instead of pick locks just

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,000
shout it out

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
it's

97
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
same reason you don't try to brute force

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
encryption

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,720
yeah it's faster it's

100
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
interesting

101
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,760
what's the difference that's what we're

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
going to talk about so

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
um

104
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
yeah i think that's uh yeah next slide i

105
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,799
think actually so

106
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
it is more reliable it is faster

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
and

108
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
um

109
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
speaking with different physical pen

110
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
testers they're like i will pick locks

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
kind of as a last resort because i can

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
almost get in

113
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,239
quicker using some of these other

114
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
methods and stuff so lockpicking is the

115
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
last resort it's still in their tool kit

116
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
but when they're trying to get in do

117
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
things quickly a lot of times they will

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
rely on bypassing

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,000
so what is bypassing i stole this from

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
karen from bypass village

121
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
so lock bypass involves ignoring the

122
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
lock altogether and finding alternative

123
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,280
ways to open the door or the cabinet or

124
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,959
whatever you're trying to get into

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,200
or even avoid having to use the door at

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,439
all sort of a situation and i'll have

127
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
some examples i'm going to have some

128
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,799
clips and everything and if we have time

129
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
i'll show them but yeah

130
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,840
so here's some terms no conditions but a

131
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,680
couple bypass terms we have latch

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
slipping and loiting

133
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,680
um shoving or shimming this sounds like

134
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
things you get in trouble for in grade

135
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
school that you do it during recess but

136
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
you know whatever

137
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,639
we have over the door and under the door

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
attacks um attacking hinges you know so

139
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
avoid the door knobs or locks altogether

140
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
you're just messing with hinges

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
um sensors these are things

142
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
you know that you have in like

143
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
commercial buildings and stuff think

144
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
fire code stuff

145
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
decoding magnets etc

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,880
there's definitely more this is a short

147
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
half hour thing hopefully so i can't go

148
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,720
through all of it and i'm no expert so

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
you know

150
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
is what it is

151
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
so this is the all-time

152
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
best hacker movie ever there's those

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,320
that believe that and then there are

154
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
those who are wrong but this is my

155
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,360
favorite hacker movie

156
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
and it actually aged really well i think

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
it came out in 92

158
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
and it's just really good

159
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,199
so robert redford was a physical contest

160
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
before they had a name for that

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
don't even joke about that and they have

162
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
to get into a secure lab and they have

163
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,479
this

164
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,360
thing

165
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
it looks like they just put it in

166
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,479
oh boy

167
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
there we go boy these are really hard

168
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,080
don't even mess don't even joke about

169
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
here maybe this might help the whole

170
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
buddy of mine who was in desert storm

171
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
sent it to me

172
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,639
of course he was on the other side

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,000
i love dan aykroyd's character in this

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
movie mother come on

175
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,440
my buddy

176
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,560
right

177
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
he was on the other side but

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,639
doesn't just take a second

179
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,039
this might work

180
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,639
my show of hands who has not seen the

181
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,800
movie sneakers

182
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
okay

183
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
those who have seen it you know it's

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
coming right

185
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,479
yeah

186
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,199
wait yeah

187
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,000
okay

188
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
i'll give it a shot

189
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
bypassed

190
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,280
success

191
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
i don't recommend doing that

192
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
i don't recommend doing that down in our

193
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
village please we do build these things

194
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,039
and all that stuff

195
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
so that's one way to do it you're

196
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,560
probably going to leave some evidence um

197
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
there are better ways there's lots of

198
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
interesting great youtube content

199
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
covering this

200
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
but we're going to talk about some of

201
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,759
the different methods that he could have

202
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
used but you know it's robert redford

203
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
now still pretty awesome

204
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
so loiting and latch slipping so these

205
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
are a couple different tools that we

206
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
have downstairs you can

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
test

208
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
try out with we were selling some of

209
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
them in the store but this top one with

210
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
the orange handle is a shroom tool or a

211
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,919
traveler's hook is another name for it

212
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,280
we have a few of these

213
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
these are really useful for moving the

214
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
latch over so sometimes you can mess

215
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
with a lock and try to pick it that way

216
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,479
or you can just reach between the door

217
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
frame get that out we have a full-size

218
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,479
door you can practice this on and we

219
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,840
have these little black

220
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
tabletop doors you can practice it

221
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
practice this on as well

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
a similar tool that's a bit thinner is

223
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
this mini

224
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
like slim jim you can get full-sized

225
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
ones but they have these mini gyms as

226
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
well we did have some in the store we

227
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
only had a limited set made or whatever

228
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
but we do have you know i i have one

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
here at laser etched with st con is kind

230
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
of fun

231
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
um i think i'll throw it in the box

232
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,960
later on in the lockwood village if you

233
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
want to win it

234
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
so latch slipping basic concept is this

235
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
you know it's

236
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,080
on the side of the door

237
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,759
you're actually attacking the actual

238
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
lock so this isn't the dead bolt

239
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
that actually slips in this is just the

240
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
latch and you're going to have two kinds

241
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,599
of latches on it so here in this side

242
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,280
corner you have one that does not have

243
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
that dead pin you can just move that

244
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
over there's some that have this pin

245
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,120
that if you push in

246
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
if it's a properly hung door that will

247
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
be pushed in and you can't move it in

248
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
there's a couple ways you can get around

249
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
that

250
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,319
and we can talk about some of the

251
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
different ways you can push really hard

252
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,759
on the door so it actually

253
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
disengages it and pushes it all the way

254
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,160
in

255
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
and then you can move it over

256
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
there's a few things like that

257
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
and if it's missing one altogether you

258
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
just use the shroom tool or the slim jim

259
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
and you kind of move it over

260
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,639
um

261
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
and with that i'm going to show a quick

262
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
little video this is from the not so

263
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
civil engineer he actually works for uh

264
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
lpl's company now hey everybody the not

265
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
so civil engineer here and today i want

266
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
to talk to you about loading loading is

267
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
the term used for bypassing the latch on

268
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
a locked door which either is improperly

269
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
hung or does not contain a dead latch

270
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,719
for a typical door latch mechanism the

271
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,240
lock prevents the door from being open

272
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,839
not by mechanically blocking the latch

273
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
from retracting rather by preventing the

274
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
handle from turning this allows us to

275
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
exploit certain latches by bypassing the

276
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
locking mechanism entirely and just

277
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
depressing the spring loaded latch

278
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
there is one additional common security

279
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
measure which is often put in place and

280
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
that's the dead latch the dead latch is

281
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
an extra plunger which when properly

282
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
installed remains depressed when the

283
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
door is closed the dead latch

284
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
mechanically blocks the latch from

285
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
retracting and prevents loading attacks

286
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
but when a door is improperly hung or an

287
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
overly large strike plate is used the

288
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
door can often times sit in the frame

289
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
with the dead latch not depressed when

290
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
this happens the door is vulnerable to

291
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
loading attacks

292
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,120
first let's quickly talk about the

293
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
direction in which doors open as that

294
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
dictates the type of exploit that will

295
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,480
be used if you're standing on the lock

296
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
side of the door and the door opens away

297
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,839
from you that means the chamfered edge

298
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,680
of the latch is facing you and tools

299
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
such as the wallet size door shim which

300
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
i showed how to create in my previous

301
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,720
video can be used simply to push the

302
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
latch out of the way we'll talk about

303
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
shimming in a second but you can buy

304
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
these or you can make them in the

305
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
reverse case where you're standing on

306
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
the lock side of the door and the door

307
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
opens towards you the chamfered edge of

308
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
the latch is now facing away from you

309
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
and hook tools such as the traveler hook

310
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
or the gym tool can be used

311
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
all right you get it good okay we'll

312
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
move on because because the time hey

313
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
everybody nope

314
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,959
there we go

315
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,360
so shimming shelving this is this is

316
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,640
where you attack it from the front of

317
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
the door this is where you would get

318
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,800
like a laminated something milk carton

319
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
um a lot of times you can just find this

320
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,880
in

321
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
like the trash or like someone

322
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
like let's just say you're doing a

323
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
physical pen test and you see a

324
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,839
laminated card you could do that

325
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,279
some hotels you can use the do not

326
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,440
disturb little door hanger thing as well

327
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
for things like that

328
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
sparrow sells some this is just going to

329
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
be a quick little thing but you can get

330
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
them in different sizes

331
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,988
[Music]

332
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
so that's basically it like carting the

333
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
lock sort of a thing credit carding same

334
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
sort of concept okay

335
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
under the door tool so

336
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,079
you would never guess what this does by

337
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,440
the description but it goes under the

338
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,839
door so typically you have a

339
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
you have a long hook with a right angle

340
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
at the top and then at the bottom you

341
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
kind of have this little handle candy

342
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,880
cane capital j shape thing

343
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
and then the basic concept you lay it

344
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
flat and you slip it underneath the door

345
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,959
and you're going to stand it up

346
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,200
and then you're going to loop it over an

347
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
ada compliant handle these are the kind

348
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
with the handles they can open up or

349
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,320
down

350
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
to be compliant and stuff

351
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,000
and basically you're going gonna

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
on the

353
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
on the side of the door that isn't

354
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
locked you're gonna

355
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
loop it over the handle and then pull

356
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
down once you can fill

357
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
that resistance and once it opens you

358
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
just push it open

359
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
we have a full-size door downstairs you

360
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,399
can test this out on it's fun

361
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,920
kids can do it too come tonight we'll

362
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,279
teach your kids how to break into doors

363
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
it's a great idea

364
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
see this from

365
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
i believe deviant uploaded this

366
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
but this is one they just made from a

367
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
coat hanger you can buy an actual one

368
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
you can make one for cheap all you need

369
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
is some wire a string and a hanger

370
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
yeah

371
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,959
basically you pull down keep going

372
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
see what he meant about the string

373
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,519
right on man nice

374
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,399
boom

375
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
throw on your hacker hoodie hacker i'm

376
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
in

377
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,760
okay so we've talked under let's talk

378
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
over

379
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
um i'm just going to show this because

380
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
lock picking lawyer uploaded this and

381
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
him and deviant can do better than

382
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
recognize these days for the generation

383
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
upon us now this my dear youngans is

384
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,000
called film

385
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
it used to come in your cameras

386
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
i wouldn't even know where to get any of

387
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
that

388
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
i actually have a friend in utah who

389
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,639
gave me some his name is infosec pope

390
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,160
and uh he's actually the person who

391
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
first showed me this technique and we're

392
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
all very grateful that he shared it with

393
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
the world shout out to pope

394
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
so what we're going to do

395
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,519
is feed a loop

396
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,600
over this door

397
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,480
all right

398
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
and as we're doing so we know about how

399
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
far we're dropping down we know how far

400
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,839
we want to drop down because the handle

401
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
on the inside is going to match the

402
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,480
handle on the outside obviously

403
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
we get to about here

404
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,399
i need to make an extra step which is

405
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
right now we're flat against the door i

406
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
want this to bow out slightly so i'm

407
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
going to feed a little more

408
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,760
of the outer loop

409
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,639
just

410
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
just a bit so the top side it's laying

411
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,079
on top of itself you're going to want to

412
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,000
change the top side down but keep the

413
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,279
bottom side and if we think we've got it

414
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,399
just got to walk it over

415
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,360
we have this as well downstairs on the

416
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,399
full-size door

417
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
come and check it out it would probably

418
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,680
help you if you're doing the los santos

419
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,479
challenge intent

420
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
we got it also while we're watching this

421
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,079
look at this door there's about five

422
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,040
different ways to get into this door

423
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,240
fantastic

424
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
then this is a bit quicker because he

425
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
doesn't have to explain it all as he

426
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
walks through it but

427
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
this would definitely be an unoccupied

428
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
room or after hours type thing because

429
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,319
otherwise you're going to think snake

430
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
it's a lot less covert just saying

431
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,680
people screaming snake and running

432
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,119
wait for it

433
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,440
i'm in

434
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
so what do we do if we want to harden

435
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,959
ourselves against that if i can pause

436
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,160
this i don't know if i can pause this

437
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
thing you try to make sure the top of

438
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
your door for

439
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
oops let's go back a little bit

440
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,600
so real quick

441
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,639
what are the five ways you could have

442
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
got into this door

443
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
just shout them out

444
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
about the pin the hinge pins

445
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
pop the hinge pins what else

446
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
is the first slide i talked about

447
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,760
loitine okay you could also pick the

448
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,519
lock

449
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
he he's using the over what else could

450
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
you have used if you can use the over

451
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,839
you can

452
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,720
you can use the under the door

453
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
oh kick it in well that's actually

454
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
swings towards him so i wouldn't

455
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
recommend yeah in the back

456
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
there you go

457
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
um also on the keypad depending on some

458
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
keypads you can actually slap a magnet

459
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,320
on the side so we're going to talk about

460
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
magnets in a second but

461
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
yeah also one thing i want to mention

462
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
when you're using bypass tools like

463
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,000
under the door over the tour before you

464
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
start feeding it on the other side

465
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,279
measure it on the side that's facing you

466
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,560
so you know exactly how far you need to

467
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
go down or how far you need to like put

468
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
under to reach up and get it makes it a

469
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,240
lot quicker same with the thumb latch

470
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
tool like figure out the angle you're

471
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
going to need it at before you try to

472
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
figure it out when you can't see what

473
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
you're doing

474
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
pro tip i'm not a pro but that's a tip

475
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,759
so yeah hinge pins for example

476
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,839
okay sensors request exit i'm sure

477
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
you've seen these i'm sure you've heard

478
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
them click uh different things like that

479
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
sorry this keeps falling down

480
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,519
um there's some different ways around

481
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,320
this who can think of a few

482
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
compressed air yep another video

483
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
so get compressed air hold it upside

484
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,759
down

485
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
that's right

486
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,199
you can also use like

487
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
you can like get a piece of paper a long

488
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,079
piece of cardboard and wave it

489
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,120
underneath or you could

490
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
um oops

491
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
or you could do a couple other things

492
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
like one of those long inflatable

493
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
balloons if you could somehow rig an

494
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,680
inflatable party sheep and get that

495
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,199
under the door and inflate it i don't

496
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
know there's

497
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,079
possib there's literally fives of

498
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,519
possibilities

499
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
so

500
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
decoding this is another thing you can

501
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,279
do we have a couple of these locks

502
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,399
downstairs

503
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,639
and um basically this is where you would

504
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
fill inside

505
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,320
with a decoder tool it's a lot thinner

506
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
than a lock pick and basically you're

507
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,920
going to fill the gates

508
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
on those wheels to try to figure out the

509
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
combination i don't have a good video on

510
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
that

511
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
downstairs we can teach you how to do

512
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,560
this by touch which is helpful as well

513
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,680
we have a couple locks where we can

514
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
teach you this makes escape rooms a lot

515
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,799
easier if you know how to do this by

516
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
hand

517
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,520
so we'll teach you how to do that

518
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
gosh

519
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,240
okay comey lpl talked about this in his

520
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
uh talk we have a couple of comb picks

521
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,439
downstairs and a couple locks

522
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,199
susceptible to this but this is

523
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,880
basically

524
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
i consider this picking because you're

525
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,199
actually attacking the pins so

526
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,480
bypass

527
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,319
you know there's a whole argument on

528
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,679
reddit somewhere about this if this is

529
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
picking or bypassing i don't care anyway

530
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
this is something you could do so

531
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
basically what you're doing here if you

532
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
can see in the green one the exact same

533
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,919
image lpl used he's actually pushing or

534
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
the person is actually pushing up both

535
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,400
sets of pins in each stack

536
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
so high above it so if you have it

537
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
properly machined and you can't push it

538
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
all the way up you wouldn't be

539
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
susceptible to this combing attack but

540
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
with basically a comb you push them all

541
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
the way up and turn it come on down to

542
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
lockpick village we have a couple comb

543
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
picks you can also buy these it's really

544
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,440
simple padlock shams we do have some of

545
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
these and i just remembered i left them

546
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
in the box

547
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,000
so they haven't been on the tables yet

548
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
but basic concept with these padlock

549
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
shims

550
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
is you can put them around the sides

551
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
and actually disengage the

552
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
the locking pulse

553
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,200
locking poles i'm not sure what it's

554
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,160
called

555
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
i have no brain fart right now so

556
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
but basically you put those in and move

557
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,120
it and then you can pop open the

558
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
padlocks with that

559
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
you can also make these yourself out of

560
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,799
tin foil out of a pop cans i don't

561
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,480
recommend it because it's kind of sharp

562
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,360
and it can actually break off and here's

563
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
a picture of someone i don't remember

564
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,520
who

565
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
making one on the spot at the vault this

566
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,919
was

567
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,840
st con

568
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
2017. there was a padlock and like i'm

569
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,559
going to just shim this

570
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,440
magnets this is going to be a quick one

571
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,600
because we're almost out of time

572
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
but magnets so this would be like your

573
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
combination indoors if you look that's

574
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
the actuator there so you can watch as i

575
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
turn it

576
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
no code

577
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,960
it's not opening

578
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
but take the magneto put it onto the

579
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
side and now watch the actuator

580
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
and it goes it really is that simple

581
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
it's almost voodoo like

582
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
take it off put it to the side

583
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,559
watch the actuator turn

584
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,400
not opening anymore

585
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
and that's the magneto when it gets to

586
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
your house just be careful on packaging

587
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
it

588
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,520
sucker strong

589
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
the magneto by sparrows

590
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
you can get it from sparrows they even

591
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
have uh

592
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
they even have magnets that i think it's

593
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
on lpl site that you can actually turn

594
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
on and off you can actually activate so

595
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
you can safely carry it around with you

596
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
i don't recommend carrying it in your

597
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,080
pocket next to your phone or your

598
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
metallic prosthetic leg you know things

599
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
like that

600
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
the thumb latch tool this is a dangerous

601
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
one this one's kind of fun we have one

602
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
downstairs come and try it out learn how

603
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,000
to use it you can get these on websites

604
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,960
as well

605
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
and you can even get them on etsy i saw

606
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
a whole bunch on etsy ones

607
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,640
but the basic concept with this is you

608
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
reach in through a door typically one

609
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,840
that has windows or like the california

610
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
you know all glass doors and the locks

611
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,200
clear on the bottom basically you'll

612
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
reach in and just turn the thumb latch

613
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
and let yourself right in why try to

614
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
pick this lock when you can just reach

615
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
around and do it thumb latch tool

616
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
now for kids

617
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,799
okay kind of a kind of a recap some of

618
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
the tools this is nowhere near the

619
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
amount of tools and you can make a lot

620
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,799
of these tools yourself which is

621
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
actually more fun

622
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,080
under the door tool you can make it you

623
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,919
can buy it

624
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,600
the double door tool we do have one of

625
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
these but we don't have any double doors

626
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
we can test it on unless we want to take

627
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,280
off the event staff here but this is

628
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,640
basically a tool that you will reach

629
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,320
through with double doors and then twist

630
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
it 90 degrees and then pull on the crash

631
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,159
bar or the push bar to open from the

632
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,120
inside

633
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
i got a video of it

634
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
mini gyms these are the decoders these

635
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,960
orange things where you can fill the

636
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
combination wheels and stuff this is

637
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
called a gate pass but basically

638
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,640
sometimes you think oh i don't want

639
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,080
people loading my thing so i'll put a

640
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,159
big face plate over the front of it well

641
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,200
you just get a tall enough piece of

642
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
metal and you go on top of it and you go

643
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,159
behind it

644
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
boom you're open

645
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,799
um a couple resources not so civil

646
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,080
engineer has a bunch of great youtube

647
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
videos deviants channel has a bunch of

648
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
youtubes and talks where he's talked

649
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,200
about it

650
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,039
lock bypass village they have videos and

651
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
bypassvillage.org

652
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
coastal fire training so these are

653
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,799
respectful entry

654
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
uh firefighter videos and tools that

655
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
they can use

656
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
um to basically get into things so

657
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
instead of just going after it with your

658
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
handling tool or whatever they have like

659
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,039
no there's more respectful easier ways

660
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
to use so these same concepts are

661
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
bypassing they teach to firefighters

662
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,039
that's really cool also we have a copy

663
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
of this book downstairs i bought it it's

664
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
called tactical lock picking my only

665
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
complaint it should be called tactical

666
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
lock picking and bypassing because it

667
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
talks about a lot of bypassing also like

668
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,840
decoding like key boxes that are like on

669
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,559
airbnbs or realtor things and stuff like

670
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,440
that but it's a great resource

671
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
and uh

672
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
that is pretty much my talk i think this

673
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
is just a bunch of

674
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
videos of different ways you can do

675
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,080
things

676
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
so

677
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,799
do you want to turn down the audio track

678
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,720
and if anyone has questions i'll just

679
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
answer them as we watch these but

680
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
does anyone have any questions or

681
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,159
comments or

682
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,120
heckling they don't want to type

683
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
for round doorknobs was it like a reach

684
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,840
up and kind of a

685
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,120
that's awesome

686
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
i'd love to see that

687
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
so what he said if you didn't hear they

688
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
several years ago at the u they had a

689
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,000
under the door tool for round doorknob

690
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
style not the handle style but the

691
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,679
doorknob style that reach up and around

692
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,880
and you know

693
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
you can get creative you can make these

694
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,039
things on your own

695
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
so

696
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
yeah there's a random random piece of

697
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
plastic just

698
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
you know shove it in bam network closet

699
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
so what do we take from this how much

700
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,520
money do we spend on firewalls and

701
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
networking and protecting our corporate

702
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,440
infrastructure and then we put a 15

703
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
hardware store lock on our network

704
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
closet

705
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
so

706
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,559
that's an example of the gate tool did

707
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,679
everyone see that

708
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
goes behind here's the double door tool

709
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
where you just pop it open

710
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
there's another double door tool

711
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
obviously at a hotel or a conference

712
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
center or sometime i didn't want to

713
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,840
try it and get in trouble

714
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
i feel like some cooler hacker music

715
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,760
would be good with this but on the

716
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
videos like this

717
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
meditation calming stuff it's just not

718
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,840
near as fun

719
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
boom you can use that or in a pinch

720
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
if you don't have compressed air you can

721
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,320
make your own

722
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
any flavor you want tangerine blueberry

723
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
you know

724
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
or if you have some scotch you know that

725
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,080
works too

726
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,159
this is one of lock picking lawyers

727
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,480
videos so this he was talking about

728
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,520
illegal park booting situation

729
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
so he had this uh that's a tubular lock

730
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
pick we have one of those downstairs

731
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
it's hidden but if anyone has a tubular

732
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,559
lock and want to play with that a little

733
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
bit we have that we also have some of

734
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
these in the los santos challenge

735
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
i shouldn't show this because we have

736
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
this exact model of safe that has a lock

737
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
picking rfid tag in it

738
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,760
this is another lock picking lawyer

739
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
video

740
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
i have a feeling after this conference

741
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,919
that safe is going to need to be

742
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,000
completely rebuilt or replaced

743
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,279
so really expensive tool that's called a

744
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
coat hanger

745
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,480
probably shouldn't have shown that at

746
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,679
this conference because we have that

747
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
exact one in the lockpick village but

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,120
there you go

749
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,520
so this is the california no hinge no uh

750
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
um insulation thing

751
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
they're like they always do this in

752
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,320
california just glass doors and that's

753
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,720
what i'm protecting my teslas with

754
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
