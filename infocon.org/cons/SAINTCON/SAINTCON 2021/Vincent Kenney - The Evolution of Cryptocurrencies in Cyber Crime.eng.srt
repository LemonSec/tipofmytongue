1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,320
um this is the evolution of

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,799
cryptocurrencies in cyber crime so hello

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,000
everyone

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,919
i'm going to be talking about this topic

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,000
and um it's been a really really

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,719
interesting domain to sort of view this

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,400
cryptocurrency domain over the past

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,599
couple of years

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
so about me

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
i'm vince kenney i'm a computer

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,439
scientist with the fbi salt lake city

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
division and i've been working there now

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
for about six years

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
and i've been monitoring this domain for

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
quite some time since there are a lot of

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
threat actors that use cryptocurrencies

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
to sort of facilitate crime

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,960
so

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
in reality

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
this is not a talk about

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,920
cryptocurrencies but it's a talk about

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,559
financially motivated cyber actors

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,200
historically so these guys

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
so historically

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
financially motivated cyber actors have

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
been seen as more of a nuisance as

27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
opposed to a real threat i mean even in

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
this scale you can see the guys in green

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
are the hacktivists the criminals and

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,039
really the guys in red and orange are

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
the warfare and terrorist individuals

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
however over this past year there's been

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,280
an alarming rise in the tactics that

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
these financially motivated cyber crime

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
actors use

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,960
where they're using the tactics of

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
terrorism they're using the tactics of

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
warfare to be able to promote their

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
cyber crime activities

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
and receive financial gains from that

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,320
so we've really seen the level of

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
sophistication of financially motivated

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
cyber crime rise significantly over this

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
past couple years

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,759
so if this isn't a talk about

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,759
cryptocurrencies and it's a talk about

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,159
financially motivated cybercrime why is

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
it titled the evolution of

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
cryptocurrencies in cybercrime

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
well the way that i structured this talk

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,960
is not to really talk about different

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
financial actors and their specific

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
threat actor models and threat actor

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
activity but really center around

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
a technology that all of these actors

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
use

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
and that's not to say that technology is

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,038
bad

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,920
but rather bad people use technology to

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
do things so i could have easily made

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
this presentation about the evolution of

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,920
social media in cyber crime the

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,640
evolution of iot devices in cyber crime

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
the evolution of insert technology here

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
in cyber crime

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
i think there's just been a lot of news

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
lately about these financially motivated

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
cyber actors and oftentimes

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
cryptocurrencies are brought up as a

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
topic of interest

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
so i think there's some value in

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,238
discussion in discussing this

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
so without further ado with that caveat

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
we will dive into this evolution of

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,400
cryptocurrencies in cyber crime so in

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
particular we're going to be going

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
through four different evolutionary

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,040
stages

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
criminals using cryptocurrencies

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
as a means of buying selling and

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
exchanging them for goods and services

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,120
the rise of cyber digital extortions

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
and the targeting of individuals who use

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
cryptocurrencies for totally legitimate

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
means

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
as well as the targeting of new

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
protocols that are being layered on top

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,519
of the blockchain technology itself

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
okay so in this first stage in the

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
evolutionary process we see that

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
cryptocurrencies are used in the

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
criminal underground

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
and in this domain we're really talking

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,440
about dark web marketplaces criminal

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
forums and other areas criminals gather

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,159
online to exchange goods and services

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
so the grandfather of all darknet

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
marketplaces

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
is the silk road the success of the silk

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,760
road has come with two major things

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
the ability to host a website through an

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
anonymized dns service so through the

103
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
tor network and the torq dns protocol

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,680
and also the use of a permissionless

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
digital currency

106
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
so silk road is oftentimes referred to

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,840
as bitcoin's first killer app

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,920
because it was really the first time

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
that bitcoin actually had value in a

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
digital type of capacity

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
but this marketplace also created some

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
other innovations such as a digital

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,880
escrow system

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
in the end though the silk road was

115
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
taken down and left people with the

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
question of how anonymous is bitcoin

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
really

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
so in this this silk road evolution

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,320
bitcoin came around in about 2009

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
shortly after the silk road was created

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
then an open source

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
news outlet gawker had sort of reported

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,479
on it

124
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
the fbi new york city field office found

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
about out about this and after about a

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
year or two of investigating it they

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
finally took it down in 2013.

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
okay

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
so now through the next

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,160
stage of the criminal underground alpha

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
bay is the next evolution in the dark

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
dark web marketplace

133
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
space

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
alpha bay was much larger

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
a much larger marketplace than the silk

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
road and alphabay really modeled itself

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
after ebay or normal websites that have

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
lots of services in place for sellers

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
and vendors of that website really one

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
of the things that alphabet tried to

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
pioneer is it's not just a place for two

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
people to meet it's a place for you to

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
create your product you to have a vendor

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
service and for you to continuously sell

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
those services so it was really targeted

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,240
around being able to stay there and and

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
sell lots and lots of different products

148
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,479
on that marketplace

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,240
alpha bay had a number of different

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
rating systems the ability to chat

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
through encrypted means

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
and they really started to push bitcoin

153
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,800
tumbling and bitcoin mixing into their

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
escrow process so they learned from some

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
of the the takedown efforts uh through

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
the silk road to try and anonymize their

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
cryptocurrencies

158
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
so the other thing that alpha base

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
started to push just before it too was

160
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
taken down was the use of privacy coins

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
to make transactions

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
so the evolutionary steps that alphabet

163
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
brought into this space is that alphabay

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,160
um incorporated privacy abstractions for

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
cryptocurrencies but also the means of

166
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
being able to swap coins so one

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
or make transactions in other currencies

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,039
beyond bitcoin

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
now we get to the modern age of the dark

171
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,600
web marketplaces with hydra marketplace

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
and hydra truly lives up to its name it

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
is a monster in this market in this

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
marketplace space so hydra is a

175
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
russian-speaking marketplace and it is

176
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
the most dominant force in the dark web

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
marketplace space

178
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
hydra took many of the innovations of

179
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
alpha bay and silk road but hydra is not

180
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
just a marketplace but it's also a dark

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
web services nexus

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
therefore hydra offers a wide variety of

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,919
money laundering services and different

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
types of cryptocurrency services to its

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
platform

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
so if you think of the silk road as the

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
amazon of 1999 hydro marketplace is the

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,440
amazon of today

189
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
in fact one of the most interesting

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,280
aspects of the criminal underground is

191
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
the fact that it's becoming its own

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
digital economy if you need a venture

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,520
capitalist to invest in your cyber crime

194
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,599
startup you can go there and find one

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
if you need to access supply chain like

196
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
services to help facilitate crime it's

197
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,199
available there too

198
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
so one example really interesting

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
example that came out over the summer is

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
the service called anti-analysis

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
and so this tool actually provides

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
individuals who are money laundering

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
services or individuals that use

204
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
cryptocurrencies on this platform a way

205
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
of scoring or risking uh providing risk

206
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
factor information based off of the

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
cryptocurrency that you have so if you

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
need a verification service for these

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
money laundering services you can use a

210
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,039
tool like this

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
okay so we just talked a lot about

212
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,560
criminals using cryptocurrencies but now

213
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
there's this new evolution evolutionary

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
step which is bringing the non-crypto

215
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
world into the crypto domain

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,160
in particular into the criminal crypto

217
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
domain so this was done really through

218
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,120
the rise of cyber extortions

219
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
that's sex dorsions blackmail and

220
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,039
certainly ransomware

221
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
okay

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
in the earlier days of rants so so these

223
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
are the early days of ransomware so

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
ransomware has actually existed far

225
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,360
longer than cryptocurrencies have

226
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
in fact i believe one of the earliest

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
instances of ransomware was back in the

228
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
1980s

229
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,279
where an individual created a ransom

230
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
program on a floppy disk drive

231
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,240
mailed it to all his victims and once

232
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
the victims put the floppy disk into

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
their computer they were infected with

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
the ransomware and instructed to wire

235
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,160
money to a bank account

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
however in the modern ransomware age

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
there's no denying that cryptocurrencies

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
had a new element to ransomware

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
in the earlier days of ransomware

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
the rules were pretty simple

241
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,399
someone would download ransomware to

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,600
their computer

243
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
and their files were locked up then they

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
had to pay a small ransom in bitcoin in

245
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
order to unlock them

246
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
and you would oftentimes see cartoons

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
like the one here

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
that people kind of joked you know

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
what's a wannacry it's a ransomware

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
variant but also what's a bitcoin um and

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,680
people were unaware of this new type of

252
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
digital currency or digital extortion

253
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
means that these ransomware actors were

254
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,079
using

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
the next evolutionary stage in the cyber

256
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,959
extortion and ransom domain

257
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
is ransomware as a service

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
so ransomware changed from being a

259
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,640
nuisance to now being a business model

260
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
the biggest evolutionary step of

261
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,200
ransomware as a service was the scale of

262
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
attacks

263
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
initially the scale translated into a

264
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
number of ransomware attacks more

265
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
ransomware attacks

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
but now it's actually shifted really to

267
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,680
the quality of ransomware attacks going

268
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,079
after high value targets by

269
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
incorporating this affiliate model

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
ransomware developers can franchise

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
their ransomware software and rebrand

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
every few months

273
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
so with having richer targets

274
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
came larger demands

275
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
this new model also came around the time

276
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
where cryptocurrencies were starting to

277
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
gain more mainstream adoption

278
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
therefore it became easier for victims

279
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
to liquidate more fiat money into

280
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,680
cryptocurrencies

281
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
and now we finally get into the modern

282
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
age of cyber extortion where ransomware

283
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
is just a small piece of that

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
there is a multi-layered criminal

285
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
extortion

286
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
enterprise that that happens through

287
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
these ransomware campaigns

288
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
now most financially motivated cyber

289
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,440
actors can perform double triple and

290
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
even quadruple and more different types

291
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
of extortion schemes to be able to get

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
victims to pay ransoms

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
some like the babook ransomware variant

294
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
run leaks websites to publicly shame

295
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
their victims into paying ransoms

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
there are probably a dozen other talks

297
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
at this conference that will touch on

298
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,040
all the modern woes of ransomware today

299
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
cryptocurrency plays a part in the cyber

300
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
extortion space but in and of itself is

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
not the real problem

302
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
however one of the problems is the

303
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
integration of cryptocurrencies with

304
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,560
traditional financial services

305
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
so the vast majority of ransomware

306
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,360
actors use exchanges

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
to send victim money to liquidate it

308
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
back into their country's fiat currency

309
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
even though cryptocurrencies have had

310
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,519
more adoption in purchasing of normal

311
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
goods and services there's still a large

312
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
need for translating ransom proceeds

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
into other fiat and even other forms of

314
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
digital currency

315
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
in recent recent

316
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
news the u.s treasury department

317
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
recently announced announced sanctions

318
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,760
against the sussex cryptocurrency

319
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
exchange

320
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
based on the fact that they have

321
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
received hundreds of millions in ransom

322
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,760
proceeds highlighting the need for these

323
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
different crypto to fiat even uh fiat to

324
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
crypto and even crypto to crypto

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
exchanges to have some kind of standards

326
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
to deter this activity

327
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
okay

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,639
so we're moving on to the yet another

329
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
evolutionary stage this is targeting

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
individuals and institutions in the

331
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency

332
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
space so we're really moving into the

333
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,760
cryptocurrency domain and the victims in

334
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
this space are not pulled into the

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
cryptocurrency domain but rather are

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
targeted because they're in there to

337
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,959
begin with

338
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
so examples of this

339
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
is sim swapping

340
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
crypto wallet malware and targeting of

341
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
cryptocurrency institutions and more

342
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
so first up we come up with sim swapping

343
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
this is actually an attack that

344
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
originated from the hacktivist threat

345
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
actor group as a means to social

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,920
engineer their way into taking over cell

347
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
phones and accounts connected with those

348
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
cell phones

349
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
one year

350
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,600
one one of the earlier examples of this

351
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
is the infamous hack by hacktivist group

352
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,800
crackers with attitude who took over the

353
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,680
cia director the then cia director john

354
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
brennan's email account they did this by

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
social engineering their way into the

356
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
cia director's verizon account

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
now sim swapping has become a technique

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
cyber criminals will use for financial

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
gain

360
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
just a few weeks ago there was a

361
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
reporting that hackers exploited

362
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
two-factor authentication through sim

363
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,399
swaps to steal over 6 000 different

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
customer accounts from the coinbase

365
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,880
cryptocurrency exchange

366
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
this is an evolutionary step where

367
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
victims who have totally legitimate

368
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
means and reasons to use

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
cryptocurrencies have become the target

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
of these these criminal actors because

371
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,199
cryptocurrencies are an easy and finite

372
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,040
nature of making a transaction

373
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,399
next up we talk about crypto wallet

374
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
malware

375
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
so if criminals can't gain access to an

376
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
individual's account through an exchange

377
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,199
they can try to trick them into

378
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
downloading and installing crypto wallet

379
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
malware

380
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
in fact earlier in the year there was a

381
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,279
malicious version of the popular trezor

382
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,920
hardware wallet software hosted in the

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,680
apple app store it was soon taken down

384
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
but not after claiming a number of

385
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
victims

386
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,480
there have been some really interesting

387
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
hacks around also modifying not only the

388
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
wallet software but the hardware wallets

389
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
themselves and trying to pass them off

390
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,839
as new and selling them for deep

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,440
discounts online

392
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,959
since hardware wallets are generally

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
considered the safest types of wallets

394
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,440
to have most attackers assume they will

395
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,279
get the biggest prizes for going after

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,279
them

397
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,000
so this this mark really right um this

398
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,959
this kind of mark of of malware based uh

399
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,079
wallet software kind of rises to um

400
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,800
these actors targeting individuals that

401
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
don't host cryptocurrencies on

402
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
cryptocurrency exchanges

403
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
okay finally we get into the nation

404
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
state actors

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,240
so um

406
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,079
back over about a year ago there was a

407
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,040
new apt threat actor called crypto corps

408
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,279
that originally had been attributed to

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,440
an unknown eastern european organism

410
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
organized crime group

411
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
however more recently there have been

412
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
multiple reports to attribute this

413
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
crypto core apt threat actor to the

414
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
lazarus group a north korean threat

415
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,600
actor group

416
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,759
so cryptocurrency specific is targeting

417
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
institutions as a means to rob exchanges

418
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
and legitimate cryptocurrency

419
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
institutions they are literally the bank

420
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,320
robbers of the 21st century

421
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
okay and the last evolutionary stage so

422
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,959
we walk through criminals using

423
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,199
cryptocurrencies criminals extorting

424
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
victims criminals targeting victims in

425
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
the cryptocurrency space now it's the

426
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
targeting of blockchain technologies

427
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,320
itself through things like network

428
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,199
attacks protocol attacks and defy

429
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,599
attacks

430
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
so while end users tend to be the

431
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
weakest link in the security of

432
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
cryptocurrencies the cryptocurrency

433
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,839
network itself can sometimes be a point

434
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
of failure especially for new

435
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,839
cryptocurrencies that haven't had time

436
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,199
to mature

437
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
in this example bet coin dice

438
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,519
experienced a similar attack to a 51

439
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
percent attack back in 2013 when the

440
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
attacker was able to use a centralized

441
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,040
mining pool called g-hash dot io to

442
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
steal an estimated 1000 bitcoins from

443
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,959
the site the attacker was able to

444
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
manipulate the blockchain in a manner

445
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,439
where he could recall lost bets

446
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
in particular the bitcoin blockchain

447
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
actually went through its most rigorous

448
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,160
network test back in 2017 during the

449
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
block wars where a small but powerful

450
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
group faction of the bitcoin community

451
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,000
wanted to increase the bitcoin

452
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
transaction block size this eventually

453
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,559
led to the creation of bitcoin cash but

454
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
for a while there was real concern that

455
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
the smaller group that had a significant

456
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
percentage of the hashing rate on the

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
bitcoin network could manipulate the

458
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
blockchain

459
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
the next attack is the hack of the

460
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
original ethereum dao which was a

461
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
pivotal point in ethereum's history the

462
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
dow or decentralized autonomous

463
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,640
organization as a nexus to manage smart

464
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
contracts to be incorporated into the

465
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
ethereum platform and a lot of ethereum

466
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,000
users put ether into this original dao

467
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
so much so that when the attack occurred

468
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
the attacker gained such a huge pool of

469
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
ether that the ethereum developers

470
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
decided to burn the ether and burn the

471
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
attacker's money and fork the the

472
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,240
ethereum network

473
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
thus creating the ethereum classic

474
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
network that maintains the state of the

475
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
pre-dow hack for the ethereum chain

476
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,080
this hack was caused by a reentrancy

477
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,799
attack which is the use of a fallback

478
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,120
function combined with a syntax error

479
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,799
into to effectively drain an account

480
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
this evolutionary step opened up a

481
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
totally new domain of attack vectors for

482
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
blockchain technologies

483
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
and finally we get to the d5 space so

484
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,000
one of the main recipients of these new

485
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,880
attack vectors is the d5 space

486
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
d5 is basically building financial

487
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
products on top of blockchains

488
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
there have been numerous defy hacks over

489
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
the past few months and this past year

490
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,559
in fact i haven't looked it up but if

491
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
someone told me that more cryptocurrency

492
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
was lost in defy hacks than in

493
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
ransomware attacks i wouldn't be

494
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
surprised

495
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
the biggest one happened recently to the

496
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
pali network the pali network suffered a

497
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,840
loss of approximately 610 million in u.s

498
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,960
dollars

499
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
with uh of crypto assets

500
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
um the story actually has a good ending

501
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
there's kind of an interesting couple of

502
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
days of of what happened through this

503
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
attack um the the attacker actually

504
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
returned uh the cryptocurrency that was

505
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
stolen and was rewarded with a bug

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
bounty

507
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
so the moral of that story is that bug

508
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
bounties work if the incentives are put

509
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,720
in place

510
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,799
so

511
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,440
in conclusion

512
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,000
we are constantly encountering new

513
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,679
technologies in the crime fighting

514
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
domain in fact one of the reasons why

515
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
the fbi was established was to stop

516
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
criminals who were using the new

517
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,919
technology of automobiles and asphalt to

518
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
rob banks

519
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,480
up here

520
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
on the screen is a picture of bonnie

521
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
from the infamous bonnie and clyde crime

522
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,520
duo

523
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
that group completely stumped law

524
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
enforcement for years

525
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,760
and that that resulted in a number of

526
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,080
different changes to the way us law

527
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,760
enforcement works

528
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
so at the end of the day there's no need

529
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
to fear new technology there's a need to

530
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
understand it

531
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
and my kind of take on it is for new

532
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
technology is you can either run from it

533
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,799
or learn from it

534
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,080
and i intend to do the latter

535
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,080
thank you everyone that's all
