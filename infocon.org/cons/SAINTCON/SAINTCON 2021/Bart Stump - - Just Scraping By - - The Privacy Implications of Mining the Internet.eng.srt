1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
my name is bart stump we talk about uh

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,040
talk is just scraping by privacy

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,759
implications of mining the internet and

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
kind of digging through and seeing what

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,719
we all leave out there so

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
we'll start who am i um

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,480
a lot of you may know me a lot of you

8

may not uh i am a father twin boys 13

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
year old boys weed outside a lot

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920
i have a new puppy through the pandemic

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,400
who didn't get one

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
i'm also one of two black hat knock

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
leads with grifter you guys may know

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,840
that guy

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,000
defcon goon

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,800
involved with dc 801.81 labs i've been

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
m.i.a a little bit the last year or two

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
but that'll get back into it and then

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,399
a senior security consultant for optiv

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
by day

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
so again the internet and privacy on

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,120
what we're going to talk about what that

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,599
looks like

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
how often do we think that we have any

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,600
semblance of privacy on the internet

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,879
oftentimes a lot of people think that

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,239
they do and just the people that i've

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
talked to

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
but i think in in most cases

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
the the assumption should be that there

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
there is no such thing as privacy on the

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
internet um

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,960
that data's out there again having 13

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
year old twin boys it's very apt for me

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,840
at the moment

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
i'm trying to to make sure that they're

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,560
aware of

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
the implications of what they may say as

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
a teenager on social media and the

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,880
internet

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,159
as has become adults and we'll talk

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,600
about that a little bit

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
again in some cases i believe some

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,680
people have a false sense of security or

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
privacy excuse me based on

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,119
certain sites that they're at they

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,799
didn't do anything wrong

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
you've heard those terms all before

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
uh again we need to assume that that

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
data also exists forever so

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
again if you put it on the internet you

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,920
say something that you didn't

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
necessarily

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
mean or was in the heat of the moment

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
can certainly come back to bite you

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
and we've we've got some apt examples

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
that i want to talk about a little bit

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
before we kind of get into what the

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
project is that i'm looking at

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
a few of you may have heard in the news

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
recently don't know if you're

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
sports people

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,119
but john gruden

64
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,080
is the

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
head coach of the oakland raiders

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
well i guess it's las vegas raiders now

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
they've been

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
what that reset they have been

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
doing some some investigations on

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
another nfl team

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
based on some some issues that were

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,239
there and they were digging through

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
emails to find implications of

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
workplace let's get this started back up

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,359
now that reset

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
there we go so workplace misconduct with

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,440
uh was the washington redskins

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
washington football team

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
digging through those emails

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,239
they found emails from the

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,920
owner which is not the owner excuse me

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
was the president of the washington

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
football team was a good friend of john

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
gruden that had been sending emails back

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,080
and forth

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
for about 11 years now um they went up

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
until about three years ago when uh

88
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,680
bruce allen was fired

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
but it's one of those things the

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
interesting uh

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,519
it was done and gone 11 years ago

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,120
another thing that i'd say about this is

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
a i don't i don't condone any of this

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
it's certainly examples of where things

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
come back to bite you i'm not saying

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
what he didn't or what he did was was

97
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
right by any means

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
but but the fact that something from 11

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
years ago in an investigation that had

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
nothing to do with him comes up is just

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,799
kind of again an example of what we're

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
trying to talk about as far as privacy

103
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,319
and those implications

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,400
on the internet again

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
certainly would not condone what he was

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
saying or did

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,040
some interesting thoughts about it is

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
that at the time when when most of this

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
happened he was not employed by the nfl

110
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,440
um

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
and then another

112
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
kind of dumb idea i guess a thought that

113
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
he he did he used his personal email but

114
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
he was sending it to um an nfl email

115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
address so obviously they can go back

116
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
look at all of that and go through it

117
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,280
the interesting piece to this um

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
is that there are some people that may

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,359
have

120
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,040
an invested uh reason to to kind of

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
flame another coach in that sense so the

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
owner of the

123
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,918
washington football team is under fire

124
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,918
for a lot of other things

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,519
and there's there's some some finger

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
pointing going on right now as to how

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
the the leak even happened of those

128
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
emails

129
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
again the idea that something like this

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
would happen in a private

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
these air quotes private conversation is

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
kind of

133
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
another quick example here um laramie

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
tunsil another nfl example um

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,479
in 2016 he was projected to be the

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
number one overall draft pick in the nfl

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
so at this time still you know young 20s

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,840
or a teenager um

139
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
literally

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
the night before the uh draft

141
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
um

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
there was a video that was released on

143
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,800
his twitter page of him

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,479
smoking a bong uh on a gas mask so

145
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,800
uh he went from the projected number one

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
overall pick to number 13 which lost him

147
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
i mean that doesn't sound awful in the

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
grand scheme of things he's still

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
playing he's still making millions of

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,919
dollars

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
but at the time he lost an estimated 10

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,320
to 12 million dollars just in that that

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
pick so again

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
the interesting thing was in the

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
conversation

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
uh was that it was from his twitter

157
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,320
account

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
there's there's been a few stories about

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
what happened and how it may have

160
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,440
happened that it was a

161
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
business associate or somebody else that

162
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
was promised things that once he went to

163
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
the nfl he'd hired hired an agent and

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
that person was not getting

165
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
the money that they were promised so i

166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
think it's one of those things that

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
again even when there's people that you

168
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
trust there's things out there that had

169
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
access to his twitter and actually

170
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
releasing it on his own

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
social media was obviously a big deal

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
the interesting piece about this is that

173
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
as they talked about a little bit that

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
he accepted money from his college coach

175
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
um

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,520
again don't necessarily condone things

177
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
but the way that this happened he was he

178
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,639
had never

179
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,039
done media interviews at college

180
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,479
and then basically right after he was

181
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,720
drafted and everything had gone down

182
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
for whatever reason they explained a

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
whole bunch of things basically his

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
college coach wasn't there his family

185
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,919
wasn't there his agent wasn't there he

186
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,520
was basically the draft alone after all

187
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,720
that came out

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,919
and was giving

189
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
media interviews basically

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
never talking to anybody never knowing

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
how to kind of address that and was

192
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
basically spilling the beans to other

193
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
things and again all of this

194
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
for something that that basically blows

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
up online

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
last example here justine sacco this

197
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,960
one's again a little different not

198
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
necessarily the time frame that it came

199
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
to to pop up later

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
but this one was again just kind of the

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
power of the internet i guess you could

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
say

203
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,039
um so justine sacco was a 30 year old

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
director of corporate communications iec

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
which owns a bunch of different brands

206
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
she was on a flight from

207
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
london to cape town

208
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,039
had 170 twitter followers and decided to

209
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
say some stupid stuff

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
um

211
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,039
during that 11 hour flight uh she

212
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
decided that she would

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
go to sleep and when she landed and

214
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
turned on her phone

215
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
um it it exploded basically she was the

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
number one worldwide trend on twitter

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,039
there was a

218
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
hashtag when does justine land

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
basically following her to try and flame

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
her she was fired the next day she still

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
has a job

222
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,960
has gotten another job i guess they

223
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
would say so again it's one of those

224
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
things that it's

225
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
to a professional athlete a professional

226
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
coach somebody that's done that made

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
millions of dollars john gruden probably

228
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
never has a career again he'll write off

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
into the sunset happily with his

230
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,879
millions and and have not much issue

231
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
somebody to this extent though the other

232
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,520
side of that

233
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
excuse me

234
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,919
again has a job did just fine and didn't

235
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,560
really help herself uh in any way shape

236
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,479
or form but just talking about again the

237
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,680
power of the internet somebody gets a

238
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
hold of that a few retweets it gets to

239
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,759
somebody a little more popular and it's

240
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
it's just a wave um there are certainly

241
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,400
some conversations about

242
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
how twitter justice uh kind of becomes

243
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
a uh

244
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
terrible word i guess in this sense some

245
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,919
people have compared it to common day

246
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,360
lynching whatever that is it's an

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,919
interesting concept the the psychology

248
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
of it i guess

249
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
when somebody does something bad and

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
kind of the piling on and people losing

251
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,159
their jobs and obviously affecting their

252
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
lives

253
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,839
so

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,000
a little bit of story time

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,399
and i like gifts so we'll always have a

256
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
good gift um so i want to kind of dig

257
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
into a little bit of what the project

258
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
idea was some quick examples of just

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
privacy and what we're looking at i kind

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
of talked about what we're uh

261
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
what we're looking at here

262
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,959
so

263
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
the original project idea as as most

264
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
terrible ideas that i have

265
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,959
it all started by talking to grifter

266
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,320
we have

267
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
we have plenty of conversations uh but

268
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
we were actually digging through this

269
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
day uh just our random conversation and

270
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
and looking through some uh some jail

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
photos some mug shots of um

272
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,839
a prior

273
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
co-worker um

274
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
some interesting conversations uh and

275
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
and again just as we're doing things we

276
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
have we have our conversation and then

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,279
adhd brains uh take over um terrible

278
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
ideas ensue

279
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
and

280
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
this all kind of

281
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
came together and

282
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
as you'll see here shortly a not so

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
great idea that at least

284
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
started this all so uh we as we were

285
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,720
scrolling through we saw some

286
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
maybe

287
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
attractive people some other not so

288
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
attractive people uh and it reminded me

289
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
of an old site

290
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,950
um

291
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,800
[Laughter]

292
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
hot or not was uh if you don't remember

293
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
it was was you just kind of no were they

294
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
hot or not really it was it was it was i

295
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
don't know the original tinder but you

296
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
didn't get to date him afterwards i

297
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
guess

298
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
um

299
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
and again so i had been looking for some

300
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
ideas to to do some web scraping kind of

301
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
start a project and have something to

302
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
play with um

303
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
without digging in anything and anybody

304
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
can go back and look i'm sure i have i

305
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,240
have had a mug shot on the internet

306
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
before it's not very nice when you're

307
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,959
searching for yourself and something

308
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
like that comes up the worst part of

309
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
your life

310
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
when you've done other things right

311
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
you've done successful things you're

312
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,079
going to go look for a job and somebody

313
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,200
searches that that's the first thing

314
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
that pops up

315
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
we had some conversation around that um

316
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
this particular individual that we were

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,279
looking at uh doesn't have that uh same

318
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,200
it was it was pretty bad i said so uh

319
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
we started coming up with names and what

320
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
we would call a project to do some web

321
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,040
scraping on jail photos and kind of

322
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
point a uh

323
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
point of spotlight we'll say on to some

324
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
of the issues with mugshots being out

325
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,279
there before someone's convicted

326
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
like i said terrible ideas so please

327
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
don't judge right um we did come up with

328
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
a name it was

329
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,920
it was pretty bad so how to rot we had

330
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
we talked about some awful ideas to kind

331
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
of scrape pull web pages or pull uh

332
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,279
booking photos

333
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,000
and then take said ad money and possibly

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
put it on someone's books after that it

335
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,440
was also march there were some brackets

336
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
talked about and some some terrible

337
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
ideas but basically pointing spotlight

338
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
on some of the privacy implications

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
somebody has a bad day gets arrested or

340
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,959
even

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
falsely arrested there's been plenty of

342
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
that and stuff still lives out there

343
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
again forever on the internet

344
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,279
um so again we had talked about this

345
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,399
obviously knew that there would be some

346
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
not so happy people will you say uh so

347
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
so this wasn't necessarily the idea that

348
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,160
that took hold um

349
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,600
but this is kind of what started it so

350
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
so to let you know uh and ps

351
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,040
it's always grifter

352
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
um so how did we get to st con so

353
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,399
forwarding a little bit from that

354
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,920
conversation neil and i were talking

355
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
again um and and kind of trying to make

356
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
sure that i could uh i wanted to get a

357
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
project going and for some motivation um

358
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
so i called our fearless leader and

359
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,200
honest

360
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
because they're pretty awesome um

361
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
bugged pope see uh to see if there was

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,959
still

363
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,160
a slot to speak this year and

364
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
stuck myself in there for

365
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
quote unquote motivation

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,680
anybody ever given a talk before you've

367
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
done a project and committed yourself

368
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,479
and that's how you do it

369
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,479
so then i started to do the research um

370
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,760
so starting this year uh this this

371
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,440
conversation that that grifter and i had

372
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
was probably

373
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
a year year and a half ago

374
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
speaking of pope this was right after

375
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
black hat uh give myself a few months to

376
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
do that i could at least come up with a

377
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
you know proof of concept of what i was

378
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
trying to do

379
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
as i went through and started digging

380
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,839
through

381
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
um some jail photos

382
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
there was some issues that i ran into

383
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,320
specifically here in utah

384
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
they changed the laws this year so

385
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,839
there's actually some really good stuff

386
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,519
that comes out of this it kind of threw

387
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
my project into the

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,040
the dirt and hotter raw was probably

389
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
like i said a bad idea anyways

390
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
but

391
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,959
really quick some of the laws that were

392
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
changed and just discussed this really

393
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
quick in utah and there's some some

394
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
other states that have changed some

395
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,000
things so house bill 228 this year was

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,079
passed and it was

397
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
it restricted the

398
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,720
distribution of jail photos

399
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
so more so than just someone's

400
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,240
past

401
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,079
or or worse moment being out there on

402
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,680
the internet

403
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
there was a publish for pay websites uh

404
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,760
business that was kind of

405
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
taking off apparently so basically

406
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,480
people

407
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,680
um

408
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
sites would would scrape these photos

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
and then and list them on their own site

410
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,639
and then force people to pay them in

411
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
order to remove them from said site or

412
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,480
delete them

413
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
that obviously is pretty much just

414
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,839
straight extortion became an issue so

415
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
they wanted to change the laws around it

416
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
the reason i have the other one listed

417
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
isn't necessarily anything to do with

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
jail photos i was doing a whole bunch of

419
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
reading on this and and getting through

420
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
the the bill a little bit um

421
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,760
there was concern from media and other

422
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
people um

423
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,639
about restricting access to jail photos

424
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,800
so what they did and kind of as a

425
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,359
compromise

426
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
and their house bill 249 was passed that

427
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,920
basically allows um

428
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
you to search the exchange database is

429
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
what it's called not that exchange it's

430
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
the letter x

431
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
but that is a database that the state of

432
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,959
utah uses

433
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
attorneys

434
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,160
anybody in that attorneys lawyers judges

435
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,399
have access to this we have to pay a

436
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
monthly fee and it's pretty expensive i

437
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
think it's a couple hundred bucks but

438
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,040
basically you can search somebody and

439
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
you can find

440
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
convictions speeding tickets

441
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
bankruptcies divorces you know

442
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
everything that we have in the in the

443
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
state database on someone

444
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
so as kind of a compromise in some ways

445
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
to the jail photos

446
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
a companies can or excuse me media can

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,199
still access those they just have to

448
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,959
request them they're not just posted on

449
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
a clear text website by a sheriff

450
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
so it's a little at least a little more

451
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,279
clean in that sense but basically they

452
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,959
they made them

453
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
sign a form saying that it wouldn't be

454
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
published on a

455
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
publish for pay site the interesting

456
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
thing about this and just a quick side

457
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,399
note again as i was reading through this

458
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,880
a little bit we don't want people to be

459
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
extorted the laws were changed for a

460
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,759
reason there's some some interesting

461
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,079
stuff there but there is uh

462
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
in reading through the law and what they

463
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,279
did

464
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,680
those sites can still exist

465
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
whether or not they charge people is is

466
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
where it becomes an issue to remove to

467
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
remove mug shots

468
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
in the in the bill there's a excerpt

469
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,040
that says

470
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,399
so basically

471
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,560
if if you're not guilty and there's a

472
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
mug shot on this site you can request to

473
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,079
remove it they have to do it within

474
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
seven days

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
you can't be charged anything otherwise

476
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
they're held accountable and there's

477
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
fines and a legal recourse there

478
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,320
however

479
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
if you were guilty uh of that

480
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
charge on that mug shot when you request

481
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
they only have they only have to take 30

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
days as opposed to seven and they can

483
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,120
still charge you just not a fee in an

484
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,560
amount greater than 50 dollars so

485
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
the state made some interesting changes

486
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
but they still allowed them to kind of

487
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,519
exist which that's what lobbying exists

488
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,880
for i guess right somebody knew somebody

489
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
is what that tells me uh but i think the

490
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
the the contrast there of the two bills

491
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,839
allowing access to search exchange which

492
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,640
uh their other point to that was for

493
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
um

494
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
vetting people on dating apps or other

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
people you may meet in today's day and

496
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
age we've heard plenty of stories

497
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,559
you meet some random person and it

498
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,079
doesn't necessarily

499
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
end well

500
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
so there are some other states since

501
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
2013 apparently that have changed the

502
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,039
laws i read 18 states had changed the

503
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,839
law since 2013 um

504
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
however i only found 15. apparently it's

505
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
not as trivial as you'd think to search

506
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
uh different types of laws that way and

507
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
obviously the language in all of them is

508
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
different what they may be focusing on

509
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
or hidden in another bill so

510
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
that's what i found

511
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,440
there's plenty of others that are wide

512
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
open you go look at alabama and florida

513
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,840
and it's definitely not pretty um

514
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,960
they're still all there that kind of

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
stuff is it still exists so again it's

516
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
out there um

517
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
kind of nice to see some of that changed

518
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,840
uh for a privacy sense all right so we

519
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
ran into that speed bump

520
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,320
so we had to get back to more research

521
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
and development at this point

522
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
um so to touch on the project again a

523
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,039
little bit what i was trying to do

524
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
this was again to force myself back into

525
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,960
python a little bit i've learned it i

526
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
tell people 10 different times you know

527
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
if you use it

528
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
don't use it use it don't use it you

529
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,679
kind of learn it go back

530
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,200
i don't use it on a daily basis haven't

531
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
needed it that much

532
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,240
in my career

533
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,880
when i've used it i've uh

534
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,160
learned what i needed to and gone from

535
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
there so it's something that i've wanted

536
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
to kind of get back into and have you

537
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,679
know a

538
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
not expertise in but at least a little

539
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,480
more proficiency

540
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,240
after finding the issues with the

541
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
the laws and the the mugshots being

542
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
changed um development and kind of still

543
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
learning python if you will to get into

544
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
this uh it got pretty tight so talk to

545
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
actually somebody else about possibly

546
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
coding some of the project for me

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
helping out there and kind of doing it

548
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
in a modular state

549
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
that didn't necessarily work out kept

550
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
doing some more research

551
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
and found an interesting tool called

552
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,480
octoparse

553
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
i'm still going to be building a tool

554
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,559
for this and we'll talk about that again

555
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,679
in a second but i kind of wanted to

556
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
touch on octopus a little bit was an

557
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,559
interesting tool

558
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,799
um that i think deserves a little bit of

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,120
a shout out so it's basically a web

560
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
scraping tool for non-technical people

561
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,039
and businesses so

562
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,799
um

563
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,280
i paid i think 90 a month for the the

564
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,960
basic one you can get it a little

565
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
cheaper than that i think for even less

566
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,799
searches or scrapes if you will but

567
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,240
basically the idea and what they did was

568
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
they built these templates for web

569
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,360
scraping for let's say online businesses

570
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
that are getting reviews or comments and

571
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
that type of thing

572
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
you can schedule those scrapes to happen

573
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
they can run from their cloud machines

574
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,919
they can dump the uh the results into an

575
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,640
excel spreadsheet or a database uh so

576
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
you can then obviously manipulate and go

577
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
through that data as needed so

578
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
certainly an interesting tool uh and

579
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,919
then the other thing that i thought was

580
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,400
interesting that they did have was

581
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,919
some social media scrapes so you could

582
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,440
go back and pull

583
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
all the tweets from a certain person so

584
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
again

585
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
from an employer perspective it's a

586
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
pretty cool idea if you're hiring

587
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,039
somebody to be able to go back and look

588
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,159
at exactly what we're talking about

589
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,760
octoparse i think like i said deserves a

590
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
little bit of a shout out there i was

591
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
playing with that trying to get some

592
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
ideas uh with that and

593
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,400
uh maltego basically to dig into

594
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
kind of what became the the bigger

595
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
project here so

596
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,720
that bigger project uh

597
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
we decided it's going to be canceled bot

598
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,960
so the idea here and

599
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
terminology or whatever uh

600
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,919
is is interesting that the whole cancel

601
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,200
culture is kind of what i'm talking

602
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,320
about

603
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
again not

604
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
i don't condone don't don't agree with a

605
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,559
lot of the things that the examples that

606
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,760
i gave and there's plenty of people out

607
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,440
there that deserve to be canceled if you

608
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
will

609
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,600
there's a lot of issues though with

610
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,919
other people that again when the twitter

611
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,679
mob the internet mob come up and

612
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,400
somebody's passed

613
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
let it be the past i'd say

614
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
if i was a teenager and had

615
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
the internet and cell phones the way

616
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
that people do these days it would it

617
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
would probably not be a good thing for

618
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
me either we all learn

619
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,760
we learn from our mistakes and hopefully

620
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,400
grow

621
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
hopefully grow so the idea here

622
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,799
wouldn't be to build a tool that would

623
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
go find those things to then

624
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
create the twitter mob or or flame

625
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,559
anybody it would be more of an idea to

626
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
see what you have that's out there

627
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
publicly that you can go through and dig

628
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
into your own public presence there are

629
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
some other ideas that again i'll talk

630
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,600
about

631
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,039
in talking to some other people about

632
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,400
this project kind of came up that i

633
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,679
think would be great to kind of to kind

634
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,200
of go with this

635
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
but what's the idea and kind of the base

636
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
idea of cancelbot so i'd like to be able

637
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,520
to

638
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,760
provide target information

639
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
name email phone number any combination

640
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,520
of that

641
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
and then

642
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
have it pull and provide back public

643
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,919
profiles off of uh common social media

644
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,799
uh

645
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,440
linkedin github even sometimes facebook

646
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
twitter

647
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,960
instagram the obvious ones

648
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
once we do that we can go through and

649
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
find

650
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
public posts now in some cases this is

651
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
going to be an issue obviously

652
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
from a public perspective i'll dig into

653
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,039
it a little bit and see what we can get

654
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,120
if you're logged in have an account

655
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,799
and and dig in a little bit deeper on

656
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
anybody but a lot of times if you've if

657
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,159
you've

658
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,480
sanitized your your public presence

659
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
that's hopefully not there

660
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,559
just in searches

661
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,159
once we pull those posts we can search

662
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,159
all existing posts for given keywords or

663
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,080
phrases

664
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,720
[Music]

665
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,320
that's not necessarily going to cut it

666
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,280
in a lot of cases uh i've i've thought

667
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
about some other ideas whether it's

668
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,799
natural language processing or anything

669
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,640
else again just some ideas to play with

670
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
some some projects and and technology

671
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
here to get some other things going um

672
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,039
an idea that i had there though is we

673
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
could also ask microsoft for their

674
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
racist twitter bot that was also uh

675
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
already pretty uh

676
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,039
apt in in

677
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,799
talking in a in a racist tone and

678
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,320
understanding what that would look like

679
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
that was an interesting concept of what

680
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
ai can do and and what the internet can

681
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,440
do to it so again um

682
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
an interesting story there but uh if

683
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
there was something that could

684
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,840
genuinely uh do some natural language

685
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
processing to kind of review those old

686
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
posts

687
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
again some of the other stuff that i was

688
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
doing already was digging into

689
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,640
maltego and some other ocean tools

690
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,280
as far as what those would look like the

691
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
the transforms for the

692
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
malteco social media stuff for a lot of

693
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
times cost prohibitive

694
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,799
and require subscriptions so there was a

695
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,720
little bit of limitation there in

696
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
digging into

697
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,760
just social media so digging into other

698
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
ocean tools and some other possibilities

699
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,559
there

700
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,520
are certainly some of the ideas here

701
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,039
and then

702
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,080
some of that other work that i was

703
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,679
talking about some ideas that have kind

704
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
of come from cancer and talking to other

705
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
people and starting to to work on this a

706
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,910
little bit

707
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,320
[Music]

708
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
so a few weeks ago i was talking to my

709
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,880
therapist

710
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,559
it's 2021 we should all be doing that

711
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
anyways

712
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,039
and she actually had some some

713
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,840
interesting ideas uh

714
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,679
in telling her what i was talking about

715
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,200
she said that she has

716
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
clients and such that are

717
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,600
abuse stalking issues anything else like

718
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,159
that that that maybe x's are are pulling

719
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,039
things online or um in a lot of cases

720
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
the the things that she described were

721
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
likely just

722
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,039
bad password use and and shared

723
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,640
passwords that you used with an x they

724
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,919
knew how to get into accounts and do

725
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,600
other things from there but again some

726
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,679
ideas on how to help protect yourself

727
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,000
for uh quote-unquote muggle

728
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
or non-technical person other people

729
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,760
um

730
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
an idea from that again i'll touch on a

731
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
little bit kids

732
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,279
again having 13 year old boys starting

733
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,440
to talk about social media it's it's

734
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
it's certainly a conversation to see

735
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,440
what that looks like

736
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
trafficking exploitation keywords so

737
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
again searching and helping find anybody

738
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
else that's in issues that they use

739
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
those tools to find

740
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
trafficking victims anyway so

741
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,360
if we could use that and automate

742
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,880
anything to help those people that

743
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
search for

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
exploited people

745
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
that'd be awesome as well so there's

746
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
there's common places that they search

747
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
common keywords uh stuff like that if

748
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,159
you could provide that let it help uh

749
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,360
kind of go through that that would be a

750
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,600
great idea

751
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
then again what my therapist talked

752
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
about she talked about providing some of

753
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,840
this information so i talked about

754
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
maybe doing a video or a blog post to

755
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
some of that kind of help provide a

756
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
sanitization if you will of your online

757
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
presence and helping

758
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
other people kind of understand what

759
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,279
that looks like

760
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,279
again if we put this into a

761
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720
web tool and let them search for their

762
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,120
own presence and see what they find

763
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,640
this could certainly as anything in our

764
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,360
industry used be used in a bad way

765
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
if if somebody wanted to

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,080
but again to be able to provide that to

767
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
people that don't necessarily know how

768
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,279
to do all this or or couldn't easily um

769
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
search all the info is is kind of what

770
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
we're going for and then lastly uh again

771
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,080
info for parents teenagers anything else

772
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,679
that we can do to help that way again

773
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
providing information into what their

774
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,799
public presence looks like seeing if

775
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,880
there's anything

776
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
that they're

777
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
missing if you will

778
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
back to the exploitation trafficking

779
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,919
from a teenage level and what that

780
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,880
becomes

781
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
there's some some terrible stories there

782
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
that i've i've heard and won't

783
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,760
necessarily dig into but anything that

784
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,600
we can do to help these are some ideas

785
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
uh that that i've kind of gotten as i've

786
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,279
been digging through this

787
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,320
don't necessarily have anything

788
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,279
technical thanks to timelines and

789
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,960
we will be digging in and having a lot

790
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
more conversation here shortly about

791
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
what that will look like but

792
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,720
for now that's that's what i've got and

793
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
kind of what i've dug through so any

794
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
questions

795
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,439
of course

796
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
mm-hmm

797
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,559
so the question is the the pay for

798
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
publish for pay sites and and the states

799
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,240
that have outlawed that and if it covers

800
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,000
the other sites the other states so

801
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
everything that i've read there's

802
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
the laws don't apply in those states so

803
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
they're still charging if people want to

804
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,039
remove that so obviously again it's a

805
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,559
full exploitation

806
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,080
like you're just exploiting people at

807
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
that point but it's definitely

808
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,840
an issue

809
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
elsewhere in the country at this point

810
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
so

811
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
i wouldn't say that we're always the

812
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
first to do good things but but we're

813
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,200
one of the first this time

814
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,130
awesome thanks guys

815
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,919
[Applause]
