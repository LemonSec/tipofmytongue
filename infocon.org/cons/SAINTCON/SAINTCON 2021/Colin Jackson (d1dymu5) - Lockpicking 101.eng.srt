1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,800
this this summer we actually had the

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,799
chance to go to luxembourg so i took my

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,560
family to luxembourg for three weeks and

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,839
we got to see a couple different

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,360
countries i mean it was all during covid

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
but we got to see like a bunch of

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
different sites and everything so i took

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
a few pictures and i want to share them

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
with you by the way i'm a little weird

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,160
i'm kind of a locks blockpick enthusiast

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
so here's a picture of a balcony and my

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
wife's wondering like why are you taking

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
a picture of that it's like

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
there's locks she's like you're such a

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,880
dork

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
it's like no you're supposed to take

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,840
pictures with the kids and stuff like

18
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,679
overlooking this beautiful european

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,280
country and everything is like okay i

20
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,480
take pictures of the kids but i still

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
got the locks there because

22
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
you know

23
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
he's like oh you're such a dork

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
she knew what i was when she picked me

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,559
up anyway

26
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,079
and then you know we got to see all

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
these old cathedrals and castles and

28
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
different things like that so i walked

29
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920
through the castles and like okay that's

30
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
pretty cool it's like oh i got to get a

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
picture of that it's an old medieval

32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,719
safe or kind of like a kind of like a

33
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,440
safe like a casa forte sort of thing

34
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,320
and

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
you know they really didn't like me

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
touching it and looking at the keyhole

37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,559
but

38
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
i don't speak luxembourgish or french

39
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
very well so

40
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,680
i guess they said no

41
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
and then we went into the royal bedroom

42
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
and saw this amazing ornate bedroom

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
where the ancient kings or dukes or

44
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
whatever stayed but they had this really

45
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
cool like dresser with these really cool

46
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
warted

47
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
with cool warting locks

48
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
so i take weird pictures on vacation so

49
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
let's move on from that

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
so lock picking why

51
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
why do lock picking because you're bad

52
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,799
at coding

53
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,200
oh wait no that's why i did it

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
but that is a good reason to pick up

55
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,560
lock picking because programming's hard

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
i'm just kidding

57
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
anyone can do it everyone can learn it

58
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
it's fun

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
physical security can be as devastating

60
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
as like a network security attack or

61
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,079
something

62
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
of that nature so

63
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
you know if i can hack into a server and

64
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
then pivot from there get into your

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
network it's pretty bad if i can get

66
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
physical access to your server

67
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
that just got rid of a whole bunch of

68
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,040
hurdles for me

69
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,399
so it's like we spend all this money

70
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
protecting these enterprise level

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
firewalls and you know try to get all

72
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,038
this monitoring set up and then i put a

73
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
hardware 15 thing on my network closet

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,840
or i have a improperly hung door or we

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
have a

76
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,599
you know we rent our office or something

77
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
and it's just like a cheap not well

78
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
maintained building anyone can break

79
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
into it everybody has keys to the whole

80
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
building even though you rent a floor

81
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
and you want to keep it just your stuff

82
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,879
so physical security is important

83
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
this is actually my gateway drug into

84
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,640
info security i got into physical

85
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
security lock picking and then i was

86
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
like oh there's this whole new

87
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,480
there's this whole area of infosec

88
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
because at the time i wanted to be a dba

89
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,680
and then i took the security class while

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
i was learning how to pick locks like oh

91
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,879
i should do that that's a good life

92
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
choice so i did

93
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,640
um

94
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
life skill

95
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,080
also reinforces the security mindset so

96
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
you think about how easy it is to get

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,800
through this lock and then you can take

98
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
that same kind of analytical like okay

99
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
this is a high security lock but i

100
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
defeated it with this with a toothpick

101
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
or something like that then you start

102
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
thinking like okay what about virtual

103
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
locks and things like that

104
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
also it's fun

105
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
by the way i didn't ask them if i could

106
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,879
use this picture for what it's worth

107
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
they have masks on so uh sorry adam nate

108
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,840
tarkus does he

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
anyway

110
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,319
there you go

111
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,440
tool

112
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
we have a few tool board members here

113
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
actually

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
this is the open organization of lock

115
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
pickers they have a couple rules like to

116
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
bring it up whenever we teach lock

117
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
picking classes

118
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,920
never pick a lock you don't have

119
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,239
permission to this kind of makes sense

120
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
and never pick a lock that you depend on

121
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,519
so this would be like

122
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
let's say you rent an apartment i'm

123
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
going to pick that lock and if you're

124
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
not careful or something you can

125
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
actually break locks by picking them and

126
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
if it's lock you depend on like the only

127
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
door to your apartment and you break it

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,560
whoops now we have to get that drilled

129
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
out and replaced or whatever

130
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
also that's a horrible misquote by me

131
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,599
there the rules are something like that

132
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
but those are the two basic founding

133
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
rules

134
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
so

135
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
all right

136
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
the anatomy of a lock so this might be a

137
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,799
review for some of you if you've been

138
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,159
down to lockpick village we've probably

139
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,280
given you a

140
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
quick five minute overview but here's

141
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,399
some pictures these are from tool

142
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
and i just borrowed them because they're

143
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,720
better so in each pin stack

144
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
so as you see on the right you have a

145
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
key and it's got different cuts

146
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
and those correspond to the red pins

147
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,800
those are called the key pins because

148
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
they're the pins that the key touches

149
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
some some say top pins some say bottom

150
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
pins but if it's installed upside down

151
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,120
then that switches so key pins and then

152
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
the blue pins are drive pins they are

153
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
being driven down by those springs so

154
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
key pins the ones the keys touch dry

155
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
pins the ones that are driving down

156
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
and then if you have a properly cut key

157
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
it will line up those key pins at that

158
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
line where the cylinder will rotate

159
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
that's called the shear line

160
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,919
so basically in picking locks you're

161
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,080
going to try to get those lined up on

162
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,199
the shear line to get the lock to open

163
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,120
now this is a front view this on the

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
left that's what the front of the lock

165
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
will look like you have the cylinder or

166
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
the plug and then you have the larger

167
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
lock itself

168
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
and often you can see like the front pin

169
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,440
in

170
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
kind of stuff

171
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
and then right in the middle is a top

172
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
down view so you'll see that those pins

173
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
are slightly staggered they're not in a

174
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
straight line the reason i'm showing you

175
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,680
that is because sometimes when you're

176
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
picking a lock it's like okay i'm gonna

177
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
put my pick in i'm gonna do pin one then

178
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
i'm gonna go to pin two then pin three

179
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
then pin four

180
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,759
sometimes it doesn't work like that

181
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
because they're machined slightly

182
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
out of sync so it might be the third pin

183
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,919
is the first one that binds or whatever

184
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,240
and then it's like the third pin and the

185
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
second and the you know that kind of a

186
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
situation

187
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
so

188
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
this is really hard to teach when you

189
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
don't have locks to actually like show

190
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,160
people how to fill so come down to the

191
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,919
lock pick village you'll get your hands

192
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
on this and everything like that

193
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
so types of lock picks

194
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,919
um

195
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,520
there's your hooks or your feeler picks

196
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
there's two way two basic ways to pick a

197
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
lock we'll talk about in a second but

198
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
these are different lock picks

199
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
s picks or snake picks because they look

200
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
like a snake

201
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
half diamond you'll never guess why it

202
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
was called a half diamond or a half ball

203
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
they also have like full diamonds or

204
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
they have like ball picks they have

205
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
double ball picks we call those snowman

206
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
because they look like a snowman it's no

207
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
person sorry 2021

208
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
then you have your l rake or your city

209
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,319
rake kind of because it looks like a

210
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,120
city skyline sort of a situation city

211
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,479
rake l rake

212
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
there's also the w rake which is on my

213
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
bios slide which is horrible don't ever

214
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
use one they're terrible

215
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
okay so you need two tools first one you

216
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
need to pick the second you need a

217
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,479
tension tool or a turning tool

218
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,319
so there's a couple different kinds

219
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
um there's these there's some that are

220
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
just like a straight piece of metal

221
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
that's bent there's some that's bent and

222
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
then it's twisted and get has a little

223
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
more give

224
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
they're okay if you're learning but it's

225
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
better to have ones that are more rigid

226
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
that don't bend as you twist them

227
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
there's also things like

228
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
let's see these are bogota picks these

229
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,039
were invented by a guy named raymundo so

230
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,720
they could be either picks or tension

231
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
tools and you can hide them like they're

232
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,919
they're really small they're really

233
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
skinny and stuff like that

234
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
so you can use one as the tension tool

235
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
the other as a lock pick it takes some

236
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,039
practice

237
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and then another are these peterson pry

238
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,680
bars other companies make them as well

239
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,479
so

240
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,919
when you're picking often you'll put the

241
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
tension tool at the bottom of the keyway

242
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
and then you'll be picking but these

243
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
tension tools these pry bars at the top

244
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,479
you actually put them at the top so if

245
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
we go back a bit

246
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
i'll show you what i mean because i'm

247
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
okay

248
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
i don't know if my cursor is any okay

249
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,400
here's my cursor so often you'll put the

250
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,319
tension tool down here but with the pry

251
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,560
bars you can actually put them up here

252
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
and then you have all this real estate

253
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
down here to maneuver your pick

254
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
so that's what those are for

255
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
all right other non-picks this is a term

256
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
i coined it might not be true but auto

257
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
jigglers so for old style um

258
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
old style cars you can actually like

259
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
jiggle them open they're a double-sided

260
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
wafer basically you can jiggle them open

261
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
you can do it with or without a tension

262
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,560
tool pick guns these are basically kind

263
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
of the concept of

264
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
like a newton's cradle so basically you

265
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
have your key pins and your drive pins

266
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,639
you basically hit the key pins and the

267
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,240
drive pins bounce up above the shear

268
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
line and then you open it often police

269
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
officers or people

270
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
you know with warrants or whatever they

271
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,680
will use these because it's quicker than

272
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,760
trying to pick you just pop it open and

273
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
bounce them above the shear line then

274
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
you can twist it open

275
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
bump keys this is a similar concept now

276
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
the key has to be specific for the lock

277
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,519
so a master lock you have to use a

278
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
master key that fits or a schlage or a

279
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
quick set or whatever and the basic

280
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
concept with that it's really really bad

281
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
on the locks it's rough on the locks but

282
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
you pull it out one click and you

283
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
basically whack it with a hammer or the

284
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
back of a screwdriver and basically when

285
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
you hit it in all these little ridges

286
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
on the key will actually do the same

287
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
thing bounce up the drive pins so you

288
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
can twist it

289
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
bumping is very mean on locks and us

290
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
purists are like that's not art that's

291
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
horrible anyway

292
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,640
uh

293
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
shims plug spinners under the door tool

294
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
if you're in my last talk we talked

295
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
about this we have all these things

296
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
downstairs

297
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,440
um probably not gonna do bump keys and

298
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
stuff though because

299
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
yeah

300
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
slim jims or shroom tools lloyd tools

301
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
things like that

302
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
okay

303
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
these are kind of types of lock picking

304
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,839
so lock picking lock sport hobbyist it's

305
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
kind of something fun to do or whatever

306
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
um you know the art of lock picking

307
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
really learning the techniques and

308
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,279
everything quick and dirty that's like

309
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,959
raking scrubbing

310
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
jiggling brute forcing carding the lock

311
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
that's just like i got to get in

312
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,399
some of that isn't lock picking i know

313
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,519
but whatever

314
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
then covert entry this would be like

315
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
your spy stuff jason bourne your

316
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
physical pen testers getting in like

317
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
maybe stuff like that i don't know

318
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
so here is an animation and there's two

319
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
two ways to pick basically

320
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,839
their single pin picking which is this

321
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,839
so you're you have a hook or something

322
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,600
hook like and you're picking one pin at

323
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
a time you're doing a single pin

324
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
so basically you insert your tension

325
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,959
tool then you're using your hook and

326
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,959
you're putting slight tension on the

327
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
retention tool then with your hook

328
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,600
you're just going through and you're

329
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
lifting some are going to feel springy

330
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
and some are going to feel like they're

331
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,399
grinding a little bit like they're

332
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,399
they're almost sticky or whatever and

333
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,519
when you push it up to a certain height

334
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
you'll feel a click or you might even

335
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,680
hear a click and you know how

336
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,440
they didn't go in order that you know

337
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
pin three okay now pin five just went

338
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
four didn't work

339
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
two oh pin one went

340
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
and often times that's how you should

341
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
start you should start with single pin

342
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
picking really get to understand and

343
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
learn the touch of lock picking sort of

344
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
a thing

345
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
and the reason they don't pick and order

346
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,320
one two three four is that same concept

347
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
they're staggered how they're

348
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
how they're done or whatever

349
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
also one thing very important and you'll

350
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,279
probably see this downstairs a bunch of

351
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
the picks are bent you never need to

352
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
twist the pick that's what the tension

353
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
tool is for you use the tension tool to

354
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
do all the twisting and the pick just

355
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
goes up and down or in and out

356
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,640
you never need to twist the pick

357
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
pro tip

358
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
okay the other one is raking or

359
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
scrubbing this is where you would have

360
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,279
an s rake or a city rake or something

361
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,880
more along those lines and this is where

362
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
you're kind of just messing around and

363
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,800
sort of get lucky sort of a thing it's

364
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
quicker but sometimes it doesn't work

365
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,399
and you can't fill the pins as well

366
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,839
because you're hitting multiple pins at

367
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,839
once whereas with the hook single pin

368
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
picking you're kind of doing individual

369
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
pins really getting that good feedback

370
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
sort of a situation

371
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
so sets this is a bit outdated but i

372
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,920
didn't update the slide because i was

373
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,399
writing this this morning um this is one

374
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,079
that i have on me at all times pretty

375
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,160
much it's uh the southern specialties

376
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,360
jackknife

377
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,480
it's uh

378
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
this little one here

379
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
and it has several picks on it and

380
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
things like that and it's pretty good i

381
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
like it a lot

382
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
you can get a full set southward sells

383
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
them sparrows lock picks couple

384
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,720
different places and these are nice

385
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,600
because

386
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
often you'll get a lot more than you

387
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
need like

388
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
there are some people who teach like you

389
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
know get a bogata set or get the

390
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839

391
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,680
some of those away down in the box

392
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
that's the big black octagon thing in

393
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,959
the lockwook village we're actually

409
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
and my locksmith uncle had to order them

410
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
out of a magazine i couldn't get them

411
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,880

412
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200

424
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
let's see

425
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
some sites that are good

426
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
tool.us the open organization

427
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
lockpickers that's a good place

428
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
lockpickwiki lpl's youtube channel if

429
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
you haven't subscribed yet i'm very

430
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
surprised because it's very good

431
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
i like his short format he explains the

432
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
the uh different things he explains the

433
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
different locks and he's even gotten

434
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
into bypassing and gotten into

435
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
electronic locks and things like that

436
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
south ord is a site that i originally

437
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,800
ordered from sparrows lock picks

438
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
reddit there's a lock picking subreddit

439
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,760
there's a bunch of stuff there

440
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,920
[Music]

441
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
yeah there's lots of different places

442
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
there's books on it i mean honestly the

443
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,959
best thing you could do is like

444
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,440
get a lockpick set buy a couple padlocks

445
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
or maybe go to like the di or safeway or

446
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
you know salvation army habitat for

447
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,160
humanity get some old locks and practice

448
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
on those

449
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
and just start learning it

450
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,000
there was this book written back in 2010

451
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
this one is more on physical pen testing

452
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
and all the things it has like one

453
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,519
chapter on lock picking but it talks

454
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,920
about all things

455
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
it's a little outdated but it's still

456
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,639
really good unauthorized access i really

457
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,079
liked it

458
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,199
um

459
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
deviant wrote a book called practical

460
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
lock picking

461
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
he's written a couple others there's

462
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,519
like advanced lock picking there's a

463
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
there's a whole slew of them but these

464
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,160
are some good ones

465
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
and then this new one that i've added we

466
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
have a copy of this downstairs by pat

467
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
watson he does the podcast uncensored

468
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
tactical

469
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,079
um it's uncensored for a reason anyway

470
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,399
on sensor tactical it's a good book my

471
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,680
only complaint is i wish you would have

472
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
called it tactical lock picking and

473
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
bypassing because this covers both very

474
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
well there's colored photos of like

475
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,560
different

476
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
attacks and ways around things but it

477
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
also talks about the methodology like

478
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
you approach lock quickly assess it kind

479
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
of a thing like do i need to pick this

480
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,279
lock or can i look in that filing

481
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,880
cabinet two feet away

482
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
and grab a key that's probably hidden in

483
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
there you know it's it's really good for

484
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
physical pen testers people who want to

485
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
you know learn more about that

486
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
and it covers a lot of things that i

487
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
haven't covered in

488
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,839
this or the lock bypassing talk before

489
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,720
it um

490
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
so basically

491
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
that's it

492
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,319
does anyone have any questions

493
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
does anyone have any heckling they want

494
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,759
to do that they don't want to put in

495
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
discord

496
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,959
okay

497
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
um i have a few extra slides um this is

498
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
outdated um it's it's a few years old

499
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
but deviant had a list of

500
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
high security locks that he recommends

501
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,800
to people um schlage primus i actually

502
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
have one of these downstairs it's a

503
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
nightmare i've never picked it

504
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
best is a brand s-fix which is

505
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
small format interchangeable core

506
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
something like that these are more of

507
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,440
your commercial ones abus abloy

508
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,199
and greenleaf these are actually

509
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
sergeant greenleaf also makes several

510
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
safe combination dials that we have over

511
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,240
at the vault station

512
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
there's a few things like that

513
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
uh yeah oh here's a

514
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
here's a gif of a

515
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
auto jiggler okay now you can heckle me

516
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,199
i said jif not gif

517
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,560
but here's here's how you use auto

518
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
jigglers i mean older model type

519
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,959
keys but basically you would jiggle

520
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
those and you put a slight twist on them

521
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,320
and you go in and out and you pop them

522
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
open i've opened several cars legally

523
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,839
doing this and it's a lot less obtrusive

524
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,279
than like you know reaching through the

525
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
weather stripping with hanger and trying

526
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
to push the button or like slim jimmy

527
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
and possibly tearing out wires it's a

528
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
lot less intrusive

529
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
this is what bumping looks like it's

530
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
very rough on the lock because you're

531
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,399
literally hitting it with a hammer also

532
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,920
if you're trying to be sneaky and do a

533
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
physical pen test engagement you're

534
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
literally knocking on the door you're

535
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,880
trying to get into

536
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
it's not very quiet like you're

537
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,679
kind of hitting it and it's not a

538
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,039
guarantee you're going to get it either

539
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
some even have anti-bumping technology

540
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,880
which may or may not work but picking

541
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
still gets past those

542
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,079
so

543
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,400
okay that's all my slides for real so

544
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,640
any questions comments concerns yes

545
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
so the question was what about getting

546
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
into safes

547
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
um so it depends on the safe

548
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
so there's some safes that have a

549
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
combination and the vault station

550
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
downstairs they will actually teach you

551
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,679
what safe vault technicians learn how to

552
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,200
fill for it and everything and we have

553
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
cutaways where you can actually see how

554
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
to line up the tumblers and find the

555
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
gates

556
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
a lot of safes will actually have a

557
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
bypass key so you have a keypad or a

558
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
safe or something and then you'll have a

559
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
bypass key right next to it so i've

560
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
opened

561
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
probably like 12 or 13 safes

562
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
most of them i just went for the bypass

563
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
key and i opened it that way and then

564
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
they were able to get in and reset it

565
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
my mother-in-law actually uh

566
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
yeah we got a few minutes i'll show you

567
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,840
so my mother-in-law um called me up this

568
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,240
is a while ago and she said hey um

569
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
uh she said hey i just bought a safe

570
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
for 10 bucks can you pick it i was like

571
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
no

572
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
why would

573
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,440
why mother-in-law

574
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
so

575
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
so this is what she did she said hey i

576
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
bought a save for 10 bucks can you open

577
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
it i was like probably not like cool i

578
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,919
bought it anyway

579
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,520
like

580
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
okay are you coming up for thanksgiving

581
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,000
he's like

582
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
yes

583
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
so this is what it was now fun fact it

584
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,760
first of all it's a digital combination

585
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
also the number four is broken so the

586
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,840
default code wouldn't work

587
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
and she's like can you open it it's a

588
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,559
really cool deposit safe he has this

589
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
little slit thing so what i did went to

590
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
harbor freight bought a couple of

591
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,840
um really long like 28 inch 24 inch

592
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,640
screwdrivers some wire pulling kit and

593
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
then this is my boss's uh wifi endoscope

594
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,600
so i grabbed that

595
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
um i had to do destructive entry so i

596
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,200
prefer you know picking the lock and

597
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
then you can reuse it but this one it

598
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
was broken we'd have to replace it

599
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
anyway so what i did on the back of this

600
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
safe so here's the front of the safe i

601
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
drilled three holes two up high and one

602
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
down low i put the wi-fi endoscope

603
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
inside and then

604
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,080
basically i had to use my 28 inch long

605
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
screwdriver things first there was a

606
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
back panel so i had to unscrew that have

607
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
that fall off

608
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
and then i had the locking mechanism

609
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
behind that so these are all from the

610
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
endoscope and then basically i had to

611
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
start unscrewing the actual safe locking

612
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
mechanism on the back

613
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
and then as soon as i removed that and

614
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,559
it popped off this little solenoid thing

615
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,840
slapped into place and locked it

616
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,919
permanently it was a fail safe so if you

617
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
remove that it slams into place it's

618
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,039
like

619
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,840
swear word

620
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,679
so what i had to do was i actually had

621
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
to reach in and i had to push that down

622
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,039
and then i had to reach around the three

623
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,400
foot tall safe

624
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
and open it because once i had that down

625
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,039
that fail safe i was able to open it

626
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
from the other side

627
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
and i may or may not have been a little

628
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
excited because that's the first time i

629
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
opened a safe without using the bypass

630
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
key or trying to figure out the

631
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,280
combination because it was a digital i

632
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,440
couldn't have it wasn't even an option

633
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
and then i got it open and then i might

634
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,200
have been a little giddy about it

635
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
also i only own one pair only one

636
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
t-shirt so that's another thing

637
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
so there's a different method some safes

638
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
have a bypass key and you can pick it

639
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
but yeah go down to the vault they'll

640
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,440
teach you some of the stuff so

641
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,039
nothing

642
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
some shelves and stuff they were they

643
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
were hoping for money or something but

644
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,799
it was just old stuff

645
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,919
and then we and then we were able to

646
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,600
replace the dial with a new electronic

647
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
dial and set it to whatever they wanted

648
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
so

649
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,480
all right any other questions comments

650
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
yeah

651
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,960
a dial lock like the circular one

652
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
uh that special tool on the

653
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,200
um i've got one downstairs come find me

654
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,360
and they also have some of the uh

655
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
the uh tubular locks

656
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
at the uh los santos as well come come

657
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
and find me i'll show you how i think we

658
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
might have one at the lockwood village

659
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
we can practice on so

660
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,340
thanks everyone

661
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,669
[Applause]
