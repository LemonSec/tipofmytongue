1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
my name is sean jackson

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,720
we're talking about incident response

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
the incident response process plan what

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,559
have you however want to say that

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
and i really do think it's not if

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,920
but when so what should you do now

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
because

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,160
if you are hacked if data is leaked if

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920
malware is running rampant through your

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
environment

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
you probably have agreements in place

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,439
with your customers somewhere on some

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
level that says you

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
handle incidents responsibly

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,719
and you have a process and you generate

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,800
artifacts

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,280
and if you say that

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,079
and you don't do that

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
you're liable

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,920
and you can be sued your organization

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
can be sued

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,960
so find out what is in your sales orders

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
and your dpas and what it says you do

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,320
like if it says you notify customers

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
within 48 hours if there's been a breach

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
of their data and you don't

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,320
and they find out

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
they can sue you because it's in a

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
contract you guys agreed to it

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,320
so you got to know what is in your

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,680
contracts about incidents you've got to

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,040
prepare and know what to do

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,119
okay

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,439
i am sean jackson right now i am the

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
director of information security at

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,920
spiff we're based in sandy but we're

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
actually kind of global and

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,040
let's go back to the thing where i

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,439
freaked out because they're

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
distributed

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
on twitter my handle is tarkus if you're

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
in information security and not on

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
twitter get on twitter

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
twitter is where information security

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
happens and where

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
news happens before anywhere else

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
and i am a

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
giver of free hugs for most of my life i

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,040
have

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
unwittingly celebrated my own white

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
privilege and my own male privilege

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
and i recognize that now and

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,479
if you're

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,719
whatever color you are whatever gender

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
you are or feel you are i don't care

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,758
i'll give you a hug because i bet you

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,480
haven't been hugged enough

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
all right

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
okay we're gonna look at a huge priority

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
one incident

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,959
but i feel like every time i've given

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
this talk it's really boring

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
it could be me it could be the content

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
i'm not sure could be both

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
so i wanted to switch it up and we're

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
going to go

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
in reverse

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,879
i'm going to show you how this huge

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
priority one incident went so well

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,200
and then we'll talk about what we had to

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,640
do in the beginning to get there so

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
that's the tenant thing we're gonna go

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,319
backwards so we can go forwards

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,679
okay let's start it's all done

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
well good job you did a great job of

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
managing that incident that took months

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,239
and now you got a vacation and it's a

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,720
misnomer we don't get vacations

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
so sorry sorry to distract you there

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
and you didn't get a raise

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
post

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
incident the incident is over

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
so we have a postmortem meeting

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
we do not point fingers

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
at anyone

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
in the post-mortem meeting

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
this is not the time to say we got

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
hacked because that guy

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
you got hacked because something wasn't

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
working in your security posture

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
something wasn't working in your

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,599
controls

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,000
something wasn't working in policy

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
adhesion

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
the policy didn't have enough teeth

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
so maybe yeah that guy

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
he violated a policy he's going to be

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
fired

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
but you didn't get hacked because of him

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
he got hacked because the policy didn't

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
have enough teeth to stop him

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
something like that

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,680
it's not

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
the people's fault

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,879
it's your security posture's fault

106
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
in the post-mortem meeting you're

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
talking about the metrics you talked

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
about how long it took to discover you

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,959
were there's a an incident how long it

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,159
took to

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,599
make the team

112
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
mobilized how long it took to get to

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,399
where you uh restored stuff

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
how many people

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
the hours they were spending you you're

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
getting metrics on everything

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
because you don't want incidents to

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,919
happen but when they do you want to get

119
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,080
better

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
again going to your promotions and your

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
raises you want to get better at these

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
things because this is

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,720
this is the achilles heel to any

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
organization if they get hacked they

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
could go down

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
so you want to get good at this

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,199
protect that achilles heel

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,000
recovery before we had the postmortem we

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
restored all the machines

130
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
we we brought them the machines we said

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
this is the way you want it right this

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
way it's supposed to be okay we're ready

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
to go okay let's plug it in let's turn

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,039
it on it's yours

135
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
when you go when you restore you've got

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
to work with the device owner or the

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
system owner

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
and they need to sign off that it's all

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
good

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
that it's back where it should be

141
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
you can't just stand it up and go

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,919
ah

143
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,440
saturday night you okay finally we can

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,400
go home so you turn it in you stand up

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
you plug it in turn it on and they come

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
back and they say

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
where's the database

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
you say oh well yeah we reimaged the

149
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,039
machine um

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,639
okay well we can get the database well

151
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
i'm up

152
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
i'm live now because you plugged it in

153
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
and turned it on and there's no database

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,320
i've got a weekend full of customers

155
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
complaining what are you doing to me

156
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
you don't do that you say we think we're

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
ready could you please run your tests

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
and check to make sure this machine is

159
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,600
working just the way you want it

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
because we can tell it's not it's free

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
of of malware or whatever we

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,199
infected it's not anymore can you please

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,160

you like it

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
good we're done

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
now the management part

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,120
of incident management

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,120
when you're in the thick of it when

170
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,280
you're in the incident you're having

them in your staff

195
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
if you don't have the staff to have

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,599
those three leadership positions

197
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360

198
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120

if you have the staff then you have the

201
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,560
sync up at 11 o'clock and they talk

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
about

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
what happened what needs to happen today

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,599
what the long term what the short term

205
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,720
they have all those

206
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
those

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
discussions

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,639
they talk about is there anything we

209
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
need to decide

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
they don't make decisions

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,638
the

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
coordinator

213
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
the the the head incident management

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
person they make the decisions it's not

215
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,039
the sea level

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,240
the c level is going to be in those

217
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
meetings but they're not making the

218
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
decisions they can advise

219
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,879
but the incident coordinators make the

220
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
decisions

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
so if there's

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
decisions that need to be made they're

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
going to have a call

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
with everyone who is is making the

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
decision and they're going to put this

226
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,879
on a slide deck what the decision is

227
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
they're going to have inputs due at 3

228
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,319
30.

229
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,360
the statuses are due at four

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
from supporting technical coordinators

231
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
that is not decisions that is status

232
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
updates and then at 4 30 you have the

233
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
status report and if needed the decision

234
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
briefs to the instant commander

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
what are those slides what are those

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,519
decisions incidents

237
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,799
this is what a brief would look like

238
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,200
if you're having a malware outbreak

239
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
updates all the new things are in red

240
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
everything old is in black

241
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
so your eye can easily see what is new

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
by the way i have a copy of slide decks

243
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
for malware outbreak and for

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
decision briefs

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,000
on sked or shed

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,279
the schedule thing where all of our

247
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
schedules are

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,360
i put the slide decks there along with

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
my slide deck

250
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
because there's like emails you might

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
want to

252
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
copy

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,959
of when you send out the notices that's

254
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
happening so this is a brief this is a

255
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
status update this is what you see at 4

256
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
30

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
updates malware response assignments in

258
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
red black vulnerability threat

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
consequence updates previously assigned

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
task assumptions next steps and efforts

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
incident commander's input next stats

262
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
brief and execute

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
i colored this tuesday night so this is

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
not real this is not from a incident but

265
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
new things are red

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
old things are black

267
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,839
you want to be brief

268
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,360
you do not want people to have to read

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,279
these things when you're in it if you're

270
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
presenting do not read them

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
you the best status brief is when

272
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
someone looks at this and goes

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
all right next slide

274
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
okay next slide

275
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,200
all right next slide everyone have a

276
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
good day

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
that's the best status brief meeting you

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
can have

279
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
so that data should be

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,240
terse

281
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,120
brief

282
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
informative

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,600
just an update of what we're doing or

284
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
if it's a decision

285
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
you're going to say who the decision

286
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
maker is

287
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
what we're trying to solve why we need

288
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,399
to make the decision what would happen

289
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
if we didn't make the decision and who

290
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
is the decision coordinator

291
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,160
then you have another slide the

292
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
recommendation action to be taken what

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
you know

294
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,079
what you're assuming what are the pros

295
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
of making that decision the cons of not

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,360
making the decision and what would

297
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
happen if you're going to make the

298
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,720
decision

299
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
so every day during the incident you

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
have that meeting with that slide deck

301
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
where everyone who's involved as wants

302
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
to be can go and just see what's

303
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
happening this is not confidential to

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
the organization if you're working on

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
the team you should know these things

306
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,399
you should see it and you should not

307
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
raise questions in it

308
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
you raise questions out of it and you

309
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
have things to talk about in the morning

310
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,319
or the next day

311
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,880
so that's the daily schedule

312
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
9 am email

313
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
how you repeat it and this is how you

318
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
make sure that action is happening

319
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
if it's not happening it'll show up

320
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,519
within 24 hours in this meeting

321
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,920
this is how you get everything moving

322
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240

341
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,360
what's the hard part

342
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
this is

343
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,320
everything else you have to do this is

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
the containment the eradication and the

345
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
recovery and i'll show you a picture at

346
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
the very end about how containment

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,399
eradication recovery all point back to

348
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,079
the one before it and they all point

349
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
back to identification

350
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
you could be in an incident you've

351
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
identified the incident and you know

352
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,639
what machine is doing it and so you

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
start to contain it and you start to

354
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
eradicate you start looking at how did

355
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
they get in and then you see oh i've got

356
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
20 machines that have the same problem

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,519
you're back to discover so now you're

358
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,800
going to go back to discovery try to

359
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
contain those 20. and then while that's

360
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,240
happening now you see something else is

361
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
happening that wasn't the same as those

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
20 because they pivoted and they got

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
somewhere else you're playing

364
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
whack-a-mole but you keep going back to

365
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
discover once you're in discover you go

366
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
to containment eradication recovery

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
your primary efforts are on containment

368
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
if you know it's there

369
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
contain it

370
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
stop it from spreading

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
stop it from getting further into the

372
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
kernel stop it from

373
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
getting elevated access it them

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
whatever

375
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
stop it from getting worse contain it

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
and when you find out there's more

377
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
things contain it

378
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
your primary focus is containment

379
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,440
stop it from spreading

380
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,199
eradication that can be difficult

381
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,439
don't

382
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,199
don't be afraid to

383
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
to re-image

384
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,519
if you know what it is you know how it

385
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,959
got in there and you're able to contain

386
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
it

387
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
you might just want to re-image and get

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
it back up online because when it's down

389
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
you're not making money

390
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,720
and i know we all like our jobs

391
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
you don't have a job if your company's

392
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
not making money and if it's stopped

393
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,079
because of malware or data breach you're

394
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,440
not making money

395
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
you're

396
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
looking at a dead end

397
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
get it back online as soon as you can

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
there are there are so many talks you

399
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
can attend you can get sans training on

400
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
the on

401
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
on those things containment eradication

402
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,800
recovery i recommend you do

403
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
incident declaration

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
now we're back to the point where we

405
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
know we have an incident it is a big one

406
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,880
it's nasty it's priority one so everyone

407
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
on the uh

408
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
incident response call list has been

409
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
called

410
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
so

411
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
yes it is really happening

412
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
this is the email that i send out when i

413
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
know we have an incident

414
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,160
i will say it's a priority one a

415
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
priority two that's saying you are being

416
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
notified that a data compromise has

417
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,519
occurred

418
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
and our resources will be required to

419
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
support this incident

420
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,440
that is my email that says everyone that

421
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
has an instant response hat on your desk

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
put it on

423
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
we're going

424
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
i have a summary of it the justification

425
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
for priority one as opposed to priority

426
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,920
two

427
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
technical impact the business impact if

428
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
you can if you can't tell what the

429
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,720
technical impact is

430
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
you need you have a lot of homework

431
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,320
if you don't know what the business

432
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
impact is you have a lot of homework

433
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
when you know the technical impact and

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,519
the business impact every time you have

435
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,399
a conversation with someone in the

436
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,360
company they feel more comfortable

437
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,040
having you there

438
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,759
because you know

439
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,639
why security matters to the organization

440
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,040
a little side tangent

441
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
there is a university a stone's throw

442
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
from here that i understand if you get

443
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
your computer science degree

444
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
they're going to encourage you to turn

445
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,240
around and get your master's degree in

446
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
cyber security because when you get that

447
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
shiny diploma and you move the tassel

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
from one side to the other you'll get a

449
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,199
job for 80k

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,880
i'm sorry you're not

451
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
you've been trained but you have no

452
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
experience you're not worth 80k i'm

453
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
sorry they're lying to you and i think

454
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,440
they're just trying to get people to go

455
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
to their master's program

456
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
you need to have experience working in

457
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
the organization

458
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
talking with process owners

459
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,720
and

460
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,160
marketing people

461
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,959
and

462
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,959
engineering and

463
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,240
implementation and support and legal and

464
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,720
finance and sea levels

465
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,199
you need to know how the organization

466
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
makes money

467
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,720
what

468
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,559
what assets

469
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
marketing thinks is most important it

470
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
might not be the same ones you think are

471
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,240
important

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
since they're do they do the marketing

473
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,439
that brings the money which one is more

474
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,359
important

475
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,799
it's the one they value

476
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,199
at my last job i i got in with a

477
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,640
young

478
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
security guy who was there before me

479
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
and he had a list of all the uh risks

480
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,400
and i have a risk registry that uh that

481
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
i use anywhere i go that has five it's a

482
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,440
five by five registry

483
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,640
and the likelihood of something

484
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
happening i'm sorry we're way off of

485
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
incident we're in the homework

486
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
it is never going to happen in our

487
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,559
environment

488
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,080
it could happen one day in our

489
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
environment

490
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,520
it might be happening in our environment

491
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
it probably is happening in our

492
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
environment or i know it's happening in

493
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
our environment

494
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
those the likelihood factors for my five

495
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
by five and the other five

496
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,559
is this has no effect on our customers

497
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
or the company

498
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,240
this has a slight effect we might have

499
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
to apologize to

500
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
less than 10 customers and we might have

501
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,919
a slight financial hiccup but it's

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,919
nothing to write home about

503
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,840
we've got to contact a lot of customers

504
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
and maybe some some

505
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
vendors and maybe some individual users

506
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,799
and this is going to take us six months

507
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,440
to recover financially

508
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
we've got public marketing statements we

509
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
need to say to the world we're

510
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
contacting the news

511
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
we might have talked to sec

512
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
we are in serious financial trouble it

513
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
might take a year or two to recover

514
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
financially and the worst is we are out

515
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
of business or everyone if there's a

516
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
customer has been exposed and is suing

517
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,559
us

518
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
so those are the five of how bad it

519
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
would be and there's my five of how

520
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
likely it is

521
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
and this

522
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
guy had this risk registry and he said

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
look at these risks i can't get them to

524
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,679
do anything they are critical

525
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,039
and i said how do they affect the

526
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
company

527
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
he said

528
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
well they don't i said yeah the cvss

529
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
score is is 10.

530
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
it's terrible

531
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
we have so many factors in the in in

532
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
place to mitigate this

533
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,520
how could it affect the the organization

534
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
he says

535
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
it couldn't like right so that puts it

536
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
in the top corner

537
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
stop sending the tickets stop loading

538
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
he's like but it's insecure

539
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
that i know

540
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
it's not an issue

541
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
it's not hurting the company you will

542
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
get no traction from anyone to fix that

543
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
because it doesn't affect the company

544
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
you just look like the squeaky wheel

545
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799
so stop being the squeaky wheel don't

546
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,160
tell them to chase something that has no

547
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,039
value

548
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
find out what's of value to them

549
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,120
secure those and they'll be happy to fix

550
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
those things

551
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,120
so technical impact business impact you

552
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
need to know these things

553
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
coordination

554
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
conference call to be held at this is

555
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,360
the

556
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,678
question

557
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,159

there's someone who has more experience

561
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
with incident response than you do

562
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919

563
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
experience

564
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760

633
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,080
be honest

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
and try to wear those hats

635
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
but this is who gets that email

636
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,039
this is also the same group that gets

637
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,880
the first email which we'll talk about

638
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,240
in just a second

639
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,159
remember this is the email that says yes

640
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,440
we're having an incident

641
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
when you have the incident you might

642
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,679
have to release public facing documents

643
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,440
there should be a draft

644
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,960
approval and release process

645
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,440
drafting and approval should come from

646
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,320
you

647
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
from marketing from sea levels from

648
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,279
legal from

649
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,279
public relations from

650
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,600
developers from anyone who's who's

651
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
working on the incident or is being

652
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
activated and they know something

653
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,520
the only people who can talk about it

654
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
are public relations

655
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,559
that might be marketing if you don't

656
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
have marketing and public relations

657
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
if you don't have a second you don't

658
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
have to marketing and public relations

659
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,279
it's marketing

660
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,039
the only people who can talk about the

661
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,000
incident to anyone outside

662
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
is marketing

663
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,279
do not talk about what's happening to

664
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
anyone outside this is all

665
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,918
highly confidential

666
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
i would go so far to say don't tell your

667
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
significant other

668
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
just say one of those things at work

669
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,200
that's going to take me

670
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
all the time

671
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
is happening you grab your go bag and

672
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,279
your sleeping bag and your pillow

673
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,240
and you go back to work

674
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,640
so

675
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
a lot of people have influence that on

676
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,440
drafting and approval

677
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
the only releasers

678
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,960
are public relations or marketing

679
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,000
that clear any questions

680
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,159
okay

681
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,240
when you're executing the computer

682
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
instant response plan

683
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,320
there is a reviewing senior executive

684
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
before the talk we were doing an ama

685
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
i'm glad we have so much time

686
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,320
um

687
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,919
and someone said should sea levels be

688
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,279
there yes

689
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
there should be a c level who is

690
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,360
watching and aware of the entire process

691
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,719
unless you're the cso

692
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,200
that sea level is not going to be highly

693
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,559
involved

694
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,640
they want to know what's happening

695
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,520
but this is not their wheelhouse

696
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,279
this is not what they're good at

697
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,760
but they need to know what's happening

698
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,240
they can make advice they have credit

699
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
cards with big limits

700
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
if you need to

701
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
put people up in a hotel right across

702
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
the street

703
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,159
put them up

704
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,559
say we need to have we need people here

705
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,840
on site

706
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
but the floor is so hard can we please

707
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
get rooms at the hotel

708
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
and maybe people maybe have shifts

709
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,120
people are going over there sleeping

710
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,080
during the day coming at night

711
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
they have food they have you can get

712
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
credit cards with for food

713
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
cut back on the alcohol until the

714
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
meetings until the incident is managed

715
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,679
you want people focused anyway

716
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,840
incident

717
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,559
commander

718
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,720
again if if there's no one there better

719
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
than you at this that's you

720
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,480
you've got the

721
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
incident manager coordinator

722
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
technical action coordinator and

723
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
supporting actions coordinator

724
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,279
they're responsible for turnover

725
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,080
task management facilitation of the serp

726
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
the scribe and post incident tasks

727
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
that is mean they're going to do them

728
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
unless they don't have the staff if they

729
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
have the staff these are the people who

730
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
are going to have some of those hats

731
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
look at the description of these things

732
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,039
it might be technical people it might

733
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
not be technical people

734
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,559
it might be

735
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,799
marketing it might be implementation it

736
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,520
might be customer support it might be a

737
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
developer

738
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
they're probably going to be a security

739
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
champion they're going to be interested

740
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
in security things you want to encourage

741
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
that

742
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
technical action containment eradication

743
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
recovery that's usually going to be us

744
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,080
and our peers and people at your

745
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
organization and it might be a third

746
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,760
party you hire to come help

747
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
supporting actions external reporting

748
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,880
communications evidence management

749
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
liaison with police and legal oversight

750
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,520
although i'm saying

751
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
liaison with police is in supporting

752
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
actions

753
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,679
i kind of want to keep that myself

754
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,039
you should have the phone number for the

755
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
local fbi

756
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,240
organization the person who is in charge

757
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
of

758
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
hackers

759
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,039
and miscreant behavior

760
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
you want to have a relationship so no

761
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
matter where you go in your career you

762
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,399
know how to reach them and they know

763
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
where you are and they know what you do

764
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
and you know what your organization does

765
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,600
and who might be

766
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
targeting them you know look at the

767
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,039
mitre attack

768
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,279
framework and see who might be going

769
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,399
after you

770
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,640
maybe the fbi wants to know about that

771
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
so get the local

772
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,159
find out who in the local police is

773
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,480
responsible for for

774
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,559
uh hacking information or hacking

775
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,159
activities

776
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,720
get their information get the local fbi

777
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,600
and then take care of that relationship

778
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
and don't let someone else screw it up

779
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,919
and don't let someone else pooh-pooh it

780
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,640
and downplay it

781
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,679
when it comes to police and incident

782
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,720
management when you contact the police

783
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,360
if there's been criminal activity

784
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,120
from anyone could be from russia could

785
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,600
be from a co-worker could be from

786
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,640
someone in

787
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,840
their mom's basement in virginia

788
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
if it's criminal activity the police do

789
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,720
not have the same goal that you do

790
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
what's the goal the police have when

791
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,600
they know there's a criminal

792
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
catch the criminal what's your goal when

793
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,880
you've been breached

794
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,000
get back up and running

795
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,880
those two might be in conflict

796
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,039
they might want to gather your evidence

797
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
and make it not available for chain of

798
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
custody

799
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
makes it very hard to eradicate when you

800
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,000
can't when you don't have the machines

801
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,720
that were infected

802
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,559
so

803
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,559
talk to the police when you think you've

804
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,320
got it all taken care of or maybe you

805
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,480
have it all taken care of

806
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,760
then get all your evidence that you

807
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
collected make a copy

808
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,640
get the hashes give them the copies

809
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,080
and let them go catch the criminal

810
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,760
incident notification this is not the

811
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
declaration this is just the

812
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
notification

813
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
this is the email i send when i have

814
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
indicators of compromise

815
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,799
that are sufficient to think we have an

816
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,039
incident

817
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,480
now right there i'm saying a lot

818
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,799
you see things all the time at your job

819
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,520
that are weird

820
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,679
every time you see one

821
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
if you're anything like me you say is

822
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
this

823
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,399
something

824
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,000
or is it

825
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,679
a misunderstanding

826
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
is it a stupid process

827
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,200
is this

828
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,520
a bug is this a

829
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,640
flaw in the code

830
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,679
or is something really happening

831
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,159
so if you think something might be

832
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,600
happening but you don't know it's an

833
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,039
incident yet

834
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
and let me make clear

835
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
you don't know it's an incident so this

836
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,039
is going to tell you kind of where this

837
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,240
email comes in relation to the big one

838
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
this is the one that says something has

839
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,519
caught my eye

840
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,760
and it seems credible

841
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,440
so

842
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,919
if you had the hat mothballed under your

843
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,279
desk

844
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,720
just take it out and put it on top of

845
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,159
the desk you might be able to put it

846
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,399
back under the desk soon but get it out

847
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,360
you understand what i'm saying

848
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,799
if

849
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,000
the parties listed below are

850
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,159
investigating possible data compromise

851
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,120
the date and time incident coordinator

852
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
personal contact approving manager

853
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,120
source of detection or notification that

854
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,519
data is compromised best you can guess

855
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,519
compromise characteristics what does it

856
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,039
look like

857
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,679
what do you see what makes you think

858
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,120
it's something

859
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
what data has been encrypted what is the

860
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,760
technical impact if this is a thing what

861
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
would be the business impact if this was

862
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,480
a thing

863
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
the next steps you're going to take to

864
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,519
identify is it really an incident

865
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,519
confirm confirmation or denial of

866
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,919
compromise

867
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
is there is data out

868
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,679
or not

869
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,080
any obstacles

870
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,279
let's say there was a gas leak at the

871
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
data center and we can't get in

872
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,159
there's an obstacle

873
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,000
and then next update and means

874
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,840
what you might need

875
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
to get going if you don't have it

876
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
already

877
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,120
now is the time you need you might want

878
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,200
to contact a third party incident

879
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,039
response team

880
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,399
you might want to find out what they

881
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,440
charge

882
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,600
you might want to go buy

883
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
all the hard drives you might you think

884
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,760
you might need to do backups

885
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,159
and to do gathering you might want to

886
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,080
get all the cables you might want

887
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,919
crossover cables

888
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,120
you might want to get

889
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
vmware licenses

890
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
you might want to go buy quick go bags

891
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
for everyone that you don't already have

892
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,640
with flashlights and notepads and

893
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,240
cheap digital cameras and

894
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,840
gloves and hats because data centers are

895
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,158
cold

896
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,000
so

897
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
this is the

898
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,039
prime the pump email

899
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,200
that make if that makes sense

900
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,799
it's you don't want to send this email

901
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,519
too many times you really want to know

902
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,440
we're looking at something that is

903
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
really catching my attention and making

904
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,039
me worried

905
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,039
so all the daily fires that come up you

906
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,919
have to put out that's not this email

907
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,919
this email could become wolf

908
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,640
so make sure you have all the things

909
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
filled out really well

910
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,799
what would be the business impact if

911
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,960
this was a thing

912
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
what are the next steps what are the

913
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,360
characteristics of the compromise

914
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,760
why do you think it's a thing not just

915
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
it feels like it but why

916
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,519
what's the evidence that it might be a

917
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,960
thing

918
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,679
and that email will get everyone

919
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,279
it will prime the pump

920
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,320
get them thinking about it and they're

921
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
looking for that second email that says

922
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,480
yes we are an incident

923
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,799
we are in an incident get your hats on

924
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,840
drop everything else it's hitting the

925
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,480
fan

926
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,359
that goes to the exact same team

927
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,079
goes to everyone who needs to know who

928
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,199
needs to know

929
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,639
the prompt is being primed

930
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
so in your technical analysis that you

931
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,159
put in that first email you need to

932
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,918
answer these questions

933
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,079
what's been affected what data has been

934
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,079
compromised what level of privilege the

935
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,119
attacker gained how did they get access

936
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,760
what was exploited how widespread is the

937
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,000
vulnerability within the organization

938
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,719
were we able to detect it or did a third

939
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,800
party tell us

940
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,399
and what component of the information

941
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,159
security infrastructure failed to

942
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,639
prevent or detect this attack

943
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,839
that's the one you talk about the

944
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,280
post-mortem

945
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,599
still here you are not pointing fingers

946
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,719
you're not saying this person screwed up

947
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,000
this person clicked the link

948
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
no

949
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
your system allowed the link to get to

950
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,079
their email

951
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,800
that's what happened

952
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
it's not the people don't look at the

953
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
people like they're the problem

954
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,119
business impact analysis is the other

955
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,200
bullet point how is public safety

956
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
affected how many customers might be

957
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,960
affected by the incident what products

958
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,280
or services does this compromise affect

959
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
has the organization lost the ability to

960
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,560
control or record or measure or track

961
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,599
any amount of inventory products

962
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,839
cash or revenue

963
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,520
this one is

964
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,079
huge

965
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,440
are we losing money

966
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
are we losing data are we on paste bin

967
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,240
are our customers on paste bin

968
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
is there any indication this act will be

969
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,680
exploited for malicious or criminal

970
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,880
activity

971
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
so

972
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,760
could this be uh negligence

973
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,240
or is it malicious

974
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,440
and who currently knows about the

975
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,320
incident inside and outside if there's a

976
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,079
third party that told you if it was

977
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,560
krebs krebs knows and everyone who reads

978
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,839
his blog knows

979
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
now

980
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
before that email goes out is something

981
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
happening

982
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
the iocs oh

983
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,839
someone's clapping oh ten minutes okay

984
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
no

985
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,440
where do you find your iocs

986
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,200
from help desk

987
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,720
people go to help desk when something's

988
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,079
going weird

989
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,400
help desk will start to learn eventually

990
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
when they bring things to you and you

991
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,359
say oh that's not a thing but thanks for

992
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,839
telling me or holy cow that's a thing

993
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,359
let's go talk to them

994
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,200
they'll start to learn that pattern and

995
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
they'll stop coming to you ones that

996
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,920
aren't a thing

997
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,599
don't discourage them keep them coming

998
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,920
because they are the first

999
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
people who find out something's

1000
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,880
happening

1001
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
especially if crowdstrike's not catching

1002
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,680
it

1003
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,720
law enforcement they might tell you

1004
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,280
a customer might complain

1005
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,880
you might have someone saying i've got

1006
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
to tell you about something

1007
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
i found online

1008
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
or the knock

1009
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
or the sock

1010
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
users reporting funny behavior again

1011
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,119
that goes to the help desk or they might

1012
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,640
slack you

1013
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,119
or threat hunting

1014
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
if you didn't hear grifter's talk

1015
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,960
yesterday on threat hunting i'm so sorry

1016
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
but you missed out on a free sans course

1017
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,040
that talk was

1018
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,280
one of the best three i've heard in all

1019
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,040
my life going to all but all the cons

1020
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
i've been to

1021
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
so when they're on youtube if you didn't

1022
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,839
see it go get go watch grifters talk on

1023
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,839
threat hunting it was mind-blowing

1024
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,520
i thought i knew about threat hunting

1025
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,680
and i know nothing about threat hunting

1026
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,200
after seeing his talk

1027
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,119
and in two weeks i'm going to be a

1028
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,200
master of threat hunting

1029
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,160
because that talk it was fantastic

1030
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
threat hunting is the best way to know

1031
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,040
you have an incident without anyone else

1032
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
finding out

1033
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
be very quiet and find

1034
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
look at the weird things and look over

1035
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
time get all the logs get all the p caps

1036
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,280
watch grifters talk

1037
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
he told me about incident maybe he's in

1038
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
the talk but i asked i talked to him at

1039
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
length afterwards he talked about

1040
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,760
there's one organization he went in and

1041
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,880
and started doing some threat hunting

1042
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,440
and they found four incidents

1043
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
and there's a fifth one that was found

1044
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
by a third party

1045
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
but they found four that had been going

1046
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
on for quite a while

1047
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
through threat hunting and no one was

1048
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,599
the wiser

1049
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,240
threat hunting

1050
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
but when you look at the knock on the

1051
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,560
sock and the threat hunting

1052
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,760
anyone else facing a problem with staff

1053
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
i don't have a knock i don't have a sock

1054
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,040
and i don't have anyone else doing

1055
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,599
threat hunting

1056
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,880
so i have job security

1057
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
so now you got to figure out is this

1058
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,240
really an incident we're talking about

1059
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,480
what's the threshold for an incident and

1060
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,040
this is important for legal

1061
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,240
all of my dpas and my sales orders my

1062
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,599
sos

1063
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,160
say that we will let you know

1064
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,560
we customers i will let customers know

1065
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
if we have an incident that affects

1066
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
their data within 24 hours of a

1067
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,599
confirmed incident

1068
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,599
and there's the catch

1069
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,480
i'm saying it's a confirmed incident so

1070
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
what constitutes an incident

1071
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,880
for my organizations if any data is not

1072
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,079
being controlled by us that's an

1073
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,599
incident or

1074
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,400
if i see the same bit of malware

1075
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,440
on six different devices

1076
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,760
within 24 hours

1077
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
that's an incident

1078
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,640
now i might have one type of malware on

1079
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,560
one device and another type of malware

1080
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,800
another device

1081
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,480
that's not quite an incident that i need

1082
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
to go tell my customers about

1083
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
i have my work to do it might be an

1084
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
incident it's gonna be priority two

1085
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
so i need to do the work but i'm not

1086
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,839
gonna tell the customers when it's

1087
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,280
priority one

1088
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,599
you're telling customers

1089
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,839
so

1090
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,359
pci says

1091
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,800
you have an incident if you have full

1092
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,520
magnetic stripe data or primary account

1093
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,280
number and visa says

1094
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,800
deliberate electronic attacks on the

1095
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
communications or information processing

1096
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,839
systems whether initiated by a

1097
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,040
disgruntled employee a malicious

1098
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,880
competitor or must guide a misguided

1099
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,800
attacker or hacker intrusion into

1100
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,760
computer system where unauthorized

1101
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,200
disclosure modification or destruction

1102
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
of cardhold data suspected this is for

1103
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
pci if you are pci beholden yes

1104
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
you need this is this what defines an

1105
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,119
incident for you

1106
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,200
fortunately for the last

1107
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
two organizations i've been to we

1108
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,920
we third partied all of our card

1109
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,720
processing so that wasn't

1110
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,920
for those that's not my marching orders

1111
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,280
so i can say

1112
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
if data is out there yes it's a priority

1113
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,400
one

1114
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,319
but if it's just one machine going

1115
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,640
sideways or two machines going sideways

1116
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,119
or five machines going sideways i don't

1117
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
have to tell customers because my

1118
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,119
lawyers say i don't have to

1119
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,040
this sounds like a

1120
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
like chicken scratch

1121
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,200
but this is saving your customer

1122
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,119
relations and the way you can do it is

1123
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,520
by putting it on paper

1124
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
put it in policies and say what an

1125
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,720
incident is my incident response plan

1126
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,920
has this

1127
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,119
not this it says any data or

1128
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
six instances of malware within 24 hours

1129
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,400
the same malware

1130
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,520
that's a priority one that i have to

1131
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,200
tell customers

1132
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
do that

1133
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,960
save yourself some legal homework

1134
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,680
oh

1135
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,079
look i did more slides about this

1136
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,680
pi data breach or malware outbreak

1137
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,079
this is this is uh i copied and pasted

1138
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,079
from my policy a malware outbreak is

1139
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,599
defined as six or more malware incidents

1140
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,960
occurring in 24-hour period involving

1141
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,240
the same malware

1142
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,920
so that's do i have to tell customers or

1143
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,599
not if it's not that i'm not telling

1144
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,359
customers might be an incident but i'm

1145
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,960
not telling customers and let's be

1146
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
honest if you have malware on two

1147
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,279
machines you got an incident

1148
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,359
okay

1149
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,960
now we're at the beginning

1150
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
we have no iocs we just got home from st

1151
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,280
con and we're at the beginning

1152
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,800
so now we prepare

1153
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,280
from what we've talked about so far

1154
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,160
do you get an idea of how you need to

1155
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,319
prepare

1156
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,480
you need to understand business impact

1157
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,920
analysis

1158
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
technical impact analysis

1159
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,640
you need to know your physical inventory

1160
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,040
your software inventory log aggregation

1161
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,079
ids or ieps identity management computer

1162
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,000
instant response plan meet and train

1163
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
members of the serpent leadership

1164
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,319
policies you train the staff on secure

1165
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,319
practices you need good application

1166
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,560
security you need good physical security

1167
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,880
you need good network security you need

1168
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,800
good vulnerability management sharpen

1169
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,760
your axe come to saintcon go to blackhat

1170
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,920
go to rsa go to defcon

1171
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,520
go to if they're still holding them go

1172
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,280
to utah sec meetings

1173
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,040
sharpen your acts

1174
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,560
get training get certified get better at

1175
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,760
your job

1176
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,680
incorporate lessons learned into the

1177
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
serp anytime you have any kind of an

1178
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,160
incident

1179
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,040
what

1180
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,119
allowed the incident to happen put that

1181
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,359
back into your security posture fix that

1182
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,720
hole

1183
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,440
hire and retrain retrain the staff or

1184
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,960
identify the vendors for an instant

1185
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,640
response

1186
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
find out who you're going to call if you

1187
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,319
have an incident you need them to come

1188
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,280
help you

1189
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,359
and then threat hunt

1190
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
again go watch grifter's talk learn how

1191
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,960
to do good threat hunting

1192
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,119
this i don't know if you've seen this

1193
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,800
before but this is the incident

1194
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,560
management life cycle

1195
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,040
preparation is where you are today

1196
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,200
prepare prepare prepare prepare

1197
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
then you might identify something

1198
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,200
then you declare you have a real

1199
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,520
incident and you go to containment

1200
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
and you might go back to identification

1201
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,280
you might go down to containment and go

1202
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,720
back to identification then you go to

1203
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,160
containment and eradication you think

1204
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,520
you're getting a handle on it turns out

1205
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,400
you don't you have to go back to

1206
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,640
identification back to containment back

1207
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,000
down to eradication then you're going to

1208
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
recovery turns out you didn't get it all

1209
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
the way you go back to identification go

1210
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,680
to containment you go to eradication

1211
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,760
recovery and then you do lessons learned

1212
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,640
and then you go back to preparation

1213
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
the first two boxes that is your job

1214
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,319
every single day am i right

1215
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,480
preparation and identification

1216
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
preparation and identification

1217
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,240
preparation and identification

1218
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,319
any questions

1219
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,839
we've got three minutes i think

1220
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,359
was it good seeing it backwards

1221
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,640
i when i was thinking about i was like

1222
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,400
oh that'd be really cool to see a good

1223
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,440
process

1224
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,800
so you can see what you have to do to

1225
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
have that good process that's the tenant

1226
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,800
thing

1227
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
uh well

1228
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,280
it is completely third partied and so if

1229
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
they have a breach and they let us know

1230
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,119
i can pass it straight through to my my

1231
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,079
customers and say it's them

1232
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,720
and any concerns

1233
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,319
i'll say it's them and here's their

1234
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,160
contact information for their instant

1235
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,960
commander or coordinator talk to them

1236
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,720
yes usually in the dpas

1237
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,040
you'll you'll see you have to notify

1238
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
them of anything that affects them that

1239
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,599
you if you're if they're a sub

1240
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,880
sub

1241
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,800
controller

1242
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,640
so you say yes this third party is

1243
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,319
having a problem there's their contact

1244
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,000
information

1245
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,520
it's not us if there's anything we can

1246
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,119
do to help you let me know and it might

1247
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,599
be they say can you help us can you tell

1248
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,960
us what's going on for security because

1249
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,079
we don't have a security guy and you

1250
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,520
know what you're talking about

1251
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,680
it might be that

1252
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
question

1253
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,359
oh for anyone who didn't hear that he

1254
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,000
was asking about third party credit card

1255
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,400
processing if they get popped what do

1256
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,839
you have to do she couldn't get that for

1257
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,960
the answer

1258
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,760
any other questions

1259
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,160
really

1260
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,119
ye that is so hard to say um

1261
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,280
how long does it take you to contain it

1262
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
how long does it take you to

1263
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,640
recover

1264
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,040
how bad is it

1265
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,520
is it ransomware

1266
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,280
can you decrypt it

1267
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,880
are you get do you can you just wipe it

1268
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
and restore from backups

1269
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,960
well what if you didn't fix the hole and

1270
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,440
they re-encrypt everything

1271
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,800
you're not done

1272
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,119
you gotta find how they got in stop them

1273
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,359
contain it

1274
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,000
so it's hard to say what an average time

1275
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,880
is

1276
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,160
you need to track that as part of your

1277
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,520
metrics you talk about in your

1278
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,800
post-mortem

1279
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,319
and you talk about it so everyone knows

1280
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,000
it took us this long to do this incident

1281
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,440
it took this long to get to this point

1282
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,119
this long to get that point this long to

1283
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,200
get that point and you try to get better

1284
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
and faster

1285
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,240
so i'm sorry i don't have a really good

1286
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,760
answer for what the average time would

1287
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
be

1288
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,880
there's no average incident

1289
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
uh yes

1290
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,040
ddos attacks can now be mitigated

1291
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,920
through

1292
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,760
like a waff

1293
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,040
uh cloud flare akamai imperva google

1294
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,960
armor

1295
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,559
in addition to watching all the traffic

1296
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,160
they're able to distribute your

1297
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,079
application around their different nodes

1298
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,640
and that is the best way to stop ddos

1299
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,680
they might

1300
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,800
like cloudflare will do things with

1301
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,559
black hole in your old ip

1302
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,000
giving you new ip really quickly and

1303
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,200
propagating out dns

1304
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,400
another question

1305
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,640
go ahead

1306
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,520
yeah

1307
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,599
well your outside legal counsel isn't

1308
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,960
security trained they're still going to

1309
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,680
need your help

1310
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,200
and you need them

1311
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
if they are the legal counsel for your

1312
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,760
organization they are the legal counsel

1313
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,240
uh they need to be involved

1314
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,000
they they're going to be part of writing

1315
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,480
the the language in the contracts in the

1316
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,680
dpa in the so

1317
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,680
every attorney i've talked to when they

1318
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,480
say

1319
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,400
when are you going to notify them

1320
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,800
i say we'll notify if it's a confirmed

1321
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,760
breach

1322
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,440
involving their data and they put that

1323
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,880
in the contracts

1324
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,160
and they say well what is a confirmed

1325
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,839
breach and i said oh

1326
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,520
loss of control of any data or six

1327
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,240
malware incidents within 24 hour six of

1328
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,119
the same malware within 24 hours

1329
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,200
oh okay that's defined great

1330
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,640
and then

1331
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,040
you the attorney is there to make sure

1332
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,400
that

1333
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,440
you're safe the organization is safe

1334
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,160
so involve them

1335
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,839
any other questions

1336
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,079
advice on getting your arms around

1337
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,040
asset management

1338
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
it's universal

1339
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,440
especially today with

1340
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,760
shipping devices around the world

1341
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,079
um

1342
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,559
uh

1343
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,240
okay for apple

1344
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,880
again i my last two jobs have been

1345
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,400
almost all apple

1346
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,800
i use jamf

1347
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,440
and i buy my devices from third-party

1348
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
sellers that can put the

1349
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,040
jam number

1350
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,800
in the sale

1351
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,960
so when they open a device it enrolls

1352
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,920
immediately into my mdm policies

1353
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,440
and one of those is

1354
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,839
who are you where are you

1355
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,520
who do you belong to

1356
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,680
so i can then have a database of all my

1357
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,839
mac

1358
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,880
users with pc i used in tune and now i'm

1359
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,520
using another vendor

1360
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
better cloud and they have they they

1361
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,119
have a better solution than intune that

1362
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
does the same thing for pc but it's not

1363
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,000
as transparent as buy it from apple and

1364
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,599
it's already installed

1365
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,920
so i get the pc i install it then i ship

1366
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,040
it

1367
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,599
and that tracks all those devices

1368
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,400
um

1369
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,240
i can go to the it manager and they can

1370
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,640
tell me about all their devices

1371
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,920
the problem is

1372
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,559
when marketing stands like up a new

1373
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,800
domain

1374
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
and you don't know about it so

1375
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,760
you've really got to be on top of

1376
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,680
all the things

1377
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,200
it's hard and it is really

1378
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,760
the primary

1379
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,720
object of our job

1380
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,040
another question

1381
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,440
the ir analysts should be

1382
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,359
they are now one of the iocs

1383
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,119
they see the things and if they see

1384
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,640
there is an incident they should let you

1385
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,319
know

1386
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,119
yesterday we had two incidents we

1387
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,640
fixed them both

1388
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,480
we had two events i should say we had

1389
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,920
two events

1390
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,559
and we localized it and we contained it

1391
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,640
and eradicated it and fixed it and it

1392
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,118
was good

1393
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,040
that should be

1394
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
reported in a ticketing system or

1395
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,319
something where you can go back and see

1396
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,720
how many times that happened

1397
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,040
that might be indicative of a larger

1398
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,520
problem that you're so close to the

1399
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,359
trees you can't see the forest

1400
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
yeah the the lines between

1401
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,440
your information security analysts and

1402
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,960
your incident response analysts are

1403
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,880
blurred sometimes they're one of the

1404
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,559
same and if you can separate them it's

1405
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,880
still gonna be blurry

1406
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,200
uh

1407
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,480
i think it is what it is it's gonna be

1408
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,920
blurry

1409
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,200
sorry i'm not more helpful but

1410
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
you want to have that interaction

1411
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,200
because they see

1412
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,160
the iocs

1413
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,440
go ahead

1414
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,640
you need a sass you need a dast

1415
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,440
and you need something look at the apis

1416
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,400
uh apis are the soft underbelly of all

1417
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,839
applications and a lot of people think

1418
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,960
there's no ui it can't be hacked

1419
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,359
and that is so not true

1420
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,720
if it talks to the internet it can be

1421
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,599
hacked

1422
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,839
and apis do nothing but connect they

1423
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,000
gather data and they process and spit

1424
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,839
back out

1425
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,440
and people think oh you can't see it you

1426
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,960
can't hack that oh my gosh

1427
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,800
apis are the door into the database um

1428
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,000
so

1429
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,680
there are tools that i've been looking

1430
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,480
at

1431
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,119
i'm standing up appsec at our at my

1432
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,119
organization and there's one that i

1433
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,119
really really like at salt security

1434
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
and that does a side car thing in

1435
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,640
kubernetes

1436
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,119
and watches all the apis that are both

1437
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,280
documented and the ones that aren't

1438
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,960
documented or the developers just trying

1439
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,280
to get them to work

1440
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,880
and i tell you when they get when the

1441
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,920
developers are doing something just to

1442
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,440
get it to work

1443
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,319
they didn't secure it

1444
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,119
um

1445
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,760
does that answer your question

1446
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,839
local admin

1447
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,520
yep and they want local admin um

1448
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,160
you need to have your good endpoint

1449
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,520
detection

1450
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,280
you need your good ids or ips

1451
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,599
you need user analytics

1452
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,079
you need

1453
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,520
secure

1454
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,680
access

1455
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,960
because

1456
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,359
we will not solve the problem

1457
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,680
of them having local admin

1458
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,480
they will have it

1459
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,200
the

1460
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,559
security

1461
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,799
is there okay maybe you've heard me

1462
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,119
speak before

1463
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,119
why do you put brakes on a car

1464
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,720
you put brakes on a car

1465
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,359
not so you can stop

1466
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,200
with brakes on a car she can go faster

1467
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,359
if you don't have good brakes you are

1468
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,960
not comfortable going faster

1469
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,680
now if i'm going to secure a car

1470
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,640
i could encase the tires in concrete

1471
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,480
and chain them to a metal plate under

1472
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,760
the under the ground

1473
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,440
is the car functional as a car

1474
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,119
no

1475
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,400
so

1476
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,520
the developers need local admin to do to

1477
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,760
their to do their jobs

1478
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,520
i can't take that away and be so

1479
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,400
draconian to secure it

1480
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
because they're going to complain

1481
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,799
endlessly that i'm making their jobs

1482
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,319
hard

1483
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,480
i cannot make their jobs hard but i

1484
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,960
can't have them be more of a whole so i

1485
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,880
need to have more things in control on

1486
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,559
their device

1487
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,240
more things watching and more things

1488
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,160
preventing

1489
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,680
edr like i was saying earlier

1490
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,799
crowdstrike is a response

1491
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,240
if you can get something on there to

1492
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,760
stop it from happening in the first

1493
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,640
place

1494
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,400
that's better

1495
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,480
if you can have greater security at the

1496
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,839
device

1497
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,040
let the developers develop

1498
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,119
and and they'll and they'll thank you

1499
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,400
for letting them do their job and not

1500
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,920
being the problem security that they

1501
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,880
have to deal with every other place

1502
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,960
they've been to

1503
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,000
there is so often an adversarial

1504
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,280
relationship between security and

1505
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,400
everyone

1506
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,079
we need to fix this

1507
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,480
your job is not to make it harder at the

1508
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,400
expense of the company being able to

1509
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
make money

1510
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
you need to help the company be more

1511
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,558
secure doing what it does

1512
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,559
let it do it

1513
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,280
and do help it do it securely don't stop

1514
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,440
it from doing what it does or you are

1515
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,839
not an asset to the organization you are

1516
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,079
a problem and you are checking a box

1517
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,440
they know they have to have a security

1518
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,599
guy hired but they hate the security

1519

west domain they can do anything it's

1525
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,720

1526
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,400

1537
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,319
it is

1538
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,839
useless to them they're going to ship it

1539
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:36,960
back to me and i'm going to look at it

1540
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,880
and i'm going to work on it i'm going to

1541
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,040
try to save all the data they had

1542
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,160
i'll try to give it back to them but

1543
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,680
they're going to have a new computer

1544
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,079
it'll take a day

1545
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,119
so

1546
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,319
sorry but we're going to pay them for

1547
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,119
one day vacation

1548
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:55,680
local

1549
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,680
come on in

1550
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,680
come on in i got a laptop for you

1551
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,720
you give me your old one i'll give you a

1552
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,680
new one that's not infected

1553
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,839
you're very welcome

1554
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,480
so someone somewhere has accepted that

1555
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,160
risk and that's when you go back to

1556
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,520
legal

1557
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,079
and you say i recommend that they use

1558
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,960
our image devices with our security

1559
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,720
tools because they're looking at our

1560
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,680
data

1561
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,839
if they don't want to do that i want

1562
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,680
whoever owns that outsourced process

1563
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,599
that they're going to be responsible if

1564
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,200
something happens to those machines and

1565
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,680
that data through those machines

1566
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,480
they're responsible for that

1567
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,319
not me

1568
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,160
put that in writing have legal present

1569
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,160
it to the person who owns it

1570
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,440
and you're probably going to start

1571
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,440
imaging their machines

1572
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,160
because they don't want to own that

1573
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,119
but you're saying yes you own this

1574
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,880
and when you do that again

1575
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,480
you're playing hardball

1576
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,200
you're saying i need to have my borders

1577
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,599
i need to secure what i can secure and i

1578
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,440
can't let that be a

1579
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,960
hole you can punch through my my

1580
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,440
defenses

1581
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,599
again

1582
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,559
don't

1583
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,240
hinder the ability for the company to

1584
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,839
make money and to do what it does

1585
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,920
if they can argue that they can't do

1586
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,440
their job because of crowdstrike

1587
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,559
find another vendor because that's not

1588
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,799
true

1589
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,079
where they say i don't want to have your

1590
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,640
stuff on my machine it slows it down

1591
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,079
say okay get a new machine

1592
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,640
you want to work with our data

1593
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,400
you're going to have our our software on

1594
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,520
it

1595
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,880
because we can't let you have that you

1596
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,079
can't look at that data without being

1597
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,559
secured

1598
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,240
and get the lawyers do it

1599
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,079
protect yourself make them responsible

1600
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,960
and they'll fix it

1601
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,280
another question we are so are over on

1602
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,200
time but there's nothing coming after

1603
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,359
this

1604
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,359
okay

1605
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,319
oh in the very back

1606
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,559
yes the slides are on schedule on sked

1607
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,720
i've posted them already

1608
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,559
also i posted the two slide decks ones

1609
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,720
for the briefings and one for for

1610
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,480
decisions and there's more notes in

1611
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,839
those slide decks you can see more of

1612
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,319
what i'm talking about

1613
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,799
this

1614
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,920
i think it's going to be on youtube

1615
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,599
no on sync con

1616
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,039
and that's where i think you'll find

1617
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,240
grifter's talk go find grifter's talk

1618
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,279

1619
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,400
all right thank you
