and

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
i really appreciate it it is i'm gonna

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
if you're okay i'm gonna remove the mask

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
we're gonna do the closing without it

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
kick him out kick him out

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
most of you are without it right now

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,039
because you're eating and that's cool

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
anyway and when you take that mask off

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
and throw it away after having it on

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
your face for a week

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
i just know that many of the committee

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,439
members

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
and many many of the other attendees of

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
the conference

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
are grateful that we've done everything

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,479
that we reasonably can to be safe while

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,439
we've been here so i hope that you felt

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,758
safe

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,200
and as a committee it's what we felt was

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
necessary to help people feel safe

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
enough to come out and be part of a live

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
event i don't have a slide for that

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
later so i figured i'd just mention that

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
right now so

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
welcome back to saint con this is

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
probably supposed to be a goodbye slide

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
at this point

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,000
but

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
we called it in real life because we

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
were already ready

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
to get back to real life

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
and have this conference in person and

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,840
so we think that it's been pretty

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,799
successful and we're going to talk about

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
a little a couple of aspects of it and

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
things and we hope that you feel the

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
same way

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,920
and let's get just right into it

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
first and foremost the lost and found

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,759
it's a really interesting thing that

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,440
happens at st con

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
as we get super excited about the things

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
that we're doing

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
and glasses and keys and coats and all

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
sorts of other things end up being

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
orphaned as part of saintcon and so i've

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
got a picture of a few things here

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,120
if any of those look familiar to you

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
they're currently i think still down at

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,239
the registration booth and it's

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,519
literally the last thing they're going

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,040
to put away

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
at the registration booth but what i

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
will say is that we're also sick and

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
tired of storing these things for year

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
after year after year

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,160
and so

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
as cool as these things look and

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
everything else we're not taking them

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
home with us and so

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
um i haven't talked to danny at the

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,319
venue

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
to see if maybe he'll keep him around so

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
people know they can come back and get

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
them i wouldn't necessarily even put

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
that responsibility on them but

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
if you recognize it that's where it's at

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
after today it might not exist

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,959
anymore but one important thing that we

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,959
found in lost and found

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
is a gigantic

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
sparrows lockpick kit

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
and i'm not going to show it to you up

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
here

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
so that you can come up and describe

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
what it is because

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
this is probably a very expensive kit so

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
if you're missing one please check your

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
bag and make sure you've got your really

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
cool large sparrows lock pick kit with

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
you

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
uh if you don't then i've got it up here

98
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
and you're welcome to take it home with

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
you this one won't get thrown away i

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
mean if it doesn't get claimed it will

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
probably end up being

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
the new lock pick

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,799
tools that we seem to go through every

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
single year because people sometimes

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
think that brute force is how you open a

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
lock

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,840
all right

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
the next thing we wanted to do is give

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
one last shout out to our incredible

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
sponsors

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
90 of them are probably not even here uh

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
anymore they've had booth time and face

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
time and other things with you but i do

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,599
want to make sure that we recognize them

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,400
one last time as we close this out by

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,599
just saying that

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,319
the sponsors are in part the reason why

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
we have cool things the badge that you

119
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
have around your neck the

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
cool ability to have so many different

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,358
mini badges and contests and events and

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,399
other things

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560
get funded in part through

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
sponsors paying us

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
loads of money not really we're a cheap

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
conference from our first sponsor

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
but loads of money to come here and just

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
sit in a booth and be bored all day long

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
because most of the people are in

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
presentations and doing things that are

131
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
not necessarily sponsor focused and so

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
what i would say uh is that if you have

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
needs in any of these generalized spaces

134
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
and that there's a vendor that supports

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,360
our conference that's on this list that

136
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,479
you can do business with or refer

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,880
business to and other things we we

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
appreciate that we want them to feel

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
like they're getting their

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
balance or their money's worth as it

141
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
were uh in investing and helping us with

142
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
st con and so this is our list of

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
sponsors there's one logo that we

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
couldn't put up on here because of how

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
the graphic was there but red point

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
security was also included in our

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
vendors and sponsors we want to

148
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,639
recognize them as well

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
and then there's just the conference

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
hopefully

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,400
we

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
nailed it with the uh the aspect of

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,960
so many things so little time that was

154
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
kind of our sub theme for this year

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
we hope that you got super involved in

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
one thing or another during the

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
conference this year whether it was the

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
hackers challenge game which i know

159
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
personally a couple of people that

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
haven't slept

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
for four days

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
because they were super scared that just

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,479
maybe

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
zevlag or bash ninja would drop a new

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,319
challenge at three o'clock in the

166
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,039
morning for them to be working on

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
uh and it takes takes them a long time

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
to do that there's people that come just

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
to play that game uh during the

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,840
conference

171
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and there's so many other aspects so

172
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
many other contests events and other

173
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,160
things that people were able to get in

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
involved in we hope that you went down a

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,000
rabbit hole somewhere maybe that's the

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,360
best way to put it

177
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
i hope you did even if that was the

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
presentations rabbit hole

179
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,360
and that you learned something and we

180
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
offered something at st khan that

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
increased your ability to make you a

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
better i.t or security professional in

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,080
your field and it's something you can

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
take back and tweak or just improve

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
security even if it's just a little bit

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
in your environment

187
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
so the conference

188
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
had so many different things

189
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
i probably should have been on this

190
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
slide for that whole last paragraph of

191
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
banter but these are

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,199
some of the many things that we had

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
available this year and we hope that you

194
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,319
got involved

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
in a few of them

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
i wanted to just get a little bit more

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
specific and talk about communities

198
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
if you walked around the expo space you

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
probably saw some of these communities

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
and i hope you had an opportunity to

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
interact with them some of them have had

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,280
well-developed

203
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
uh you know very polished offerings

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
even though it was their first year this

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,199
year

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
i was thoroughly impressed with with

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
with what logan was able to do with the

208
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
rfid and nfc village he did an

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,150
incredible job

210
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,360
[Applause]

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
and he deserves that praise

212
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
uh and but he did an incredible job and

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
i'll tell you what it's not like he's

214
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
the rfid nfc

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
guru that you

216
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
and he's he's only 14.

217
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
i don't is that true though no he looks

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,639
like he's 14.

219
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,400
um

220
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,599
in fact we were kind of joking the other

221
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
day sorry it's a real quick side change

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
he needs to grow a beard like compu kid

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,840
mic is what he needs to do

224
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,440
yeah

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
anyways

226
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
just to illustrate even just one of the

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,599
communities they did such a stellar job

228
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,960
even though it's their first year we

229
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,039
often have low expectations for a first

230
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,199
year because most people have no idea

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
what they're getting into when they want

232
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
to run a community or a contest with

233
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,479
saint kahn

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
but i was thoroughly impressed with that

235
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
iot community this was their first year

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,599
also

237
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,520
and were we were happy with what they

238
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
were able to provide and do

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
we're looking forward to what they're

240
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
going to do next year our lockpick

241
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
community is a very mature community

242
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,839
it's been at st con for a long time and

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
colin did an incredible job integrating

244
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,959
teaching showing demoing giving prizes

245
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
and everything else for our lockpick

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
community and so we appreciate his time

247
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
and effort in bringing that to saintcon

248
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
this year

249
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,160
the red team community yep yeah

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
the red team community was brought to us

251
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,080
by uh some of the folks at my current

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
my current job at the uetn

253
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
uh and so we're appreciative of them

254
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
bringing red team hardcore

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
capabilities to

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
to show you tools on how to pen test and

257
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
teach you how to use these things and

258
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
actually give you boxes and other things

259
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
to actually hack your first machine if

260
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
you've never done that before and so

261
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
we're appreciative of them and the

262
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,959
hardware hacking community or

263
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,560
yeah the hardware hacking community

264
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
jonathan did an incredible job there uh

265
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
and the st con widows for those of you

266
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,880
that's kind of the unsung heroes

267
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
oh i i'd love to give you a little just

268
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,200
a little bit more detail i think we've

269
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,880
talked about this before but we'll

270
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,399
capture it in yet another closing

271
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,160
ceremony that the saint con widows is a

272
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
club

273
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
in essence and what it is is it's all of

274
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,279
the spouses

275
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,120
of the committee members

276
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
that don't see

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
their other their significant others for

278
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,959
months

279
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,120
leading up to october

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
and so we call the them the saintcon

281
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
widows and then what they did is they

282
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,640
said the heck with this we're going to

283
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
organize our own thing

284
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,720
and so they did and that thing turned

285
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
into being our kids night event there's

286
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
a slide for that later that you can clap

287
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
for but they did an incredible job there

288
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
but our saintcon widows have now become

289
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
super involved so they can be involved

290
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,200
with their spouses while here and then

291
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
off to the side and i'm being

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
long-winded longer winner than i want to

293
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
be here

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
some of the external communities that

295
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
support and offer

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,160
staffing expertise capabilities and

297
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
other things we have the best security

298
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,240
community anywhere in the entire country

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,079
and it's made up of some of these folks

300
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
over here the dc435 folks which is a

301
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,399
relatively new group but they smash it

302
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,240
the dc 801 folks they've been involved

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
for a long time and they're the one you

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
know these are the folks that are

305
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
running these contests events villages

306
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
you know communities and everything else

307
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
and so we're really appreciative of them

308
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
and new this year was the women in cyber

309
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399
security group and we want to continue

310
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
to make sure

311
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,010
that we encourage

312
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,320
[Applause]

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
females to enter into this field there

314
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,839
is not enough

315
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,120
of that here

316
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,160
anyways for contests there's a lot to

317
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
talk about in the way of contests and

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
we're going to get right into awards for

319
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,959
contests so

320
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
let's welcome to the stage our committee

321
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
member over contests

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,450
lean

323
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,480
[Applause]

324
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
i haven't presented so long i forgot how

325
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
bright it is up here

326
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
contests were amazing this year

327
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
always love to see what we can do uh

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
every year it's it's fun to say

329
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
you know i think you made it too

330
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
difficult um you probably should dial it

331
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
back a little bit it's like no no we got

332
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
this and then you all surprise the heck

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
out of me because it's like you actually

334
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,480
did the thing that we didn't think you

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
were going to do

336
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
and so we'll talk a little bit about

337
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
that so um

338
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
as we mentioned in the opening the vault

339
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
was canceled this year but we did still

340
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
have some

341
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,399
safe cracking going on so hopefully

342
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,519
everyone was able to get through and

343
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
experience that because that's really

344
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
cool it will be back next year so start

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
preparing

346
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
but the vault uh it's it's going to be

347
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,360
an amazing event next year so make sure

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
you come back and see it so

349
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,440
um i apologize that we couldn't get that

350
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
going this year but we have a lot of

351
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
contests and this is just uh some of the

352
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
the more official ones that we have

353
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,720
booth space for and as you know there's

354
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
a lot of contests throughout the con

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
just in general

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
um all over the place people are

357
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
creating their own contests all the time

358
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
so while uh this is um i guess the

359
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
pseudo-official list it's not the only

360
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
thing that goes on here so always keep

361
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
an eye out for that um

362
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
and one thing we're going to do because

363
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,399
we're going through awards real quick i

364
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
know a lot of people always ask hey i

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
need more information on these contests

366
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,959
it's intimidating we got a lot of

367
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
feedback this year like i kind of wanted

368
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
to try that but wasn't sure where to

369
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,480
even start so we're going to do some

370
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
hallway con talks

371
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
virtually after the con over the next

372
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
few weeks months i'm not going to

373
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
commit to a time but

374
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
you should see some content come out for

375
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
that so that way it's you know if you

376
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,959
haven't seen anything in los santos

377
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,560
before and what it's about let's let's

378
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
talk through that and

379
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,440
and you'll see some of that content

380
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
online so that way next year you can

381
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
come prepared because these are amazing

382
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
challenges that take a lot of time to

383
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,200
prepare a lot of thought goes into these

384
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
and we want to make sure everyone gets

385
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,320
to experience them

386
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
so let's first start with los santos 48

387
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
participants

388
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
this one was fun real quick primer on

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,279
this

390
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,360
the premise was you've been taken by the

391
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
cartel um and if you were a team there

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
were two of you one was thrown in the

393
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,279
traditional interrogation room and the

394
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,399
other one was thrown in storage because

395
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
there was just no room um but the person

396
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
in storage is drunk and so they're

397
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
wearing beer goggles um so they can't

398
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
see what's going on that's why it's uh

399
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
it's kind of funny to watch people uh

400
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
try and escape with beer goggles on so

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,079
you notice the vent in the floor there

402
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
that was for team participation to be

403
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
able to help each other escape

404
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
so if you can't see you could still at

405
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
least stick your arms through the vent

406
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,079
and have someone you know get you out of

407
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,920
your your restraints now the restraints

408
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
were zip ties really really difficult

409
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
zip ties and handcuffs and you were able

410
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
to choose either in front or behind

411
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,639
depending on the difficulty uh change

412
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,040
the the point structure so

413
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
lots of great participation

414
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,560
and if you didn't get to participate

415
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,320
just show up next year and start asking

416
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
how do you get into this how do you

417
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
break out of that and uh keane will

418
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
absolutely walk you through it

419
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
but you have to get restrained first

420
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,120
so the winners uh real quick um we had

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
two winners it was a single uh winner

422
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,519

who is the winner for the single run

425
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040

442
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
really weird submissions um this was one

443
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,360
of the submissions

444
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
um anybody know what this is

445
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
billings microsystem 1980.

446
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,279

447
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,399

really cool submissions this year um so

449
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
definitely going to be expanding this if

450
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,079
you have ideas just start dropping them

451
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
in discord um but not things that you

452
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,759
own at your home because that's not fair

453
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,959
um so the winners for this one in third

454
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800

in second place we have professor

457
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,079

i'm sorry

459
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
it was really close but but you you know

460
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
you know hamster he's brutal

461
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,120
great job hamster congrats hamster for

462
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
that one so

463
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,199
uh scavenger hunt definitely a lot of

464
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
fun uh so we will be expanding that one

465
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
so come prepared and i think we're gonna

466
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
be doing a lot more pre-con there so i

467
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
apologize in advance

468
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,560
tamper evident uh this one's a fun one

469
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
every year because this comes out of

470
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
troy's brain

471
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,759
which we all know means that it's brutal

472
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
so

473
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
lots of uh of interesting challenges

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
here the the idea here is you're getting

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
a box with the tamper evidence seal and

476
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
it's got multiple layers of different

477
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,399
tamper evident challenges and you have

478
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,320
to get in all the way to the bottom and

479
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,079
this year was an sd card in the bottom

480
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,759
and read the sd card and get back out of

481
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,720
it without uh any

482
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
trace of you being in the box so

483
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
definitely difficult lots of different

484
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,079
ways to to bypass these temper evident

485
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
tags and stickers and and tape

486
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,360
always amazing to see people really get

487
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
creative with this and i think the

488
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
difficulty is actually scoring because

489
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
sometimes you can't tell how they got in

490
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
um so that's always fun but

491
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
this year

492
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,799
uh the winners

493
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,079
team amathia

494
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:21,760
[Applause]

495
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
did i leave it up there long enough for

496
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,679
you

497
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
you got it okay

498
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,120
uh that's and uh dc435

499
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,679
and i think it was just two this year

500
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
congrats

501
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160
password cracking

502
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
anybody want to count how many that is

503
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,280
it's up there 50.

504
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
50 gpus this year um doing a lot of

505
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
crazy things we had 6000 passwords

506
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,919
this contest has been running for a

507
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,600
little while and it's always unique and

508
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
creative and we change it up every year

509
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
this year it was a mix of a lot of

510
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
different things memory dumps password

511
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
lists etc

512
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
so really creative it was an on-site

513
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
component so you were given access to

514
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
use these gpus so if you don't have a

515
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
cracking rig at your house for some

516
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
reason

517
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,919
then you were able to still participate

518
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,200
and that was the entire premise of the

519
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
community and and the contest was we

520
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,720
want to get more people involved engaged

521
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,640
and and realize how easy some of this

522
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,160
stuff is so a lot of a lot of

523
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,679
participation here

524
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
a lot of crazy things going on a little

525
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
side note um i think it's pronounced uh

526
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,679
the augie

527
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,840
augie file encryption is kind of a newer

528
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
file encryption standard right or final

529
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,120
groups and tool

530
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,840
that was cracked by three people here

531
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
this year so

532
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
very fascinating stuff again it's it's

533
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
one of those hey let's throw it in we

534
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,039
don't think anybody's going to get it

535
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,000
and you

536
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
get surprised no matter what every year

537
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
so we have a couple of different

538
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
winners here

539
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
we had an on-site version of this and an

540
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,600
off-site version of this so the off-site

541
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
winners

542
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,840
we had echo in third

543
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,320
apparently they didn't want to be named

544
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
and bastion first

545
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480

546
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,120

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,080
briefly about some of the saintcon

641
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
events

642
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,799
that we do here

643
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,720
during st con we want to make sure that

644
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080

645
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,200

and so what we do through this

648
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
or through this

649
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
thing that we're trying to do i guess is

650
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,919
bring a couple of different

651
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,360
organizations together uh ideas thoughts

652
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,120

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,559
see is a common occurring theme for many

674
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,960
years probably to come as long as the

675
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
widows are willing to put

676
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
in that time and effort to do it we'll

677
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
give them a break whenever they want i

678
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,360
mean they do so but other activities

679
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,720
that we had those of you that

680
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
participated and came over and just hung

681
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,279
out the hack in the box event this year

682
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
was absolutely lit we held it over

683
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,760
across the street instead of in an

684
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
airbnb clear across town and there was

685
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
lots of people over there

686
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,559
if you were over there in the evenings

687
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
you probably had a great opportunity to

688
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
sit down and talk face-to-face and maybe

689
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,960
even get drunk some of you with

690
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,039
lock-picking lawyer

691
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,320
and such great place yeah thank you

692
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,279
a great place to just get involved

693
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,559
get more or sorry meet other people

694
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
in the community and get involved with

695
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
our community a lot deeper the tinfoil

696
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
hat talks i don't even know if they

697
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
happened or not or if they're even a

698
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,799
thing but but somehow that's a thing

699
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
uh and then

700
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,840
the store uh this year we had no idea

701
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
i guess i didn't have any or much of an

702
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,039
idea

703
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
uh one of the things we always get asked

704
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,440
is hey can i take one of those hoodies

705
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
or can i buy one of those hoodies off of

706
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,080
you and

707
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,440
what we've always traditionally done

708
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
with our apparel is we use those as our

709
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,679
thank you gifts to our committee members

710
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,960
and staff members and other people that

711
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,640
put in a ton of time to help make the

712
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,039
conference work and i guess it was

713
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,960
always been an untapped

714
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,039
resource for us to maybe sell it to the

715
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,120
rest of the uh you know

716
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
attendees and such so this year i don't

717
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
have any official fun or numbers and

718
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
things like that but we've sold well

719
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
over eight to nine thousand dollars

720
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
worth of store merchandise which we had

721
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,990
no idea what happened

722
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,279
[Applause]

723
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,360
and so thank you for all of that

724
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
but what i would like to say along with

725
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,440
that is that you i hopeful i hope that

726
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,400
you found

727
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
that the prices and things that we were

728
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
charging in there were super reasonable

729
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
our goal at that store is not

730
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,120
to make any profit

731
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
uh so what you probably found is a

732
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
leashi tool that you can go buy on

733
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
lockpick lawyers covert instruments

734
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
sells for about 80 bucks and you were

735
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,799
probably paying 85

736
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,240
to help cover our shipping and some of

737
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,320
the logistics and other things just so

738
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
that we could take in sales tax and the

739
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
things that we need to do to be legal

740
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,480
and appropriate but we are not there to

741
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
make any profit it the saint councillor

742
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,039
will never be a profit center

743
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,039
uh for saintcon as long as i'm in charge

744
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,720
of saintcon

745
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,919
because we want to make sure that you

746
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
have access to the tools and other

747
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
things that you need

748
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,440
and that we just provide the opportunity

749
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
for you to get them conveniently while

750
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,320
you're here

751
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
last but not least

752
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
our leadership track how many of you

753
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
participated in one session or another

754
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,679
up there in that leadership track

755
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,080
okay that's a lot of hands we appreciate

756
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,640
that that the leadership track has kind

757
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
of taken on a life of its own sometimes

758
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
it's one of the toughest things for us

759
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
to coordinate with because it's

760
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,039
almost all completely done in a vacuum

761
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,440
by a different project manager and they

762
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,880
bring and they try and coordinate and

763
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
fit into how we do things at st com the

764
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,640
best they can but sometimes it's a

765
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,559
little bit rough but they do an

766
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
incredible job of bringing in good

767
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,799
content and speakers and things and they

768
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,120
do it fairly independent from the

769
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,559
conference

770
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,880
but they bring in these types of folks

771
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
to speak at that higher level that

772
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
executive level

773
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
in most cases

774
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
so that you feel comfortable for those

775
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
of you that want to to bring an

776
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,279
executive or your boss or somebody else

777
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,840
to saint con so they can see things

778
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
where they feel comfortable and where

779
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
they're going to feel community in that

780
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,159
leadership area and not necessarily have

781
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
to go down and pick locks and be like

782
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
i'm kind of bored this is dumb this is

783
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,559
your con thing not mine so

784
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,120
uh we're going to do leadership track

785
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,279
for at least another year

786
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,120
and next year the leadership track is

787
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,000
going to bring in some really big names

788
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
uh and so we'll we'll we'll release

789
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
details and information about that uh in

790
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,600
the coming weeks and months uh but uh

791
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
it's gonna be one of the places to be

792
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,799
next year for sure

793
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,279
but we have such great events and things

794
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,000
there

795
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,080
there's not a ton of them but there are

796
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
definitely those events

797
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,120
um

798
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,559
comment over here no

799
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
i thought i heard somebody say something

800
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,600
okay then uh let's get this across the

801
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
finish line here by talking a little

802
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
really quickly about man or mini badges

803
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
y'all kind of collected many badges i

804
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,279
hope

805
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
those are kind of becoming the olympic

806
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,000
pins of saintcon

807
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,320
and matt lorimer over the hardware

808
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,039
hacking community or the communities

809
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
and such only got to collect two he said

810
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,960
and and here's the here's kind of a

811
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
funny real quick side story is i

812
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,440
designed about 20 of the many badges

813
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
that are out there for you all i'm not

814
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,520
looking for praise there there's some of

815
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
them that i don't even have one of

816
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
because i gave every single one of them

817
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,200
away so

818
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,159
don't worry about me you don't have to

819
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,399
bring me one and and pity give me one

820
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,399
back i'll just order some more from

821
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
china and it doesn't matter when they

822
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,080
get here

823
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,679
because normally when we do order from

824
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
china we're really hoping uh that they

825
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
get here in time there were some that

826
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
slid in just right at the last minute

827
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,919
this year but we had a ton of mini

828
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,520
badges we hope you collected some of

829
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
these these are some of the more

830
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
official ones but this is not a complete

831
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,279
list and so hopefully you go home with

832
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,720
some really fun and interesting things

833
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,520
to explore and solder and and and put

834
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,720
together

835
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,919
and we're actually looking to inc or to

836
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,200
expand

837
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,120
many badges next year

838
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
if you haven't had an opportunity to

839
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
look on our youtube channel compu kid

840
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,000
mike but last year did an incredible

841
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
video or a training on how to build mini

842
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,679
badges

843
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,080
and i'll be very honest and say i mean i

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,600
said this in the earlier talk so if it's

845
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,559
repetitive i apologize but before this

846
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,799
year i had never designed a mini badge

847
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,559
in my life

848
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
and so if i can do it by watching a

849
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
couple of videos getting my youtube

850
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
university circuit and mini badge

851
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,159
or you yeah

852
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,600
you can too it is approachable it's not

853
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,960
super hard

854
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
and it just takes a little bit of

855
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
thought and a little bit of energy and

856
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
you can come up with some incredibly

857
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
cool designs and things i'm sure you

858
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,720
probably have oh wouldn't it be great if

859
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,559
i would love to see what that mini badge

860
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,600
looks like next year so please we this

861
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
is going to be a thing for

862
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
decades to come and we're encouraging

863
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,360
you to bring your own and do some

864
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,600
trading and use that as your your your

865
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
method of

866
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,880
introducing yourself to others and

867
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,720
trading pins and and building your

868
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
community

869
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,799
uh and then the last couple of things it

870
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,600
would not be appropriate for us to not

871
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,919
talk about the badge but i am not the

872
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,519

it goes

914
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,919
yeah it kind of works if you put the

915
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,200
connectors on the back of the board but

916

[Applause]

925

he does an amazing job and as we talked

926
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,799
about in our opening ceremonies

927
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,120
we are honored to have the same person

928
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,519
that is selected to do the illustrious

929
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,120
defcon badge

930
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,600
as part of saintcon in fact we had him

931
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,039
first

932
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,559
and i'll tell just a real quick story if

933
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,080
that's okay um not to extend time but uh

934
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,200
it was

935
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
we start planning for saint con in

936
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
january

937
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,600
on most years

938
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
uh january february time frame and i

939
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
think this last year was march

940
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,039
that i get this call from compukid mike

941
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
and he says hey by the way

942
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,399
we put in

943
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,040
a response to the call for badge makers

944
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,399
at def con and we've been selected

945
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,320
and uh

946
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
i i'm not sure if they even knew how big

947
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,359
of a deal that was

948
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,560
but

949
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,000
they've had a really super long year of

950
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,918
badge life

951
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,280
because they literally went from march

952
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,560
through august on defcon and then from

953
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,159
august through october on saint con and

954
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,119
they have literally not stopped

955
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
badging

956
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,839
and so

957
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,800
our deepest appreciation to your time i

958
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
know that that take took a lot of time

959
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
from their family

960
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,119
and

961
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,000
and

962
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
all of the other things that you should

963
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,520
and could be doing differently but we

964
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,119
are deeply honored to have you as part

965
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,000
of our community and to have you as part

966
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
of our bad or have you as our badge

967
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,640
maker and i think we've got him

968
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
committed to next year i probably would

969
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
be surprised if he's not

970
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
but i just wanted to make sure that the

971
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,079
applause that you got a moment ago is

972
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,760
echoed with my

973
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,680
uh sincere thank you

974
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,130
for all that you have done

975
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:38,880
[Applause]

976
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
all right we're almost across the finish

977
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
line here last few slides

978
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,480
it would i would be uh

979
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,640
yeah let's just say it would be silly

980
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
for me to not mention and talk about our

981
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,280
incredible keynotes this year

982
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,000
we felt like it was time

983
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,720
and well let me step back story time

984
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,440
again just for a moment

985
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,079
keynotes are something that sometimes we

986
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,480
at st con struggle with

987
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,520
we're this really cool community con

988
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,280
it's fun it's interesting and

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,240
ironically or maybe it's a good thing

990
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,359
saint kahn is somewhat well known in the

991
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,440
cyber security hacker community is a

992
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
conference that sort of exists and maybe

993
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,000
it's in utah

994
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,760
but when you call up somebody and you

995
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,000
say hey can you come keynote for us at

996
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
saintcon they're like

997
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
what is that

998
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and so what i what i'll say is sometimes

999
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
we struggle in trying to tell our story

1000
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,400
we don't bring in often big names

1001
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
because we're this small con we don't

1002
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,839
have a huge two hundred thousand dollar

1003
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,280
keynote budget that we can pay

1004
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,520
honorariums for and things

1005
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
and so when we get to have an

1006
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,960
opportunity like we did this year to

1007
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,320
have somebody like the lock-picking

1008
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,359
lawyer

1009
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,000
come in and talk in fact i've got a

1010
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,680
slide for this i should be talking about

1011
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,280
during the slide but to have somebody

1012
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,160
like the lock-picking lawyer come in

1013
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,960
and

1014
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,599
essentially donate a lot of his time and

1015
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,320
energy and and expertise

1016
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
to come here and do something that he's

1017
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,040
not done at any conference ever before

1018
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,000
uh and have him be here is a great honor

1019
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
for us and we're scared to death on how

1020
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,440
we

1021
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,000
up it again next year

1022
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
so what i'll say and kind of as we go

1023
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,400
through and close this out

1024
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
if you've got ideas and if you've got

1025
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
connections

1026
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
we're interested in in making sure that

1027
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,640
we make those connections now we're

1028
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
starting to get more and more

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
connections i mean many of us attend

1030
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,480
defcon and black hat and we get some of

1031
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,079
these connections but sometimes it's a

1032
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,480
little bit tough but we were honored and

1033
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,839
it was a great pleasure to have the

1034
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,160
lockpicking lawyer with us this year uh

1035
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,640
he's not here he left early this morning

1036
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,960
maybe i mean he might still be in his

1037
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,160
room

1038
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,320
um but

1039
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,640
and nobody here's the thing there are

1040
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,359
now

1041
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,520
way more people who knows what he looks

1042
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,480
like

1043
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,119
uh because he he he felt so comfortable

1044
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
with us and our community

1045
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,359
that he didn't feel like anonymity for

1046
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,079
this group was an important thing and so

1047
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,480
if you met or ran into him around the

1048
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,280
conference he's extremely approachable

1049
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,359
he'll talk to you about anything

1050
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,359
but we got to sit down with him for

1051
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,920
hours and hours at the heart or the hack

1052
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,680
in the box event

1053
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,599
and such so we are we extend our

our you know again a real quick story

1064
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,359
time on this one i think i mentioned it

1065
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,079
at least a bit in the opener

1066
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,040
this was a keynote that was on par with

1067
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,560
any other keynote that we've ever had at

1068
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,680
saintcon but it was prepared a couple

1069
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,440
hours before it was given

1070
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
because we had snow who

1071
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,160
unfortunately got sick and wasn't able

1072
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,000
to attend but we felt like we couldn't

1073
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,839
just do it with one keynote we had to

1074
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,200
have a second one and james pope being

1075
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,040
one of the smartest men i've ever known

1076
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,320
in my life and a great friend and just

1077
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
incredibly talented we lent or we leaned

1078
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
on him just a little bit to go outside

1079
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,440
of his element and to deliver a keynote

1080
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
and he did it spot on where we

1081
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,960
appreciate him being involved and being

1082
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,320

1084
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,839

1090

and such but we have never in all of our

1091

1100
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560

1101
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720

1102

but at this point i want to say thank

1104
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,680
you to them for their partnership with

1105
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,599
us because when we offer drinks out here

1106

1109
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
that comes from a partnership that we

1110
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,839
have with the venue that's willing to

1111
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,520
give those to us at a price that makes

1112
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
it reasonable for us to be able to do it

1113
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,200
it's something we've done traditionally

1114
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,440
at st con for a long time they made it

1115
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
possible and it's not just that but it's

1116
