1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,799
okay we're good on

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,080
check check there we go

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,240
welcome

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
if you came to learn how to hack

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,400
metasploit this is the wrong class

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,160
we are talking about software-defined

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
radio

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,039
excellent

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
and i think this is the fullest room as

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
for this is my fifth year presenting at

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
st conn i think it's my fullest room

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
i've ever had so

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,240
go clown world i'm glad i'm glad you're

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,519
all here

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,320
thanks for coming uh can we give john

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,920
and ben a round of applause for running

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
this whole thing back here

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,760
they're killing it

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
they're doing great awesome well thanks

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,920
for coming um we're going to talk about

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
some

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
rf uh we're probably a little more on

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
the 101 side than we are on the advanced

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
side but uh

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
i'll field questions and answer as much

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
stuff as i can

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
so does anybody know what this is

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
the russian woodpecker that's absolutely

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,640
right i heard somebody over here say do

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
guy i think as well

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
so this is the um over the horizon radar

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
that the soviets came up with to

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
try to determine early missile launches

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
from the west

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
back during the cold war and when they

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,759
turned it on it blew out all frequencies

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
in kind of the shortwave

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
area so i mean this thing's large you

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
can see that building kind of down in

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
the foreground there that's like a

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
five-story building

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,479
and then you can and compare that those

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
trees are like full-on trees like this

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,799
is a pretty recent photo i would say

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
late 90s probably and

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
i mean the soviet union hasn't really

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,079
manicured their area in a long time so

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
those trees are full height trees and

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
then you see how tall that thing is this

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
is about and sorry i'm like obsessed

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,880
with this thing so you're getting a

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
little more and you want it but um

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
this is about a kilometer from

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
chernobyl's chernobyl

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
yeah not great um the show's great

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
though watch that if you haven't uh

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
they were worried about this rusting and

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
falling and causing micro quakes that

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
would break the concrete

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
encasement over that was previously over

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
um reactor 3 at chernobyl the one that

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
melted down now they're building a whole

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
metal structure over top of it it's a

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,959
little bit more secure now but this

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,519
thing is large anyway it might be the

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
biggest radio antenna in the history of

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
the world i'm guessing it is

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
anyone want to prove that wrong let me

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,400
know

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
it's it's big and it's got its little

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,920
brother over there i think that was the

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
predecessor but and it needed so much

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
power

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
it was built close to chernobyl which

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,160
was the power plant so it it broadcasts

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
about 10 megawatts which

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,519
if you're familiar your little handheld

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
ham radio walkie-talkie is anywhere from

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
like two to five

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
six or seven if you're like breaking the

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,239
rules but

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
uh

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,000
and

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
that's watts

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
right that's five or six watts this is

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,519
10 megawatts it was giant anyway

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,319
so this thing's cool it's not not in

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
production anymore it's been

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,519
decommissioned

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
uh but super cool a lot of steel there

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
anyway

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
so my name is eric vicker

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
i work at a place called moss adams

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
mainly an accounting firm we do some it

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
audit i run the pen testing practice

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,319
there

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
i like cycling hacking i like cars

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
i went to uvsc before it was something a

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
new uvu

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
uh masters at university of london if

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
anybody's byu student by students

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
yeah don't be ashamed um

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
uh i teach adjunct there and this winner

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
i'm teaching a class called cyber risk

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
assessment which is really just hacking

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
i decided to give it a nice name so the

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
admin will let it flip through

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
some search there's my contact info

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
anyway

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,799
let's get going okay so the

111
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,879
electromagnetic spectrum is basically

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
just

113
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,560
uh i mean includes light it includes

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
this whole range if you can see from the

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
very end there it starts at zero and

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
goes all the way to um

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,358
i don't know past light basically

118
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
it's measured in hertz a hert is

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
something that happens one hert is once

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,440
per second so

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,919
frequencies are measured in

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
how many how many times the wave

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
oscillates okay electromagnetic waves

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,199
are just waves nothing too special

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
so how many times that moves in a second

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,479
is the frequency

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,680
so

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
wi-fi is 2.45 gigahertz that's pretty

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
fast and it's a small wave we're gonna

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
talk more about that

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
uh it's a broadcast medium what does

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,120
that mean

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,160
you can't

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
you can't just send it to i can't just

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
send it to you

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,840
i can send this to

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
you i can't send a message from myself

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
to yourself

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,039
because all of you will also get it

140
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
because it bleeds out it's just it's a

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,560
broadcast right i have to protect that

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
communication if i want it to just go to

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
you and have you just receive it

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
so it's a broadcast medium it goes out

145
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
uh it's kind of wild west right it goes

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
out everywhere just kind of spray it all

147
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
over the place

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
um

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,960
it moves the speed of light which is

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
pretty fast

151
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
uh as we know the speed of light is in

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
miles per hour

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,919
miles per second that's right you're

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
both right 186 000 miles per second so

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
that's pretty speedy right

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
uh we can modify it so we can carry data

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
obviously everybody uses wi-fi bluetooth

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
all those things are on rf

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
carry data this

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
is a big old convoluted

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
diagram not in english because i thought

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
it made it more confusing because it

163
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
wasn't in english

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,440
of kind of the electromagnetic spectrum

165
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
we're not going to spend any time on

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
that this is even more convoluted

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
and this is the united states fcc banned

168
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,440
plan which means what they said these

169
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
frequency

170
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
bands or areas are going to be used for

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,840
these specific things that's even more

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,479
convoluted so

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,600
this doesn't have anything to do with

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
receiving because you can receive any

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
time on anything you're not causing any

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
trouble when you're going to broadcast

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
you have to basically check okay what am

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,319
i broadcasting on is it interfering with

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,639
anybody or the fcc might get grumpy with

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
you okay

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
um

182
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,120
we covered some of this already

183
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
broadcast to as many recipients as can

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
in range

185
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
uh

186
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
for a long time they didn't know where

187
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,400
the russian woodpecker was

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
because it would come on in bursts and

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
then would turn off

190
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
so they would have to catch it and kind

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,080
of triangulate it eventually they

192
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
figured it out nato actually knew this

193
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
was built but

194
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
apparently it was top secret

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
so

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
anyway eventually figured out was in

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
russia got nicknamed the russian

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
woodpecker uh but even that that's a

199
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,919
giant

200
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
signal 10 megawatts blowing out all

201
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
kinds of short wave across uh

202
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
basically across most of the planet and

203
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
they still had a took a minute to figure

204
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
out where it was coming from

205
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
the other thing is it's impossible to

206
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
determine who is receiving this signal

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,479
because it's a broadcast

208
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,319
um if you guys before um

209
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,360
like

210
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,960
cord cutting for cable right nielsen

211
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
media research would install

212
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
little tv tuners inside people's tvs to

213
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,759
figure out what they're watching so they

214
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,280
could get ratings and report those

215
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
ratings back to networks and advertisers

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,960
that kind of thing that's how hard it is

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,319
to to figure out who's getting it they

218
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
actually have to put something in the tv

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
to figure out what they're now on now

220
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,880
that we're on netflix and amazon they

221
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
have i'm sure awesome data who's

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
watching what um they know what you are

223
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
watching i don't know if you want your

224
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,240
mom finding out about that but that's

225
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
fine so

226
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
um

227
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,879
layer one

228
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
it's just pulses on a wave right we're

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
just changing the how the wave is shaped

230
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
how far it moves and uh and then we're

231
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
going to interpret that as data we put

232
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
it on as data comes off so just like

233
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,759
uh cat5 you've got you know electrical

234
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,680
pulses these are just a wave a little

235
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
bit slower than

236
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
uh a wire because it's um

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
over the air right still at the speed of

238
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
light which is similar to cat fight

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,039
actually it's just short of the speed of

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,479
light but

241
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
um you have to catch so many waves to

242
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,599
get the data where on a on a direct

243
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
connection or a wire you've got

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,599
the exact um pulses right zero or one

245
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
okay

246
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,879
maybe

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,240
oop there we go

248
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
okay so obviously rf used in the wild

249
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
we've got on wi-fi bluetooth everybody

250
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,750
uses those right

251
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,200
[Music]

252
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
fm radio satellites your cell phone

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
at your house so this is my power meter

254
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,800
it is bolted to my house

255
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
what happens if

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
so it's it's rf they come and drive a

257
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
truck around and

258
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,959
um

259
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
i believe this creates some sort of a

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
mesh network with my neighbors and then

261
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,560
reports back in chunks to the trucks so

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
if that developed some sort of a

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
vulnerability

264
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,200
where somebody could read or modify my

265
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,040
data would that have any kind of impact

266
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,560
yeah and it's pretty sticky right like

267
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
that things i don't know how much those

268
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
cost i think they replace those when

269
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
they put those in for free anybody any

270
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
other provo residents i'm sure they just

271
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
swapped those out for us so they could

272
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,959
collect them easier collect the data

273
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
easier but

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
um

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,519
i assume three or four hundred bucks

276
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,000
right for just the parts and then

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
uh

278
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
i don't i don't really see those guys

279
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
walking up and doing software firmware

280
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,200
updates to my power meter

281
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
so

282
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,240
when was the last time

283
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
eaton and itron got together and had a

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
pen test on their rf

285
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
data encryption i don't know

286
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
and maybe nobody cares i don't know i

287
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
care but this is bolted to my water main

288
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
so

289
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
same same deal that measure my water

290
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
usage by driving a truck around

291
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
a little antenna on top of the

292
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
cover that covers this up but again

293
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,160
pretty sticky this doesn't actuate any

294
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
water main or anything like that so

295
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
there's no kind of physical attack but

296
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
still data there data we can grab

297
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,720
there are

298
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
we'll talk about a little bit more in a

299
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
minute but uh

300
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
i mean there are meters that have broken

301
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
encoding not broken i guess people have

302
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
broken the encoding to

303
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,480
to grab that data so

304
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,519
it could be interesting could be

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
interesting to um

306
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
the one library i read about on these

307
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
was the guy said he wanted to to

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
troubleshoot a leak in his house so he

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,519
wanted to gather the data for himself so

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
then he could determine where the leak

311
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
was coming from but

312
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
you could um

313
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,399
you can guess i mean if this is a mesh

314
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,920
network with my neighbors right i could

315
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
say oh i'm interested in this neighbor

316
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
and this is the idea of his water meter

317
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
her water meter

318
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
now when i see no water being used for

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
maybe a day or two i know my neighbor's

320
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
no longer home

321
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
so

322
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
then what could i do maybe i like my

323
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
neighbor's stuff and i want to go get my

324
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
neighbor's stuff and i know they're not

325
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
home

326
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
so anyway some interesting attacks i

327
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
think could be uh inferred from

328
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
gathering data from things that are

329
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
attached to your house that you

330
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
basically have no control over right

331
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
um

332
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
you can't call provo and say hey i want

333
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
i want uh i don't want the neptune meter

334
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,920
anymore i want the saturn meter because

335
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
that's better encryption they're going

336
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
to laugh right we don't know what you're

337
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
talking about also get off our phone

338
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
so um

339
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
yeah and this stuff is just again

340
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
broadcast so if you can grab that data

341
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
then

342
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
there's lots of stuff like this which is

343
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
kind of fun

344
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
your car most of your cars probably if

345
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,320
they're i don't know what the year is

346
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
they started requiring these but

347
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
everybody know what a tpms sensor is

348
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
tire pressure monitoring system

349
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
every one of your tires has an rf

350
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
transmitter in it that tells your car

351
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
what your air pressure is in your tire

352
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
so if and they all have a unique id

353
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
so if you wanted to

354
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
track who was coming into or leaving a

355
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
neighborhood

356
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
i don't know maybe you'd put a box

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
somewhere inconspicuous

358
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
with the antenna and see if you could

359
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
grab

360
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
those unique ids from your neighbor's

361
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,160
cars and then track their movements

362
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
you're not touching their car is it

363
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
against the law i don't know it's

364
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
broadcasting everywhere

365
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
interesting there's interesting stuff

366
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
with rf that's kind of like gone away

367
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
from the other side of things from like

368
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
uh i mean there's still vulnerable web

369
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
apps they're still vulners and firewalls

370
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
sort of there's still you know network

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,760
volume system volumes those all still

372
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
exist but they're

373
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
uh usually these days are a little bit

374
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,639
better patched a little bit better

375
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,680
tracked

376
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
um

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
unless you've got a pretty negligent

378
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
organization they're they're they're

379
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
getting pen tests they're getting audits

380
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
but this kind of stuff just goes out

381
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
into the everywhere right so it's

382
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,959
interesting uh aircraft transponders

383
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
since 2020 uh

384
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
the faa has required every plane to have

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
an adbs

386
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,220
uh

387
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,519
[Music]

388
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,920
transmitter on your plane so that's

389
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,000
small planes big planes all planes if

390
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,040
you're in the air you have to have one

391
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
of these trans transmitters

392
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,360
and it gives you position and

393
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
elevation

394
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
and your call sign

395
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
so there's one that i picked up

396
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
we'll talk a little more about that as

397
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,639
well but

398
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,560
so those those could be interesting of

399
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,920
course you can just go on flight aware

400
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
right and just look at it anyway that

401
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,480
data apparently is public

402
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
is that a good thing i don't know i

403
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
don't think they could keep it from not

404
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
being public but

405
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
so yeah

406
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
interesting

407
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
so this is

408
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,839
uh

409
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
orem's

410
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
water

411
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
system

412
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
um

413
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
why is this interesting well one it's

414
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
interesting that

415
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
this is a critical infrastructure and it

416
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
took me about 30 seconds on google to

417
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
find a map

418
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,040
of every mainline pipe in aurum

419
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
i also ha know where their uh tanks are

420
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
you can see the tanks on there and am in

421
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,279
cyan

422
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,839
and then

423
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
a couple of treatment all those little

424
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,199
black triangles or are water

425
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,959
pressure releases

426
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,839
the tanks are interesting because

427
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
wherever they take water and introduce

428
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,639
it into the system they have to add what

429
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
do they add to the water

430
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
chlorine right because they're trying to

431
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,399
kill bacteria make the water safe for us

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
to drink

433
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,519
chlorine in concentrated amounts is good

434
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
or bad

435
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,480
it's bad

436
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,519
bad enough to where if um

437
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,160
one of these stations has a leak they

438
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
have to empty i don't know what the

439
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
radius is but neighborhoods

440
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
like you're evacuating neighborhoods if

441
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
you have a chlorine gas leak at one of

442
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
these places it doesn't happen very

443
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,320
often which i'm actually pretty

444
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
surprised about i'm hoping it's because

445
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
they have good safety measures in place

446
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
and they're audited a lot

447
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
and

448
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
they just take care of it but

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,560
let's hope right i actually haven't

450
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,079
heard of it one has anybody heard of

451
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,240
chlorine gas leak from a water treatment

452
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,040
system in a city

453
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
so pg pool had a leak

454
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,040
and and they're probably not even

455
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
dealing with the same amount of chlorine

456
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
as like water treatment right and that's

457
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,160
still a bad deal some raise your hand

458
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,319
back there

459
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
okay another pool deal

460
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,240
that's a lot

461
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
that's a lot and you're that's just a

462
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,880
pool right that's just a couple hundred

463
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
thousand gallons of water we're talking

464
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
about on these systems that's an hour

465
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,199
probably

466
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
so a lot more chlorine a lot more

467
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,480
concentrated

468
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,560
and those little outbuildings are kind

469
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
of all over the place now the reason i

470
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,639
bring all of this up is because on all

471
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
those outbuildings there is

472
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,439
an antenna

473
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
we'll talk about that in a minute so

474
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
okay so what is sdr all it is is it's

475
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
just in a way for computers to talk to

476
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,959
rf okay so

477
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,040
uses integrated circuits to control the

478
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
radio to tune it to specific frequency

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
um

480
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
and to to listen on that frequency

481
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
uh it's that's basically all it is

482
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,199
pretty straightforward

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
usually has a decent range

484
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
controlled by software gnu radio has

485
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
anybody used gnu radio before

486
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
oh my advanced users i like it so gnu

487
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
radio is awesome because you can

488
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
basically build a little radio and

489
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
software

490
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
take the signal from your adapter run it

491
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,199
through this radio filters and get the

492
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,480
exact

493
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
specific

494
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,759
signal that you want to get get a really

495
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
clean signal so new radio is really cool

496
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,280
more on the advanced side um when sdr is

497
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,319
more of a software we're going to talk

498
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
about those in a second so i'll skip

499
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
that for now

500
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
oops

501
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,280
and then yeah just needs a hardware

502
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
adapter so the radio can

503
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,959
so we can interface rf okay

504
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,799
so tools of the trade the this is the

505
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
hardware now the coolest part about sdr

506
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,240
and i think when it really started to

507
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,600
blow up was because of

508
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
um the rtl sdrs hasn't been heard of the

509
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
rtl scr

510
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
yep lots of you awesome so this thing's

511
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,799
sweet it started as a a tv

512
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,960
uh tuner basically tv tuner card if you

513
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,240
remember those from way back in the day

514
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
where you could tune in to tv signals

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
receive them on your computer

516
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,360
which back when like there were no dvds

517
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,200
or anything which is basically this was

518
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,039
or maybe about the same time you could

519
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
watch tv on your computer which was kind

520
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
of cool

521
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,679
and recorded and i think that was

522
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,919
probably the start of like

523
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,919
i don't know video sharing that kind of

524
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,280
thing but

525
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
they figured out that this chip

526
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,080
was pretty versatile and it wasn't

527
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,919
locked down to the specific tv

528
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,799
frequencies so then of course this

529
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,160
chip's already being made it's pretty

530
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
inexpensive

531
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
and you can buy these

532
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
for about 40 bucks so your total cost to

533
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,600
enter

534
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
an sdr messing around listening to stuff

535
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
is about 40 bucks maybe with an antenna

536
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,799
it's 42 or something

537
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
those are two different ones there uh

538
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
one i think has i can't remember the

539
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
difference between the two but they both

540
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,080
basically do the same thing that's the

541
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
range of receiving frequency which is

542
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
pretty wide right almost to wi-fi and

543
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
all the way down to 25 megahertz which

544
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,559
is a is a really wide range

545
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
then you can you can kind of

546
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
pre-filter your signal with different

547
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,400
adapters

548
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
these can be powered by

549
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
external power battery or usb or through

550
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
the adapter if that has the ability to

551
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,919
do that

552
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,799
and those allow you to either shift

553
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,960
where your adapter can receive

554
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
frequencies what frequencies it can

555
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
receive or it can hyper focus

556
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
on uh very specific frequencies to get

557
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
you a really clean signal or boost

558
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
boost the signal altogether to get you

559
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,280
um

560
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,799
if it's if it's a weaker signal because

561
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
when you're capturing data from the

562
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
signal you want it to be as clean as

563
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,720
possible to avoid you know garbage data

564
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
basically want to get all the ones and

565
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
all the zeros you want to get them mixed

566
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,799
up so

567
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,160
uh

568
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,919
those are probably 30 or 40 bucks a

569
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,360
piece as well you can do that in

570
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,400
software

571
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
sometimes it's harder doing software

572
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,559
so those come in handy this is called

573
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
the air spy air spy is really cool has a

574
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,679
similar range if you notice to the rtl

575
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,039
sdr

576
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,600
the air spy is a lot higher quality it's

577
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
a different chip

578
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
these are about 130 bucks i think

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,039
but produce really clean signals uh just

580
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,640
a higher quality of reception

581
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
can it do things rtl sdr can't do

582
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
debatable it is a cleaner signal for

583
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
sure so depends what your goals are the

584
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
spy verter is kind of an add-on to the

585
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,520
air spy allows you to drop down way

586
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,159
below that 24 megahertz floor on the air

587
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,080
spy down to one kilohertz which is

588
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,280
pretty slow that's 1 000 oscillations a

589
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,080
second which for for rf is very slow

590
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
um

591
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,559
yeah yeah so stick your ear next to it

592
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
um

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
the beauty of the spivard voters you get

594
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,679
down into kind of the shortwave uh

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,360
frequencies which are

596
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
kind of start at around 25 megahertz and

597
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
go down so

598
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
it allows you to kind of get into that

599
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
area and shortwave is really cool

600
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
because

601
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
it can travel really far

602
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,080
uh it can

603
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
um

604
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,039
and

605
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
you can pick up signals from basically

606
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
all over the earth depending on the

607
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
weather right

608
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
or the time of day

609
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
um affects rf as well so those are

610
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
really cool again those are all

611
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
receivers all of those things we talked

612
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
about receivers

613
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,679
and then this guy the yardstick one on

614
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
the on your right

615
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
is

616
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
probably my favorite

617
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,280
sdr tool i think they're 100 bucks

618
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,679
uh michael osmond uh created them or uh

619
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
but the chip that it uses is from an i

620
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
am me which is a toy if anybody's ever

621
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
heard of the ime raise your hand

622
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,520
yeah cause they're cool you do cool

623
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,919
stuff with them right so it's just this

624
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
little children's story that you could

625
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
like send messages to somebody that was

626
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
line of sight so it's just a little

627
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,760
radio transceiver basically but they're

628
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
but they took the chip out and like hey

629
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,840
we can do cool things with this thing i

630
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,480
think uh

631
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,720
now i'm gonna forget his name

632
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
they repurposed it to um

633
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,640
uh open garage doors who did that

634
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,360
yep sami kankar that's right so anyway

635
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,400
lots of cool stuff you can do this

636
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
little device that was a kid's toy right

637
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,200
so

638
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
he took the chip put it on this device

639
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,600
and now we can put different firmware on

640
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
it

641
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,159
and control it with my favorite language

642
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,200
python so you can

643
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,799
send signals

644
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
using python which is cool you can also

645
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
receive signals if you have the right

646
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
library you can decipher those into data

647
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
and do all kinds of

648
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
i mean cool experimental things uh

649
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,799
the the device to the left i didn't even

650
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,240
list is called the crazy radio hasn't

651
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
heard of a crazy radio before

652
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
this guy he's heard of them

653
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
you've heard of them all haven't you i

654
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,240
like it i like it okay so the crazy

655
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
radio is cool has anyone heard of the

656
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,720
hid rf attack

657
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
where you can attack keyboards this

658
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
thing

659
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
um and if anybody has one right now and

660
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
you want to i give you full license to

661
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
go for it

662
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
but basically

663
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,880
keyboards usually have some sort of uh

664
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
authentication to their dongles or their

665
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,440
adapters

666
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
this is more of a mouse with some

667
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
buttons

668
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,840
and mice

669
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
this and mice don't at all

670
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
so you can grab

671
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,320
uh signals that these make including the

672
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
equivalent of a mac address

673
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
um and then attack it using that little

674
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
adapter i think they're

675
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
10 bucks maybe 20 bucks

676
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
if you want to wait for shipping

677
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,880
um

678
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,080
better cap there's a there's a there's a

679
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
section of tools called hid and better

680
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,880
cap has anybody better cap in here

681
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
oh you should all use better cap it's

682
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,120
super freaking sweet so

683
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
it you can use better cap to do hid

684
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
attacks on these which is cool

685
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,960
um

686
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,799
that's that's step one grab one of these

687
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,159
and go screw around with bedcap it's

688
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,120
cool

689
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
and then

690
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,679
this is the grand master of all

691
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,640
rf

692
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
sdr

693
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,919
uh the the hack rf1 so

694
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
there are other ones

695
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,200
blade rf i think's another one

696
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,559
there's some higher end ones this one's

697
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,440
about the for the legit one that again

698
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
michael osmond makes this

699
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
i think they're about 300 bucks

700
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
this one has the

701
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,159
portapak which allows you to run a

702
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,360
little bit different firmware and

703
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
actually use the

704
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
hack rf1 without a computer completely

705
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,799
it's got a screen on there a little

706
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,640
input wheel and arrows and button and

707
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,520
stuff so you can do

708
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
things that without a computer

709
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
completely the one on the bottom's uh a

710
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,919
knock off

711
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,400
uh but he released all his stuff uh open

712
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
hardware so

713
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
i don't think he's super worried about

714
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,520
it um

715
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
i have both i've used both

716
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
the hack rf i think it's a little bit uh

717
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,320
cleaner signal which you'd expect but

718
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
the the knock off does about all the

719
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,559
things and you can the hack rf i think

720
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
the porta pax 100 and i want to say it's

721
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
130 bucks something like that so that

722
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
plus the uh hack rf and an enclosure

723
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
approaching 500 bucks

724
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,520
the um

725
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,799
the knockoff is about 200 so 220 maybe

726
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
um it's a little bit more affordable

727
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,840
um

728
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,320
does mostly the same stuff so if you

729
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
want to get into

730
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
transmitting which is where things kind

731
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
of really get fun

732
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
yardstick one crazy radio

733
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,039
the

734
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,480
heck rf ones are kind of where you want

735
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
to go

736
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
but again you can start for 40 bucks

737
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,559
with an rtl sdr and

738
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,400
just start messing around

739
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,640
okay so software

740
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
so

741
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,799
dragon os ubuntu based

742
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
distribution with tools installed uh

743
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
it's okay works it's got some stuff on

744
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
there

745
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,960
you could also go out and grab the tools

746
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
compile them yourself and

747
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
on a normal ubuntu

748
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,320
so this just short circuits a couple of

749
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
steps if you're

750
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
lazy like me which i enjoyed so and then

751
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
pi str is a kind of similar thing but

752
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,799
runs on a

753
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,159
raspberry pi that we all love right so

754
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,360
um

755
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,400
somewhere i think this is a little bit

756
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,159
better put together to be honest than

757
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
dragon but

758
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
the pi is great for sdr because it's

759
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
cheap

760
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,400
you've got linux and it doesn't matter

761
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
what your other machine is right you can

762
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
have you can have a linux machine

763
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
talking to it you can have a windows

764
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,640
machine talking to her you can have a

765
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
mac which

766
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,520
i'm stuck with so

767
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
that's nice because we get access to a

768
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,279
linux machine that

769
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,600
a lot of tools are built on

770
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
and then

771
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
for kind of general discovery i just

772
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
covered a

773
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,919
an example for each os so

774
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,240
as much as i hate to admit it the sdr

775
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
sharp on windows which is actually made

776
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880
by the people that make the airspy

777
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
receiver

778
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
is probably the best one

779
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,440
now

780
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,159
hacking tools on windows makes me sad

781
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,000
inside a little bit

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,159
apologies for any windows fans

783
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,200
but

784
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
it's the best one it's it's got lots of

785
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,799
stuff that

786
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,400
makes a little bit easier identify where

787
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
you are in the spectrum

788
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,159
identify signals

789
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
the waterfall is pretty descriptive as

790
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,679
well you can see kind of those stripes

791
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
in the middle that's the waterfall

792
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,679
shows you kind of how the signals are

793
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,360
progressing over time and then at the

794
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,440
top you can kind of see where

795
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
each one of those peaks is a signal

796
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,000
and it's doing something right we don't

797
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
know what but there's something being

798
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,039
broadcast there

799
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,919
so

800
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,279
sdr sharp is pretty good on windows

801
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,600
and then if you're on

802
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,640
mac

803
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
cubic str is a little bit more bare

804
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,159
bones but does get the job done

805
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,039
i did a lot of discovery with that

806
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
preparation for this

807
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
and

808
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,039
it's good not quite as many features

809
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,240
but

810
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,200
it's

811
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
in the app store it's easy to install

812
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
right so

813
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,679
no hoops to jump through and then on

814
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,600
linux there's sdr plus plus which is

815
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,679
open source which is cool a little bit

816
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
more featured than um cubic uh not quite

817
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,480
as developed as sdr sharp but basically

818
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
for any platform you have a gui tool

819
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,399
that you can pop in there

820
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,520
plug in your your 40 rtl scr and start

821
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
exploring the rf spectrum which i think

822
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
is pretty rad

823
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
before the rtl sdr it was hundreds of

824
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
dollars to get some sort of device to

825
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,000
get your computer to talk to rf right

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,080
it predates the hack rf

827
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,679
so that didn't exist at the time there

828
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,679
was kind of it's kind of a specialty

829
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,279
area

830
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,480
that kind of opened it up to

831
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
all of us nice people that don't want to

832
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,520
spend a couple thousand bucks on

833
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,159
an sdr adapter

834
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,880
um and then as far as software goes

835
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,960
this is where things start to get

836
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
interesting so you can do a bunch of

837
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,840
exploration using these tools

838
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,440
using the hardware

839
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,799
but

840
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,640
there's lots of libraries and lots of

841
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
tools that are very specific to a very

842
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
specific thing i mentioned the

843
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,520
the power meter on my house earlier

844
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
uh there's a specific library that

845
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,320
you can

846
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,200
grab off github and start grabbing data

847
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
from that from your water meter

848
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,200
um

849
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,559
so

850
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
i didn't write any of those but i'm sure

851
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,399
is heck fire gonna use them all because

852
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,480
they're right there and i can do cool

853
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,640
stuff with them so

854
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
uh

855
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,880
that's that's where things start to kind

856
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
of get interesting although i don't want

857
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,559
to downplay just the general exploration

858
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,720
because i sat probably in my living room

859
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,600
with

860
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,480
cubic and rtl sdr for i don't know three

861
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
or four hours just exploring the range

862
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,559
that it could receive on

863
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,480
all kinds of interesting stuff stuff i

864
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
couldn't decipher

865
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
you can cover f1 fm in there i don't

866
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
know why but like i don't listen to

867
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,080
radio ever because it's the radio

868
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,880
but

869
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,960
um

870
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
i'm just this young enough to not be a

871
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,919
boomer but um the

872
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,919
but for some reason getting an fm radio

873
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,760
broadcast on my computer was super cool

874
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,880
i don't know why

875
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,360
but it is

876
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
so anyway okay so we've covered hardware

877
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,559
we've covered software

878
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
now let's look at probably the most

879
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
important part of well they're all

880
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
important but one of the more important

881
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,919
parts of

882
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,919
this is the antenna

883
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,440
so

884
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
these are different could cover the

885
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,440
different types then we're going to

886
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
cover when you want to use specific

887
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,399
antennas okay so monopole

888
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,880
it's just just an antenna just goes like

889
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
this you can see that giant tower the

890
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
antenna is that little tiny white thing

891
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,080
at the very top

892
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,919
the towers just to give it elevation to

893
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,679
get it out of uh any kind of

894
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,039
obstructions that are around it so i can

895
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,840
get line of sight to lots of places

896
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,679
um

897
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,320
it's just basically a wire

898
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,840
usually vertical

899
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,039
[Music]

900
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,519
and it emits it

901
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
whatever is transmitting on it emits the

902
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,320
rf through that wire

903
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
we'll talk about wavelengths and how big

904
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,159
antenna should be in just a moment but

905
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,360
the shape of a monopole or

906
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,159
omnidirectional antenna is like a donut

907
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,679
so it's a big donut starts the middle

908
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,880
that's where the signal comes out and

909
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
from there it just waves out

910
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
in kind of a circle right it's hard to

911
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,679
display

912
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,720
described in 2d space but it's a donut

913
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
so that's how it goes it goes out every

914
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
direction

915
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,720
in equal strengths okay covers a lot of

916
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
area

917
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,158
um

918
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,399
a lot of area in a circle

919
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,080
not the greatest for

920
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
long range communication unless you got

921
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
a giant mask like this

922
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,519
okay dipole

923
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,880
this is a yagi has anybody heard of a

924
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,080
yagi yagi's are cool right so

925
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,120
directional antenna

926
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
great for longer distances but it

927
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
broadcasts in a cone okay

928
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,200
so you've got if you want to talk to

929
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
another antenna that's 10 miles away

930
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,000
your omnidirectional may not

931
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
make that happen unless you give it a

932
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,960
bunch of power and then the fcc gets

933
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
grumpy at you so

934
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
on a on a yogi though you can beam it

935
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
straight you can point them right at

936
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
each other

937
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,000
and for relatively low power talk for a

938
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,840
pretty long distance the other thing

939
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,159
yagi gives you is some privacy right now

940
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,840
that you've got a cone

941
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
or

942
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,880
it's a little more cylindrical but it

943
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,360
does it bleeds off for sure so

944
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
but if you're behind it or to the side

945
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
of it you're probably it's probably

946
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,600
harder to pick up that signal

947
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
especially at any kind of distance if

948
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
you're close you can probably still get

949
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,679
it but

950
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,000
anyway

951
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,080
aperture so this is just a dish antenna

952
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,000
the signal concentrates in the dish and

953
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
then puts it out to the element which is

954
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,360
out on the

955
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
middle there and

956
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,360
great for long distances directed

957
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,240
transmissions

958
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
a loop antenna it's kind of kind of

959
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,440
funky

960
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
um

961
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,880
i don't know that much about a loop

962
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,559
antenna i'll be honest with you i did

963
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,080
use one when i played with shortwave a

964
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,039
little bit

965
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,840
um but

966
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,519
i think it's better for lower

967
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,120
lower

968
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,519
frequencies so array lots of antennas

969
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,960
working together okay the dugo is one of

970
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,000
these

971
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,880
every one of those vertical kind of sets

972
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
of towers has i don't know

973
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,240
10 or 15 elements that are broadcasting

974
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,399
so those are all working together

975
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,760
and then

976
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,159
you also want the antenna sized to match

977
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,679
your wavelength your wavelength is

978
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,840
determined by your frequency

979
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,279
[Music]

980
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,080
so

981
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
that's

982
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
a little bit on more on that in a moment

983
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,360
so the antenna is very important part of

984
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,200
the system it's probably the dumbest

985
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
part of the system it doesn't really do

986
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
anything other than

987
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,840
uh

988
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
broadcast the signal right power goes to

989
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
it it goes out it's there's no moving

990
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,919
pieces

991
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,918
there's there's nothing really happening

992
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,918
there but if it's size wrong or if it's

993
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,599
the wrong antenna you're gonna have a

994
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,879
hard time getting the signal or

995
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,719
achieving your goal of doing whatever it

996
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,079
is you want to do

997
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,119
okay

998
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
so

999
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,199
different types of rf attacks

1000
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,359
so eavesdropping is the most obvious

1001
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,599
right it costs you 40 bucks to get into

1002
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,599
you can grab signals from whatever's

1003
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,719
being broadcast within your range okay

1004
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,560
pretty easy that may be sensitive data

1005
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,719
it may not be sensitive data maybe how

1006
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,560
much pressure's in your car tire that

1007
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,599
also tells me that you're leaving the

1008
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,599
neighborhood it may be how much water

1009
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,159
you're using tells me your home

1010
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,839
it may tell me how much power you're

1011
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,960
using

1012
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,000
i don't know um

1013
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,599
man of the middle attacks

1014
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,280
these are a little bit harder to achieve

1015
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,079
than

1016
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,679
if you had like a wi-fi man in the

1017
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,320
middle historically you'd think of like

1018
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,480
you're attached to you're connected to a

1019
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
rogue access point that access point has

1020
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
a bad actor then they're forwarding on

1021
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
data and you're interrupting that

1022
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,720
communication this would be more of a

1023
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,880
you're grabbing broadcast data

1024
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,760
rebroadcasting it and saying hey i'm not

1025
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
i'm the legitimate one not the other one

1026
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
you were talking to

1027
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
so a little bit different on rf and then

1028
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,960
replay which is probably one of the

1029
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
lowest

1030
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
brow attacks ever

1031
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,200
because all you have to do

1032
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
is um

1033
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,839
record a signal

1034
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,320
and then play it back

1035
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
so it's not you're not doing anything to

1036
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,599
it you don't have to decipher it you

1037
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,040
don't have to grab the data out of it

1038
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,599
excuse me um

1039
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,760
so in 2016

1040
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,680
uh well there's this room or that room

1041
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
but

1042
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,400
i also i i presented on

1043
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,800
some home automation home security

1044
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,440
systems and one of them

1045
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,839
was uh

1046
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,920
was vulnerable to replay attacks

1047
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
from the keypad to

1048
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the kind of main system

1049
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
so uh yeah if you're bored or can't

1050
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
sleep look up

1051
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
thicker my last name sync on 2020 or

1052
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
2016.

1053
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,359
and all you had to do was capture the

1054
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,040
signal from the keypad of somebody

1055
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,960
unlocking their house basically turning

1056
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
it off when they get home

1057
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,079
and then record that play it back

1058
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,480
uh whenever you want and it would just

1059
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
do this it would disable the the system

1060
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
so

1061
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,680
that was super low brow you're basically

1062
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,280
it's basically the um phone freaking

1063
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
like pay phones anybody familiar like

1064
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,240
you you play play the tone and you get

1065
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,400
credit right so

1066
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
i mean it's worse than that right

1067
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,359
because instead of free phone calls now

1068
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
you're disabling someone's home security

1069
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
system

1070
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,119
so replay while it is probably like the

1071
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,119
easiest thing to do in the world and all

1072
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,400
of the rtl sdr sorry

1073
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,359
oh

1074
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,920
so all the rtl sdr can receive that data

1075
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
and record that data you'd need a

1076
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,920
transceiver or a hack rf1 or a

1077
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
yardstick to replay that data

1078
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
but

1079
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
it's it's pretty cool most home

1080
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
automation systems are vulnerable to

1081
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
this um

1082
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,920
on most devices

1083
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200
doing that same

1084
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
research i did for that

1085
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,000
it was actually part of my master's

1086
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,560
thesis but

1087
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,560
most of the systems were vulnerable to

1088
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,800
that on most components deadbolts

1089
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,599
thankfully did have encryption on z-wave

1090
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,560
so

1091
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,240
those could not be replayed but i could

1092
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,920
turn lights on and off

1093
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
um i could

1094
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
you know pretend somebody's window

1095
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,920
opened or closed

1096
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,119
not

1097
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,000
available um and then ford's message so

1098
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,560
ford's message is i know how the system

1099
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,720
works or i have a library that knows how

1100
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,000
the system works

1101
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
i'm just going to create my own message

1102
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
just do whatever i want

1103
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
so that would be true for um

1104
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
if i was able to break the encryption on

1105
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,079
a deadbolt then i could um

1106
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,599
i could forge a message right because i

1107
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,880
knew the encryption or if i was able to

1108
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
get the key

1109
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,240
then that encryption key then i could

1110
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,960
forge a message to say unlock

1111
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,599
what have you so

1112
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,119
forged message is probably the most

1113
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,800
interesting although replay is probably

1114
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
the most fun because it takes like no

1115
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
work and if the system's vulnerable to

1116
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
it it

1117
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,599
just recorded lots of different things

1118
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,960
of what you want to do turn on the light

1119
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,000
in the living room turn off the light in

1120
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,960
the living room turn on the light in the

1121
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,720
bedroom turn on the fan of the bedroom

1122
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,440
so

1123
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,880
there's um

1124
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,079
anyway all this stuff's super

1125
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,000
interesting to me i hope i hope you guys

1126
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,480
are uh interested in as well uh any

1127
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,359
formula one fans yes

1128
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,920
favorite team

1129
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,000
nice all you need to know is mercedes is

1130
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,480
evil

1131
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,560
and i only like red bull because they

1132
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
have the ability to beat mercedes so

1133
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
um

1134
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
anyway again car nerd so

1135
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,520
here's how you

1136
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,480
start to access sdr now that we've

1137
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
covered kind of all the bases of what

1138
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
goes into it

1139
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,119
your frequency is going to determine the

1140
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,960
wavelength okay so frequency if you

1141
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,100
recall is in hertz right

1142
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,480
[Music]

1143
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,280
i'm going to go through a couple

1144
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
examples so you don't have to memorize

1145
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,839
this on the first slide

1146
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,400
but the wavelength will dictate your

1147
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,760
antenna what you're using for your

1148
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
antennas kind of sizing

1149
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
and

1150
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,320
obviously what you tune to using the

1151
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
radio okay so if you know your target's

1152
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,760
on 900 megahertz or 905 megahertz and

1153
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,480
that's what you're going to tune your

1154
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,520
radio to

1155
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,359
your antenna that matches that

1156
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,040
wavelength okay and you can look that up

1157
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,119
that's super easy you can just say 900

1158
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,640
megahertz wavelength and google and

1159
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,000
it'll tell you what the length is i'll

1160
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,880
show you what to do with that in a

1161
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,760
minute

1162
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,960
okay

1163
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,160
oh so this okay let me see this may be

1164
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,400
total technology fail so you may say

1165
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
well i don't know what the frequency is

1166
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,359
because i'm looking at a device it

1167
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,240
doesn't tell me what it is

1168
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,119
so the fcc is really cool because when

1169
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,119
you make a device that emits rf you have

1170
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,359
to submit it to them for approval

1171
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,400
and they make all that data public so

1172
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,040
this fccio is just like a url shortener

1173
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,480
that's actually super cool because all

1174
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,839
you have to do if you remember that

1175
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,440
power meter i showed you a photo of on

1176
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,800
my house

1177
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
all i did here was and all you have to

1178
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,599
do for this url is fccio and then the

1179
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,000
fcc id which is printed on the face of

1180
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,359
that power meter

1181
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,720
so i don't know what frequency that

1182
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,920
operates on it doesn't say on the

1183
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
sticker

1184
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,280
let me see if i'm going to be able to so

1185
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,520
i'm going to click this

1186
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,800
maybe

1187
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,440
i might have to go

1188
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
all right

1189
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,720
i'll just copy it how about that

1190
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,200
it's gonna show you oh yeah sweet okay

1191
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,118
so let me open this up a little bit

1192
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,200
i'm just going to paste that url right

1193
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
in there so all that is is fccio

1194
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
the scc id which is printed on the face

1195
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,599
of that meter and then it's going to

1196
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,319
take us right to the fcc website

1197
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,480
and here is the entry for that it's

1198
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,280
going to be a little hard to read let me

1199
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,440
see if i can

1200
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
make that a little bit bigger so we'll

1201
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
go to i mean we don't want the summer we

1202
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,720
want the detail right so let's yeah okay

1203
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,400
um and then in here we've got

1204
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,520
yeah external photos that's interesting

1205
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,319
so

1206
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,160
looks like 2013 so i'm sure that

1207
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
firmware is like totally up to date

1208
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
because you know that was only a few

1209
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,880
years ago

1210
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,839
so we can look at um let's look at

1211
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,119
external photos let's see if this is

1212
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,760
really the device i have on my house

1213
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,599
there's the board looks generally like

1214
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,530
the right shape okay

1215
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,040
[Music]

1216
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
and then let's see that open a new

1217
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,440
window yeah so

1218
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,720
internal that looks like an internal

1219
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,480
photo actually let's see if it's an

1220
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,000
internal so basically

1221
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
i mean that's the unit right there right

1222
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,440
so

1223
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,560
that could be interesting if you're

1224
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,079
really trying to attack it at kind of

1225
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,240
the physical layer

1226
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,480
all of the stuff's public information

1227
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,839
the other thing that's interesting that

1228
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,920
i skipped past on the first page is

1229
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,960
yup

1230
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,200
yup

1231
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,880
this right here so we know now

1232
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,000
that it operates between 902 and 927

1233
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,560
megahertz so in that range all i need to

1234
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
do now

1235
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,440
is make sure i have an antenna the right

1236
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
size

1237
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,560
tune my rtl sdr to

1238
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
i don't know let's start at 902 zero

1239
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,920
go stand next to my power meter and

1240
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
just go across that spectrum that 20

1241
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,640
megahertz 25 megahertz

1242
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,400
and see when i have a big spike in

1243
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,040
broadcast that's my frequency now i know

1244
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,200
where my power meter is broadcasting on

1245
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
so

1246
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,560
that's super easy

1247
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,280
like super easy it's public data scco

1248
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
makes it even easier

1249
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,319
and

1250
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,480
your fcc id has to be printed on all of

1251
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,319
your devices that emit rf

1252
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,839
so there's your key to figuring out what

1253
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,359
the frequency is

1254
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,200
all right

1255
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
back to

1256
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,680
business

1257
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,079
all right so

1258
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,160
the direction or the distance you want

1259
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
to go is going to determine your antenna

1260
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,000
okay so if you know that you want to

1261
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,240
capture a wide range

1262
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,480
then you want a monopole right you want

1263
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,400
an omnidirectional antenna if you want

1264
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,599
to go

1265
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,160
a long a far distance but you don't care

1266
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,839
as much about what's on the sidelines

1267
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:56,880
you want you're targeting something

1268
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,839
specific

1269
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,680
then you want a yogi or something

1270
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,960
directional

1271
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,079
i'm going to need to blast these a

1272
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:02,960
little bit

1273
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,640
okay so your goals are going to dictate

1274
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,160
what your sdr adapter is if you're just

1275
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,319
trying to listen and receive rtl sdr is

1276
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,720
fine air spy is fine

1277
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,640
if you want to broadcast

1278
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,079
really mess with stuff then you need a

1279
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,119
transceiver hack rf1 yardstick one and

1280
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,560
then whatever your

1281
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,040
attack or

1282
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,119
research

1283
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,079
is going to determine what software

1284
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,920
using if you're just doing discovery one

1285
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,680
of those general tuner softwares will

1286
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,720
work

1287
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,839
if you're going farther and doing

1288
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,960
something else you may have to write

1289
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,040
your own library you may have you may

1290
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
lots of stuff that's common has

1291
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,079
libraries written for it already search

1292
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:36,960
around

1293
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,599
okay so here's a specific example

1294
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,359
adsb

1295
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,079
is the airplane transponders okay

1296
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,560
and this is just i just uh

1297
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,319
pulled out the right tools hooked it all

1298
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,440
up and went for it okay so frequency is

1299
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,760
1090 megahertz okay

1300
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,640
or

1301
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
uh whatever that is in gigahertz less

1302
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,599
than that

1303
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,480
uh 1.09 gigahertz so

1304
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,319
the wavelength for that as i found from

1305
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,599
googling it is 275 millimeters that's

1306
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,280
pretty long for an antenna so i'm gonna

1307
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
divide it by four you can use antennas

1308
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,720
in

1309
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
uh different waves they call them okay

1310
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,079
so you're gonna so this is gonna be a

1311
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,520
quarter wave antenna because it's

1312
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,760
divided by four 69 millimeters pretty

1313
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,440
easy pretty short antenna i had one

1314
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,839
laying around um

1315
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,760
you can buy like a box of antennas for

1316
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
like 20 bucks on amazon so they're not

1317
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,920
expensive different lengths you can also

1318
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
use a telescoping antenna one comes with

1319
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,680
a hack rf1

1320
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,280
measure it get it to the right length

1321
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,680
you need and there's your wave okay so i

1322
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,280
use 69 millimeter it's a quarter wave

1323
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,599
antenna for the 1090 megahertz

1324
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,480
um and then i knew that planes were all

1325
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,599
around me right i don't know where they

1326
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,200
are i'm not going to point at them i

1327
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,800
just want to gather data from wherever

1328
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,480
they are right so omni direction was the

1329
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,760
right move

1330
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,520
monopole antenna

1331
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,280
which sounds really cool but it's just

1332
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,920
one of these right it's just straight up

1333
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,760
and then

1334
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
i just want to listen and capture so rtl

1335
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,680
sdr is perfect for that

1336
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,680
and my

1337
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,200
i should not put attack i should have

1338
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,599
researched right re research

1339
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
um i wanted to map where planes were

1340
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,480
because i think that's cool

1341
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,599
and they're telling me where they are so

1342
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,280
why not throw them on a map

1343
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,720
okay so this is um the raw output of

1344
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,680
that

1345
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,040
latitude longitude call signs

1346
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,960
how many packets they've sent me

1347
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,720
and then this is the map

1348
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,560
and software dump is called dump 1090.

1349
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,880
it this is all kind of part of it right

1350
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,960
so you just compile this run it and it

1351
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,560
puts on a map on a web server for you

1352
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,680
can pull it from anything on the same

1353
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,440
network it's kind of hard to see the

1354
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,800
planes there but there's a plane at the

1355
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,720
bottom there's one in the middle and

1356
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
there's one all the way up in salt lake

1357
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,079
that i was able to get from my backyard

1358
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,720
in provo uh kind of cool

1359
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,720
and that's my super

1360
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,800
high tech setup

1361
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,560
i used a coffee k n is kind of the back

1362
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
plane for that thing uh

1363
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,240
or food can maybe and rt 40 rt lsdr

1364
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,760
garbage antenna

1365
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,160
okay uh the other thing you do uh

1366
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,319
flightaware does make a pie

1367
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,400
aware version which is flightaware that

1368
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,760
runs on a raspberry pi our favorite

1369
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,040
linux computer

1370
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,440
so a little prettier right it's a little

1371
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,280
bit more of a closed system but super

1372
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,839
easy to spin up throw it on an sd card

1373
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,960
throw srt sdr into the usb antenna

1374
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,640
you're off and

1375
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,880
gathering data it will share this to

1376
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,960
flightaware if you tell it to

1377
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
which is kind of cool

1378
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
um

1379
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,559
kind of like dump 1090 better because it

1380
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,920
was just kind of like running locally

1381
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,440
and i didn't have to worry about this

1382
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,760
commercial stuff but whatever

1383
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,280
or you can use

1384
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
hack rf1 with the backpack and the

1385
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,559
custom firmware that's called mayhem

1386
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,000
which actually has a lot more

1387
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,200
functionality than just this but

1388
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,400
you can

1389
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
go to adsb

1390
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
function on the

1391
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
what is that in the middle there you can

1392
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,400
see the plains it seems a little dark

1393
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,319
and then you click on one it's touch

1394
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,720
screen click on one click c on map your

1395
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,599
sd card you load a sd card up with maps

1396
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,280
and then there it is right there in

1397
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,559
provo

1398
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,319
so that you don't need a computer you

1399
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,160
just it's a little box that can be

1400
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,040
battery battery powered

1401
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,359
okay so this is

1402
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,160
another receiving exercise

1403
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,520
pretty sweet

1404
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,960
because we're now going to talk to a

1405
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
satellite we're going to let it talk to

1406
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,720
us i guess i should say

1407
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,640
frequency is 1700 megahertz which is

1408
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,119
pretty close to what very

1409
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,200
widely used rf system

1410
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,559
yes what else

1411
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,559
more commonly used

1412
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,520
it's close enough to wi-fi okay so wi-fi

1413
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,880
is 2.4 1.7 it's pretty close close

1414
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,559
enough that we can use a

1415
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,559
wi-fi directional antenna and i'll show

1416
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,640
you that in a second

1417
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,200
we do want a dish antenna directional

1418
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,720
because we are talking to something that

1419
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,040
is 22 000 miles away

1420
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,960
which i think is pretty cool

1421
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,119
um we're just going to listen capture

1422
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,960
i'm going to use rtl sdr with a special

1423
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,520
filter that basically just enhances that

1424
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,040
specific signal

1425
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,200
called the sawbird i think it was 30

1426
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,359
bucks or something

1427
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,520
and then we're going to capture data and

1428
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,880
this is what that data looks like so

1429
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,640
there's my awesome setup another

1430
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,160
raspberry pi

1431
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
the filter you can see installed above

1432
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,680
between the antenna

1433
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,160
wire and the

1434
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,119
rtl sdr there uh and then you have to

1435
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,640
kind of aim it because the thing's

1436
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,160
pretty far away there's two of them you

1437
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,079
can tune two closest one is um kind of

1438
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,599
on the way to hawaii

1439
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,640
and then

1440
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,720
there's my super cool wi-fi dish and

1441
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,400
then running by itself battery powered

1442
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,839
with the pie i just left it out there

1443
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,319
for half a day or so

1444
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,319
and then you can download

1445
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,200
like

1446
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,040
super cool images of the earth from a

1447
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,680
satellite like this is not you could go

1448
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,040
on google and just google ghost

1449
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,280
satellite images this is an image when i

1450
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,760
download i was about 10 minutes old of

1451
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,680
the weather systems on the planet

1452
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,520
currently

1453
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,240
i think it's pretty sweet

1454
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,960
and you don't need the interwebs

1455
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,880
and then you can also look at there's

1456
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
different views that it'll provide you

1457
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,839
those are obviously precipitation storms

1458
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,440
this is the other satellite the first

1459
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,520
satellite the u.s is kind of up into the

1460
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,960
side this it's kind of down to the

1461
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
bottom this one's off

1462
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,359
um looking down anyway

1463
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,960
i think it's pretty sweet

1464
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,680
so that's just messing around with about

1465
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,680
70 worth of hardware the dish was about

1466
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,960
100 bucks

1467
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,880
uh it's about 170 bucks you talk to a

1468
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,960
satellite

1469
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,880
so other attacks we talked a little bit

1470
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,880
about water treatment plant so

1471
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,160
i've audited water treatment plants so

1472
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,760
i'm a little i'm i'm

1473
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,359
cheating a little bit because i know how

1474
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,839
it works but i'm not sharing anything

1475
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,359
that isn't public information that you

1476
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,880
could find on google

1477
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,440
like in five minutes so

1478
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,520
almost everything on a water treatment

1479
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,240
system uses rs-485 which is the type of

1480
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,839
serial communication

1481
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,319
modbus very widely used is anybody used

1482
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,559
or dealt with modbus before

1483
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,319
nice nice couple of you

1484
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,000
great so widely used very open

1485
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,480
standard right it's basically ethernet

1486
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,960
then i did a little googling and found

1487
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,760
out that the most widely used system

1488
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,559
wireless communication systems in water

1489
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,200
that are marketed to water treatment

1490
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,000
systems for cities runs in in these

1491
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,160
frequencies again that was a 30-second

1492
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,359
google

1493
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,960
and those are in bands called ism bands

1494
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
industrial scientific and medical i

1495
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,640
believe is what that stands for and

1496
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,640
they're what's called unlicensed so you

1497
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,319
have if you remember the beginning that

1498
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,760
big

1499
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,079
pile of image they show you is fcc band

1500
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,920
plan all of those have different things

1501
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
and different things you can do in them

1502
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,119
some of them you have to have a license

1503
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,200
like a ham license to broadcast in which

1504
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,640
is an amateur license some of them you

1505
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,760
have to have a professional license

1506
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,599
which means you said hey fcc we're gonna

1507
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,119
do the specific thing we want to buy

1508
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,640
these frequencies and we're gonna do

1509
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,960
this thing in this area uh only let us

1510
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,400
do that and they'll they'll they'll

1511
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,280
after you pay them a bunch of money

1512
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599
they'll let you do that and then um but

1513
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,520
ism bands are open okay so

1514
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,280
that's where these are both of these are

1515
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,160
in isem bands old wireless

1516
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,880
phones house phones run 900 megahertz

1517
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,280
4033 some of your tpms sensors run at

1518
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,119
433 some of them run different

1519
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,440
frequencies but they're all in open

1520
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,880
unlicensed bands because then you don't

1521
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,200
have to get approved from the fcc you

1522
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,119
have to limit your broadcast strength to

1523
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,880
whatever it is so

1524
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,760
i know they're running on these

1525
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,520
frequencies or thereabouts i know

1526
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,480
they're using modbus which i can easily

1527
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,839
get

1528
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,400
libraries to decode that

1529
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,920
but then you're like well then you still

1530
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,119
have to get the signal right so this is

1531
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,480
that little road there i mentioned that

1532
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,280
i like to ride a bike a lot so

1533
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,040
that little road there is called murdoch

1534
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,680
canals we've been on murdoch now before

1535
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,000
yes just this awesome path that runs

1536
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,079
through orem and all the way to wherever

1537
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,720
north far

1538
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,200
anyway so on saturday i was on a bike

1539
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,319
ride and i'm like man i need a photo of

1540
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,200
one of these things so i can show

1541
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,040
the audience right so this is just a

1542
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,960
google maps image of

1543
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,720
this thing so i didn't actually remember

1544
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,480
this was there but i'm on my on my bike

1545
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,599
ride i'm looking around i'm like oh

1546
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,480
there we go

1547
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,319
so that's me from the path taking a

1548
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,839
photo of

1549
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,240
in that building is a high concentration

1550
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,000
of chlorine gas in some sort of

1551
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,240
containers right safety they're all very

1552
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,280
safe

1553
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,640
no one in this room has even heard of a

1554
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,800
leak other than it pools so that's good

1555
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,960
right it's all very safe and

1556
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,400
it's kind of hard to see but in that

1557
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,240
break in the trees and the top there is

1558
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,960
a little mast and on that mast

1559
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
is a yogi antenna

1560
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,960
so

1561
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,640
not saying you could like

1562
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,200
capture data there but

1563
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,520
you might be able to capture data there

1564
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
we basically know what the frequencies

1565
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,000
those things are going to be

1566
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,680
broadcasting on and you can kind of look

1567
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,280
at the yagi once you get an eye for it a

1568
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,119
little bit you can say that's probably

1569
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,240
on this frequency or thereabouts

1570
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,599
you'd have to get yourself in a position

1571
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:16,960
that's a directional antenna right so

1572
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,480
you'd want to get on the other side of

1573
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,160
it somewhere where it's probably where

1574
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,000
it's aiming

1575
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,240
these are all over like there's one

1576
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,839
right up rock canyon you go on a hike

1577
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,240
for about 30 seconds there's a chlorine

1578
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,200
building up there with one of those

1579
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,640
yagi's that's about

1580
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,480
maybe 10 feet off the ground you

1581
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,559
wouldn't have to walk too far away point

1582
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,400
another yagi at that thing and figure

1583
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,640
out what it's talking about right

1584
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,920
i'm not going to say whether they

1585
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,319
control things using that wireless

1586
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,680
communication but they may control

1587
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,440
things using that communication they may

1588
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,119
only report data using that

1589
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,520
communication

1590
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
but that would be super interesting to

1591
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,119
control and in the wrong hands it could

1592
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,359
be a problem right like

1593
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,040
uh it seems like we're most worried

1594
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,319
about our critical infrastructure at the

1595
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,440
moment and water is about as critical as

1596
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,839
it gets right water power

1597
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,000
gas

1598
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,040
so

1599
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,400
it's a little bit

1600
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,119
more overt than like

1601
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,960
how do you look at transmissions from

1602
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,200
the power grid they probably use i

1603
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
assume they use physical cabling to for

1604
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,559
all those systems but these remote

1605
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,760
locations

1606
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,040
they have to use rf so

1607
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,559
it's worth exploring this kind of

1608
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,319
stuff's everywhere in rf this is one

1609
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,760
example but it's used so widely and

1610
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,640
probably protected so thinly

1611
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,200
that it's just encoding right most of

1612
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,040
stuff is just encoded

1613
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,119
and encoding is not encryption we all

1614
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,079
know that so

1615
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,760
anyway i would say go explore grab spend

1616
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,000
40 bucks grab a dongle grab some

1617
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
antennas

1618
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,599
go just check stuff out it's basically

1619
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,480
free

1620
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
every any computer you have is going to

1621
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,040
have some software you can run on it

1622
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,599
find stuff that might be interesting

1623
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,440
find something that has an antenna or an

1624
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,200
fcc id hey this is going to be

1625
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
broadcasting rf

1626
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,000
um can i listen to it can i then replay

1627
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
those messages can i decode those

1628
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,160
messages can i then forge

1629
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,160
messages to make that thing do what i

1630
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,359
want it to do

1631
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,119
um a great next step is um

1632
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,960
michael osmond who makes he's he's kind

1633
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,160
of a guy in the str area but

1634
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,520
he has a pretty good how-to on how to

1635
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,599
use gnu radio gnu radio allows you to

1636
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,599
take messages

1637
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,920
isolate that signal

1638
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,160
and then you can take that

1639
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,599
decode it or have libraries already

1640
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,720
decode it

1641
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,640
for forge messages do all kinds of

1642
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,319
things like that

1643
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
but dig in check it out look around

1644
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,960
there's antennas everywhere and i think

1645
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,319
they're all pretty interesting thanks

1646
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,880
for coming today i appreciate it

1647
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,280
[Applause]
