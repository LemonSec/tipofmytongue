1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
yeah ransomware

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,040
this is me uh james pope

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,560
if you're at the keynote it's the same

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,559
thing um but those who weren't because i

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,400
know a lot of people came late

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,160
i work at the corelight

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
director of customer training also saint

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,800
kong committee member sit in the black

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
hat knock dc 435 dc 801 b-sides

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
everybody just calls me pope so that's

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
fine do that

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
twitter's there

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
all right so today we're talking about

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,679
ransomware as you can see from this

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
there's lots of types of ransomware

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,160
we'll get into more detail that as we go

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
this is going to be a

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
i'll just go let's just do it all right

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,600
so what is ransomware it starts with

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
there's baddies right there's bad guys

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
and bad guys want access to

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
money

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,120
right

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,719
this is their objective let's get some

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
monies

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
specifically they want your money

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,440
because that's the only way it matters

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
to you right we can talk about

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
theoretics and other orgs but they want

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,760
your money

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
you have an organization

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
whether that's a big org a non-profit a

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
financial a small org whatever that

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
might be in your organization they do

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,880
some recon against it

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
they start by trying to understand what

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
is your organization what does it have

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
what's ways they can get into that

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
organization to gain some initial access

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
this typically comes through

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,799
fishing patching

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,759
um that's probably your top two rdp

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
brute for password passwords that are

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,560
known on the internet that they're

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,119
reusing spraying et cetera et cetera

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,880
getting some initial access

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
after that they do some execution

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
that is where they're deploying some

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
sort of payload onto your system

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,240
to

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
hook into it so you fish the box what do

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
you do after that box you then

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
gain access to the system privilege go

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,399
after some something on a windows system

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
linux system et cetera getting some sort

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,600
of a foothold

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
then they move on to persistence

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
right persistence is

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
they now have that foothold how do they

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
make sure they maintain that the

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
old-school way scheduled tasks news new

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
ways you can you know can jump right to

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
beacons or levels in between there

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
but gain some persistence in that

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
network

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
then they escalate right if i land it on

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
a box that has no admin on it

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
i want to get admin the attackers want

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
to move to admin so they want to

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,879
escalate those privileges to that or

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,959
move to another box another privileged

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,160
i.t

73
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
domain security forest etc something

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
that gives them more access to do more

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
things

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
then they want to avoid you defenders

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
defenders are trying to find them their

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,879
objective is to not be found until they

79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,239
are ready

80
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,599
there is a lot of argument out there

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,640
saying that

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,959
sometimes they move so fast that they

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
don't care about this phase

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
that

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
blue teamers aren't looking so they can

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
just do it without evasion so depends on

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
the org sometimes they have to evade

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
sometimes there's no need to do any

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
evasion because nobody's looking for

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
them

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
also more recon the proper names of this

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
be credential access and discovery but

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
we'll just simplify it with more recon

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
looking further now now i have access to

95
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
this what else can i do

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
what other boxes can i touch what other

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
sub nets can i access what other vlans

98
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
can i go after

99
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
and then

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
summarize lateral movement into just

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
more access right i have access to this

102
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
box i want to move to additional boxes

103
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
maybe it's in a different forest maybe

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
it's behind a different firewall zone i

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
want to move from one section to the

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
next go to more access lateral movement

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
and then we jump to impact impacts a

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
fancy term that just is like you show up

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
to work and there's skulls and

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
crossbones on your computer

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
that's your impact

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
you've been ransomwared give us the

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
money right that's your impact it's been

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
burned down

115
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
and the bad guys profit

116
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,799
there we go that was their objective

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
golden ticket

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,599
but

119
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,879
we have leveled up our games as

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,959
defenders so

121
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
we're now like no

122
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
we're not doing that we're not we're not

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,720
just giving you money

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
for our systems we

125
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,799
have smart people that we pay a lot of

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
money to to do a lot of good things

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
and good trainings and those smart

128
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,240
people have backups

129
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
and we can recover these systems and

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
backups where we don't have to pay the

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
baddies anymore right

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,040
buy buy baddies

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
you don't get your monies

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
but then

135
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,919
the bad guys are sad they still want

136
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,120
money

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
right

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
specifically

139
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,400
your money

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
so they decide they get up their game to

141
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,120
match

142
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
they come up with a grand idea

143
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
here's the idea

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
you have

145
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
secrets they could be emails

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
they could be intellectual property

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
they could be

148
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,320
financial data your customer data

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
but typically it's some sort of

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
intellectual property or code maybe you

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
just you have your own

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
application you've built that is your

153
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
intellectual property you might have

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
code

155
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
or

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
you might just have that data maybe it's

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
your data maybe it's your customer's

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
data whatever that might be you have

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
something that is your

160
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
crown jewels that makes

161
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
your business tick and go round

162
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
so they decide let's take that data and

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
we're gonna make it public we're gonna

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
throw it on the internet

165
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
right

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
hey listen i want money from you

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
if you don't give me your money i'm

168
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,039
gonna put your data on the internet

169
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,880
that will negate your people and your

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
backups

171
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
so that is this grandiose plan b

172
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,919
to get your money so how do they do that

173
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,800
they

174
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
instead of going right to impact when we

175
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
jump to impact scrolls and crossbones

176
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
big explosions terminator 2

177
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
we do collection so the attackers are

178
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,479
going to collect

179
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,880
data

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,039
come up with uh some sort of command and

181
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
control in most situations sometimes

182
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,440
they just jump right to x-fil but most

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
of the time there's some sort of command

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,479
and control that's going to send this

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,919
data out or maintain persistence through

186
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
a network usually cobalt strike beacons

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
beacons

188
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
and then they're going to x-fill this

189
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,319
data

190
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,199
they're going to take that data and

191
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,919
they're going to get it out of the

192
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,639
network however they can sometimes it's

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
as easy as they're just shoving in out

194
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,759
through their c2

195
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,360
sometimes they're doing all sorts of

196
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,960
creative things

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
dns tunneling ftp tunneling whatever's

198
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
needed to get it out

199
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
sometimes they're just using google

200
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
drive

201
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,360
there it goes

202
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
really fancy situations apts they've

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
used the orgs backup systems to get it

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
out

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
into another data center to then exfil

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
where outbound is allowed

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
lots of exfil options

208
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
so what is the impact after that the

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,919
impact is they throw up these scary

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,240
websites and say hey orgs

211
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
i have your data here's proof i have

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
your data here's some snippets and how

213
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
many gigabits and the file names of

214
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
these datas

215
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
would you like those to go public

216
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
or you want to give us the money

217
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
and it's not one scary site

218
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,759
there's lots and lots and lots of these

219
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
scary sites

220
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
and lots and lots and we could probably

221
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
spend all day talking about all the

222
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,880
variants that exist

223
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,159
but there is a ton of these out there

224
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,360
scary scary scary sites gonna sell your

225
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
data

226
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
okay so google just released this this

227
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
is from virustotal and they said hey in

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
the last year of all the malwares that

229
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,080
have been submitted to us these are the

230
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
ransomware families there's been 80

231
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
million samples of ransomware submitted

232
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,000
to us in the last year and from 130

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
different ransomware families so those

234
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
scary sites that it looked like there

235
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
was a ton there's even more

236
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
there's more than that there's a lot

237
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,560
that exists

238
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
there's it my mic there's websites that

239
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,360
are completely out there that are just

240
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,199
devoted to telling you

241
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
ransomware sites that i showed you those

242
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
scary sites which ones are up or down on

243
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
dot onion so you can see like hey the

244
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
site's up this site's not

245
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
there's github repos that will tell you

246
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
additional things about those families

247
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
that exist and the of course the google

248
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
virus total one as well

249
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
there's android variants of it this one

250
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
was pretty hot for a minute um right run

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
covet hit as a

252
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
covid tracer you need access you know to

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,599
developer mode and admin mode and

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
so android variants there's mac variants

255
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
of ransomware so hey i got a mac i'm not

256
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
going to get ransomware

257
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,160
they got options for you too don't worry

258
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
this one was an interesting one this was

259
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
a decrypter on the internet but the

260
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
decrypter actually was another

261
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,240
ransomware so you went to go and decrypt

262
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
your ransomware and you ran somewhere

263
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
you ran somewhere so you got to pay

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
somebody to pay somebody

265
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
there are sites that are devoted out

266
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
there to

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
showing you decryption of ransomware but

268
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
they're by security companies not like a

269
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
random google thing

270
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
they do exist and they're usually

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,000
typically because there's a flaw in how

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,839
they implemented the ransomware if you

273
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
implement the ransomware incorrectly

274
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
somebody finds it they'll put out

275
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
decryption keys for it but i wouldn't

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
just google deja vu decrypter

277
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
because then you might ransomware the

278
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,880
ransomware and be in a worse state than

279
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
you were when you started

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
there's entire systems out there called

281
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
ras we've we've we've given them really

282
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
cool sexy names like sass but rasp

283
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
ransomware as a service

284
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,200
so

285
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
you you're an entrepreneur you're like

286
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
i'd really like to get in on this

287
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
ransomware game but uh

288
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
i'm not a developer i'm just really good

289
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
at the uh attacking part or

290
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
entrepreneurial part

291
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
there's entire systems out there just

292
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,320
rest and they have good customer support

293
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
better than like my cable company

294
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
you can call them up they'll help you

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
walk through how to get bitcoin though

296
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
it's a full-fledged service suite but

297
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
they can implement the software there's

298
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
affiliate stuff we'll get to later

299
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
but there's this whole system around ras

300
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
oh hi affiliates here it is so i mean

301
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
utah we're

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
i mean i shouldn't have to explain

303
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
affiliates too much in utah um we're the

304
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,200
capital of affiliates

305
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
right

306
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
so

307
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
there's entire systems out there and i

308
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
saw one that was really aggressive of

309
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
ransomware that's talking a 9010 split

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
they're only going to take 10 percent

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
most are typically 60 40ish

312
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
and what it is is that you sign up for

313
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
some sort of ras or maybe not even a

314
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
rest maybe you just somebody made really

315
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,079
good ransomware i'm going to go deploy

316
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
it by that by

317
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,839
them writing the software and me

318
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
deploying it i'm going to get a 40 cut

319
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
or a 60 cut they're gonna get a 40

320
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
cutter 60 cut we're just going to

321
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
combine our powers to go

322
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,079
sometimes they maintain another back

323
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
door to it which is a little more

324
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
interesting

325
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
and my firewall is like

326
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
no

327
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
sorry about that

328
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,040
you guys all uh whitelist every outbound

329
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,720
connection right no i do it saying con

330
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
so yeah affiliates there's lots of

331
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,519
affiliate programs

332
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,360
so what orgs and what industries does

333
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
ransomware affect

334
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,880
oh

335
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
i haven't heard of one that it doesn't

336
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
um when i first started doing ransomware

337
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,360
presentations we used to talk about like

338
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
these industries

339
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
these are the ones that are most after

340
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,240
there are like i mean colleges k-12s

341
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
getting wrecked hospitals medicals

342
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
getting wrecked

343
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,160
but everybody's getting wrecked so it's

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,880
everything all orgs all industries and

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
the types of data that it encrypts

346
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
everything it can

347
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
every single thing there's this trend

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
right now they're talking about

349
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
harvesters and the random things that

350
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
they scoop up inside their fields

351
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
possums and cats and deers and

352
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,600
picture that being your thumb drives

353
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
your backups your shadow copies anything

354
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
that it possibly can

355
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,000
right over it absolutely will some are

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
just scripts and are dumber than others

357
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
some will miss blatant things and then

358
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,200
some will get

359
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
all

360
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
and it is so so much money the first

361
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
time i ever did a dedicated ransomware

362
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
presentation was 2016

363
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
and they were talking about the numbers

364
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
being around a billion dollars of

365
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
ransomware that year

366
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
and now the highest estimate i saw

367
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
for the last 52 weeks was around 20

368
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,680
billion

369
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
the thing is we don't know

370
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
right there was a recent blog post that

371
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
was put out

372
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
that our government released that there

373
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,279
was 5.2 billion dollars that they

374
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
tracked over the last decade to certain

375
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
bitcoin wallets for just ransomware

376
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,399
so we know that we know over a decade

377
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,240
has been 5.2 billion dollars

378
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
but it's probably way higher that's only

379
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
bitcoin and it's only known addresses

380
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,399
there is other tools out there monero

381
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,519
being one of the other hot ones for

382
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
ransomware

383
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,120
uh cryptocurrency that exists and

384
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
there's been some really really big

385
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
payouts

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
right we've heard of the ones colonial

387
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
pipeline

388
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
lots of money we'll talk about that in a

389
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
minute for the tinfoil hat part of this

390
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,959
um how they got the money back but

391
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,320
there's there's ones from that there's

392
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,639
colleges k-12s there's oil companies

393
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
there's meat packing plants some of

394
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,839
these are 20 million dollars some are 50

395
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
million dollars single payout one org

396
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
compromised here's 50 million dollars

397
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
it's big big money is it 20 billion

398
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,880
dollars

399
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,079
i don't know

400
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,639
it's more than a billion

401
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,720
and uh the very first slide deck oh if

402
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
you saw my keynote the very first slide

403
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
deck i had on security awareness

404
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
training i had one little snippet that

405
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,839
said like

406
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,600
ransomware one slide

407
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,760
because bitcoin wasn't a thing yet we

408
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
didn't know a year later bitcoin comes

409
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
out

410
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,279
from 2011 to 2016 a billion dollars

411
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,360
that's a great hockey stick for you know

412
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
return on your investment zero to a

413
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,839
billion yeah and maybe it's 20 billion

414
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,680
now it's a lot of money it's a

415
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
ridiculous amount of money

416
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
and there is a gamble on your recovery

417
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
there's a really good case study out

418
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
there if you just want to google atlanta

419
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
city recovery costs from ransomware

420
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,519
that'd be a great thing to google

421
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
they this was 2017 they got hit with

422
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
ransomware and they asked for like 51

423
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
000

424
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,000
to get their stuff back and they're like

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
no we got people we got backups we're

426
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,920
not paying that

427
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,720
and they have spent um

428
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
something like 17 million dollars on

429
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
their recovery

430
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
is i don't know whoever googled that you

431
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
can spot check that

432
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,680
i think it was like 17 million dollars

433
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
now

434
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
the other part of me who came from i.t

435
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
and standing up infrastructures is going

436
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
to say yeah but they had a ton of like

437
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,079
deferred

438
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,760
you know stuff they weren't doing that

439
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
they used as an opportunity to upgrade

440
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,320
lots of systems probably totally true

441
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
but in that scenario 51 000 17 million

442
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,639
that is an executive decision to be made

443
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,240
but they probably did a lot of upgrades

444
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
in that as well

445
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
so what's new you're like okay pope

446
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
listed like ransomware's not sexy or fun

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,519
and

448
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,360
we already know all these things

449
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,639
yes they make a lot of money they

450
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,399
encrypt all the things so what's new

451
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
with ransomware

452
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
they're now starting auctioning your

453
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
data so they've decided hey if you have

454
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
backups and you have people and we ex

455
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
filled your files

456
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
and you decide you're not gonna pay

457
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,759
still like you know i don't care

458
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
i'm not paying like well maybe somebody

459
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,399
will pay we did the work right

460
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,240
the work's done we ran somewhere the

461
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,959
files we x-filled them

462
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,120
if you won't pay will your competitors

463
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
pay will somebody else pay

464
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
so they're starting to i don't know how

465
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,480
else will take off

466
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
mainly because

467
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
if you don't pay could you just buy your

468
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,399
own stuff at a cheaper rate

469
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,279
maybe

470
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
right but maybe it'll be a higher rate

471
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
it depends what's in the files so this

472
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
one could be a thing um but it is new

473
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
they're starting to auction off files

474
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
they're also now going after your

475
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
customers

476
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,079
so there was a uh

477
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
this link at the bottom it's just a

478
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
reference for me to remind to tell you

479
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
and it's the scariest one just so i'll

480
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
mention it there's other ones that exist

481
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,639
as well this was a finnish

482
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,320
mental health clinic that got ransomware

483
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
they decided they weren't going to pay

484
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,839
we're not paying this ransomware

485
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,279
so they started calling up all their

486
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,959
customers hey

487
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,720
we know you're crazy

488
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,320
we have your files

489
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,680
would your family like to know you're

490
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
crazy

491
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,959
and they were charging 300 to a thousand

492
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,959
dollars per person to to not put it out

493
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,880
on the internet

494
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
so there's also variance of that okay

495
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,160
maybe it's not like a direct customer

496
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
like a mental health clinic but maybe

497
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
it's your third party all the things

498
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
that you're tied into api vpn wise that

499
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
they have their data oh well you're not

500
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,079
going to pay but you're tied into these

501
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
guys and i got their sensitive data

502
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
maybe they'll pay

503
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
and they'll put the blame on you

504
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
leverage

505
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
so third-party attacks

506
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
we have a new term that we've christened

507
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,799
this year

508
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
we're calling it kill ware i don't know

509
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
if i like the term or not and the sad

510
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,760
part is we release kill ware

511
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,520
or the term of it

512
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,919
and the argument in the infosec isn't

513
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,480
like how bad and scary this is and how

514
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
we need to stop this happening from

515
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,319
hospitals it's like no that wasn't the

516
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,280
first one there was ones before that and

517
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
killware is somewhat that gets

518
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
ransomware typically medical

519
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,840
and somebody died because of it

520
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
so if you don't know what that term is

521
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
hopefully it doesn't stick because

522
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
hopefully it's not going to be a thing i

523
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
hope it's not like that slide from 2011

524
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,360
like

525
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
killware interesting and then now

526
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,919
everybody's dying of killer hope it's

527
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,200
not that

528
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
but it does exist and the argument is

529
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
this is not the first death that

530
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
happened because of ransomware and

531
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
that's scary by itself

532
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
typically it's happening because of a

533
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
hospital hospital gets ransomware

534
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
somebody's in need some treatment

535
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
cancer kidneys stuff like that and they

536
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
can't help them because all their

537
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
machines are locked up so they transfer

538
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
them somewhere else and in that process

539
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
that person dies

540
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
this has been hypothesized to get

541
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,320
scarier in the future as more things

542
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,360
like pacemakers become remote controlled

543
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
by bluetooth and other things and how

544
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
you could potentially spike or shut that

545
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,679
off

546
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,880
so

547
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
killware

548
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
we have laws that are all trying i mean

549
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,120
this is our government they you know

550
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,440
technology and government is always this

551
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
battle of

552
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
10 20 30 years behind or applying

553
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
existing laws to maybe match something

554
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
that is happening

555
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
uh but there's a whole bunch out there

556
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
there's some legislation about uh hey

557
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,000
all orgs are required to report

558
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,679
ransomware within 48 hours of it

559
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,600
happening

560
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,960
but i went and looked at that lie it's

561
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
super loose

562
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
they they really just want to know and

563
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,679
it's you know it's not an actual law yet

564
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,120
that's just a proposal

565
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
and i'm sure it'll get built out into

566
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
something crazy but they just want to

567
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
know did you get ransomware to what

568
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
family it was did you make payments and

569
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
the big one is do you get any payments

570
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
from the government on ransomware

571
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
just got lit up do you get any payments

572
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
from the government they want to know if

573
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
government money essentially to your

574
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
order got used to pay ransomware that

575
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
looks like the objective of what i read

576
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
out of that um some lawyer would have a

577
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,960
better interpretation than i would of

578
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
that

579
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
there's also a lot of uh stuff the white

580
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,080
house put out a bunch of information on

581
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
anti-ransomware

582
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,960
they're they have entire discussions uh

583
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
and and things that are getting put out

584
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
saying you as an org are not allowed to

585
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
pay

586
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,160
a terrorist group for ransomware

587
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
it's like that that sounds totally fine

588
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
right we don't want to fund terrorism i

589
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,799
get that

590
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,080
but then it's like how do you know

591
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
how do i know if i'm funding terrorism

592
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
and the problem is you don't nobody does

593
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
so what it has done is spun up an entire

594
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,880
other middleman industry of orgs lawyers

595
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
are going to pay

596
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
lawyers in

597
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
external to the u.s

598
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
panama anywhere else

599
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,799
morocco pay those lawyers to make the

600
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,320
ransomware payment

601
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
so we've added a whole other industry of

602
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
middlemen to avoid because then you can

603
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
say i definitely did not pay a terrorist

604
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,440
group

605
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
i paid lawyers in panama they may or may

606
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
not have paid terrorist group we don't

607
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,039
know you got to talk to them oh they're

608
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,200
not in your jurisdiction okay cool

609
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
america

610
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
all right so we're talking look a

611
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
non-giffy slide deck sorry my bad um

612
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
ttp's tactics techniques and procedures

613
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,360
of ransomware there's a few things i

614
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
wanted to point out here there's a

615
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
really good blog post that was put out

616
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
uh andrew brown who's actually like you

617
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
know a utah og so it's worth a read it

618
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
was a three hours to ransomwares like a

619
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
sofas sofos post

620
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,679
and the cool thing about that one was uh

621
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,600
it was just going after it was patch

622
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
patch management but there was a

623
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,679
vulnerability in vcenter and vsphere and

624
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
they just took that and leveraged that

625
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,400
to get into the whole infrastructure and

626
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
go

627
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
so there's some of these that they're in

628
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
there a long time they're waiting for

629
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
the right moment to tip i've also heard

630
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,039
other reports and news of orgs that

631
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
are blaming security tools it's like an

632
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,320
interesting use case

633
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
they go install like a brand new edr xdr

634
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,760
tool

635
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,039
and within 24 hours they get ransomware

636
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,039
and they're like hey these xdr tools

637
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,559
like something's in them they're bad we

638
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,000
got ransomware

639
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,679
and every time they get researched and

640
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,120
done because of course everybody's

641
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
interested in that ir report

642
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,679
is that they're already there

643
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,880
they're planning their you know that

644
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,400
evasion you know spider-man jumping

645
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
around they're just avoiding you you

646
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,120
don't know they're there

647
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,039
and they see you installing a visibility

648
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,559
tool

649
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
that's going to help you find them

650
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
and they decide it's go time like hey i

651
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
don't want to get found i need to get

652
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,799
paid so it's go time

653
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
so there's there's some of that also

654
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
mitre attack is who here knows what

655
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
miter attack is

656
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,559
all right we got third ish and then the

657
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
rest is sleeping so that's cool so um

658
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,720
mitre attack

659
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,360
if you want to know the ttps of how this

660
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
works there's a link there in the bottom

661
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
but just type miter tech like maze

662
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
m-a-z-e or pick any ransomware name and

663
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,000
some of these have fancy apt group names

664
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
some don't

665
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
but in the use case of maze you're going

666
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,320
to plug it in and it's going to tell you

667
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,919
every method and tool that they use

668
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,679
that's a great way for ttps how would

669
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,640
they get in how would they pivot move

670
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
how would they execute is this an

671
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
all-inclusive list of all the things

672
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,720
pretty close of known things

673
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,559
that's that's the important part there's

674
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,320
plenty of things that are unknown a wait

675
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,159
you have to wait until an ir report or

676
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
something comes out on it and then they

677
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
add it to that list oh do they use

678
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
lasagna to get credentials out of

679
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,840
browsers and ssh keys once confirmed

680
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,919
they do it gets added to their list so

681
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,880
if you want to pull up a single

682
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
ransomware group hey this one's hitting

683
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,039
the news a lot i'm going to go to mitre

684
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,559
put in that ransomware group's name and

685
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
i'm going to see all their ttps of how

686
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,159
they go about it in an organization and

687
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,039
then i want to make sure i have

688
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
visibility i'm jumping ahead that's

689
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,679
later

690
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
all right miter attack ttps and then

691
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,600
there's lots of living off the land

692
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
tools these are the hardest ones to find

693
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,679
because they mirror

694
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
what they're made for it's linux tools

695
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,200
windows tools the ways things are built

696
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,360
and criminals use those but then there's

697
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
just blatantly ones that are not that as

698
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
well

699
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
tools like this anybody who knows what

700
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
this is

701
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
i worked really hard on this

702
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,080
cobalt strike thank you one person in

703
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
the room

704
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
this one is in all the organizations i

705
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,559
didn't i didn't make a fancy one for a

706
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,240
responder or bloodhound um those two get

707
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
used a lot cobalt strike it's used a lot

708
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
and this one this one kinda has a prereq

709
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
to have kids to know this one anybody

710
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,720
know this one

711
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,480
mimi cats you have kids right all right

712
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
so the uh this left side is mimi is love

713
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
so it does you know a little prereq for

714
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,679
kids

715
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,640
mimikatz is in a lot of these as well

716
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,919
and there's a lot of tools that are like

717
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
hey we detect the mimikats right out the

718
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
bat

719
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
yes and no

720
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,640
um mimikatz uses windows calls

721
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
so there are ways to repackage it to

722
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
avoid those some as simple as just

723
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,360
repackage it and change the hash some

724
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
more complex behavioral analytics as

725
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,720
well

726
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
and then there's straight up i can just

727
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
make those same calls not using me cats

728
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
as well

729
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,919
all right so what do you do i'm up here

730
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,120
telling you all the new things and bad

731
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
things so let's talk about some things

732
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
we can do

733
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
as defenders of orgs

734
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
we

735
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
need people

736
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
right you guys we need defenders so some

737
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
orgs have no defenders it's really hard

738
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
to defend against ransomware when

739
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
there's nobody to defend against

740
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,120
ransomware

741
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
so you're all here so i assume that we

742
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
have the people part checked but maybe

743
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
on your team you need more people

744
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
probably valid right

745
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,640
we need training hey look you're here

746
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
you're in a training right

747
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,640
you're here doing this thing this is not

748
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
just security training no phishing

749
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
awareness training everybody in the

750
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
entire org is security training

751
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,840
etc etc training on tools tactics

752
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,679
techniques knowledge etc

753
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,440
and i asked everybody to raise their

754
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
hand who here knew what mitre attack was

755
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
and we had a third ish now that you sat

756
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,480
through this it's a hundred percent you

757
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,039
just went through an entire flow

758
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,640
of miter tech i snuck in subquest

759
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
you got an entire training on the miter

760
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
attack this is how we went through on

761
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,799
our giphys from recon all the way to

762
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,360
impact each of these steps of how they

763
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
go through it

764
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
there's other frameworks out there

765
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,360
fireeye has a really good one if you

766
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,279
don't like the miter one sometimes the

767
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
reason i did this is miter

768
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,080
i i like it a lot and i show people the

769
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,520
site go to mitre and there's these

770
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,039
columns and buckets and it goes all the

771
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,679
way from you know recon all or discovery

772
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,600
recon etc all the way down to impact and

773
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,919
they just get like scared of it there's

774
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
too much data especially if they blow

775
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
out the sub techniques

776
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,039
and they're just mine's like there's so

777
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,799
much data in here

778
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
but when you simplify it

779
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
from recon to gaining a foothold to

780
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
going it's much more easy to understand

781
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
there's also like the boeing kill chain

782
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
and fire eye so pick your one

783
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
um essentially these don't happen in a

784
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
waterfall it's not like the ransomware

785
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
shop is like sorry

786
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
i already moved on to a collection so

787
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,559
i'm not going to do any more discovery

788
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
i'm not going to do any more enumeration

789
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,200
no that's not how it works they're not a

790
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,760
waterfall shop if they're in there and

791
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
they're on one of these steps

792
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
they're absolutely continuing with

793
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
scripts or themselves going to past

794
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,000
steps getting data doing more things

795
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
with that data

796
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,559
i did skip it's in the very bottom right

797
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,760
and it's intentionally supposed to be

798
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,679
hard to see i did skip

799
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
resource development on that phase

800
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,760
google that on your own then you can say

801
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
you officially have done through the

802
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,719
it's just not that fun to talk about

803
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
but yes mitre attack you've now also now

804
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,159
assumed says who knows what a miter

805
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,679
attack uh

806
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,960
kill chain framework whatever you want

807
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
to call it is everybody should raise

808
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,679
their hand because you all have sat

809
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,360
through it

810
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
so what can we do this is obviously the

811
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,159
most important one we talked about

812
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,919
earlier we need backups

813
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,200
if you don't have a backup you can't

814
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,799
restore from anything

815
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,880
i would add a few caveats to that you

816
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,440
want revision control incrementals and

817
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,559
you probably want some off-site as well

818
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
if nothing more than a fire burns it

819
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
down and you can get it back but

820
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,240
sometimes that fire is ransomware and it

821
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
burns down everything you have locally

822
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,640
depending on how you're writing it

823
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
but there's a lot of cloud providers or

824
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
you can do it yourself

825
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,159
offsite revision control

826
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
typically big orgs will want on-site as

827
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
well for faster recovery because if

828
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,679
you're trying to download terabytes from

829
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
the cloud

830
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
you've you're you know you've screwed

831
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,840
yourself a little bit

832
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
all right these are the two big ones

833
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
that i'm going to pull out

834
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,200
the left side is

835
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,799
when i went around and did pitch decks

836
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,399
and talking about how to remove local

837
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
admin this is one of the things i would

838
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
always show people right so if you're

839
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
pulling up a tool

840
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,840
um in this case it's meterpreter and

841
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
you're trying to go from a system where

842
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
you have

843
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
uh admin on it

844
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,799
and you're trying to get stuff out of

845
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,279
clear text like me cats or whatever go

846
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,760
go to full root system

847
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,000
it was a trivia not in all situations

848
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
but in some situations absolutely is

849
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,480
trivial is just typing get system get

850
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
system okay

851
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,440
you're not you've been moved up from a

852
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,600
local admin to a full system here you go

853
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,039
here's all the memory and clear text you

854
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,399
can do whatever you want with it you are

855
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,719
system

856
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
highly highly advocate not running as

857
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,840
administrator

858
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,600
my own machine i don't run as

859
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
administrator

860
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
i am the administrator

861
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
right i have that credential

862
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,799
but i am weary of what my machine does

863
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,200
we hire somebody for a position we trust

864
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,960
that person to do the position i don't

865
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
trust their computer

866
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,679
and the things that happen on that

867
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,279
computer

868
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,039
so anytime that you can get rid of

869
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,159
administrator rights do so

870
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,679
you could still have them if you need

871
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,480
them

872
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
better yet to have i.t have them or

873
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,880
somebody else privileged

874
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,200
but not running administrator is huge

875
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
for ransomware

876
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,320
so if you're not administrator it's just

877
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
going to ransomware their profile or

878
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
something small that's contained and the

879
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,279
things they can write to which leads to

880
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,000
the

881
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
right hand side of that

882
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,799
which is

883
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,640
limit the access of the things you can

884
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,960
read and write to your job

885
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,200
and i know it sounds really simple

886
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
but i can't tell you how many orgs i

887
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,279
walk into and that is not the case

888
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
somebody in finance has access to all

889
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,840
the i.t right you know they just have

890
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,080
hr has access to all the things

891
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,000
what do you need to do your job

892
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,679
and let's break that out into the file

893
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,279
share of what you need to accomplish

894
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,399
your job

895
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,000
you shouldn't be able to see the admin

896
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
folder and write to the admin folder and

897
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
it's not because we don't trust that

898
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
person i just don't trust the machine

899
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,399
and the things you can write too

900
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
obviously we want the person to do their

901
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,840
job that's why they're hired we don't

902
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,679
want to limit their access

903
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
but if that's not their job they

904
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
shouldn't have access to all those

905
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,760
things

906
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
it's just you're just asking for

907
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
oh they got fished

908
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
and had admin and just wrote over

909
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,440
everything and because they had admin

910
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,399
you can't revert it back so

911
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
these two it's one slide

912
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,840
and this is like the hardest part like

913
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
i'm showing you one slide but getting

914
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,679
rid of admin access and need to know

915
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,039
it sounds really easy to say those two

916
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,480
things just get rid of adam and access

917
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
need to know but this is painful i've

918
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,080
done this in blue team this is one of

919
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
the hardest things you'll do

920
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,080
and i'm literally giving you like a two

921
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,279
minute section on it and there's gonna

922
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,200
be like hundreds of hours of work and

923
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
some works to pull off

924
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
i would highly recommend

925
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,559
start small

926
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
don't try to get rid of local admin

927
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
across the entire org at once

928
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,399
you will absolutely have somebody in a

929
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,559
water cooler next to an executive saying

930
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,480
how this sucks and it's screwing them

931
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,039
over and they'll be like yeah

932
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,640
you can't do that

933
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
and it will kill your whole initiative

934
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,039
i know i've done it

935
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,279
that's exactly how it goes but you can

936
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
phase roll it out

937
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,120
okay we're gonna do finance department

938
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
they don't ever install other software

939
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
or shouldn't hopefully right they have a

940
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,039
set list of things to do their job

941
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,320
we already see what's on there it's

942
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
benchmarked we have it documented

943
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,000
hopefully

944
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,440
we're gonna remove local admin from

945
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
finance we're gonna call the help desk

946
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
team and say hey you might get more

947
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,519
support calls this week next week while

948
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
this happens somebody's going to try to

949
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,600
do something that maybe they're always

950
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,679
launching a program as a local admin for

951
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,039
some reason

952
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,960
some reason because documentation said

953
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,399
to do it usually

954
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,519
and

955
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,960
we need to be prepared to handle that

956
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,399
and here's some ways we can install it

957
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,720
properly or reinstall etc go through

958
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
that exercise let that bake in until

959
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
there's no more calls from it

960
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,559
then roll it to the next apartment roll

961
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
it to the next department it's going to

962
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,919
take a while but once you get there

963
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
you'll be running an org without admin

964
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,279
highly highly recommend doing that

965
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,039
do your executive team last i know it

966
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,679
sounds like they should be first but

967
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,039
it's a much at least from my experience

968
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,799
it was much easier to say oh the whole

969
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
company is doing it this way

970
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,399
and it's been doing this way for over a

971
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,720
year since the first one we started it

972
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
there's any reason you guys need that

973
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
it's easier yourself depends on your

974
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,519
admin team and your executive buy-in

975
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,799
sometimes you have to play a little more

976
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,760
pr

977
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,919
sometimes you can just do it the hardest

978
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,120
two is going to be your developers and

979
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,000
your security folk

980
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,039
system admins too i t big bucket people

981
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,039
those are going to be your hardest ones

982
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,480
in those scenarios i would recommend

983
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
some sort of a jump box or some sort of

984
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,159
thing that when i'm looking at network

985
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,200
traffic and edr traffic and it is weird

986
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,440
living off the land type of things i can

987
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,760
say that's coming from the jump box not

988
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,679
that's coming from i don't even know

989
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,720
where

990
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
finance that's not right

991
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
right

992
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,559
and yeah the the access one i mean

993
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
that's battles too it seems easy what do

994
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,159
you need to do your job okay here you go

995
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,919
you're in that bucket but there's always

996
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,840
somebody like i've been here for

997
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,320
20 30 years and i've i've access to all

998
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,919
the things and you don't trust me and it

999
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,519
turns into a big political thing as well

1000
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,960
so sometimes you just have to step

1001
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
around that what do you need access to

1002
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,440
okay sure we'll give you that okay

1003
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
she's a separate use case because she's

1004
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
been here 40 years and i don't want to

1005
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
fight that yet let's get the other ones

1006
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:26,960
done

1007
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,600
we'll move to that one later

1008
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,120
oh but if you want access to that you're

1009
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
no longer an admin

1010
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,600
get it on the back end

1011
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
tools

1012
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,000
some tools are better than others for

1013
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,039
this

1014
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,200
vulnerability scanning obviously seems

1015
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
like a reasonable one there's free

1016
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
versions to super expensive paid

1017
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
versions

1018
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,880
fishing

1019
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
tools that are out there

1020
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,080
anti-phishing

1021
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
buckets they put you in edr x i have

1022
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,120
another slide because i know that giphy

1023
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,399
is annoying just to like let it sit

1024
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,919
there

1025
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,880
anti

1026
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,240
anti-phishing xdr edr tools xcr is just

1027
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,039
the

1028
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,640
marketing term for

1029
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,520
edr plus logs or er plus network traffic

1030
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,639
and they're still fighting as to which

1031
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,199
one that means

1032
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,359
regardless some of those some orgs will

1033
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,399
say like okay well our it or sysadmins

1034
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,960
have to be admins so we're just going to

1035
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,040
install like a full

1036
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
xdr with threat hunting package on there

1037
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
to have that as a mitigation so there's

1038
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,719
tools like that exist network traffic

1039
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,800
analysis is your friend obviously some

1040
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,879
sort of sim to put logs in to find out

1041
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,639
where you could even see if maze

1042
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,480
happened across your network

1043
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,399
is a good thing

1044
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
but there's a lot of tools out there

1045
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,760
that exist that will help i'm always

1046
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,000
going to put people before tools

1047
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,440
because you can buy the fanciest most

1048
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,520
expensive bling tools in the world and

1049
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,639
if you don't have competent people how

1050
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
to run or manage them then there's no

1051
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,679
point you're doing it just to check a

1052
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,639
box

1053
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
and you're defeating like the purpose

1054
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
that said a firewall is a good thing

1055
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,520
don't get me wrong

1056
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
you need a firewall micro segmentation

1057
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
is your friend if you can segment off

1058
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,880
finance

1059
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,839
and it gets ransomware

1060
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,520
sucks but

1061
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,839
not the whole org right it's not like

1062
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,240
your teleprompters are all down and your

1063
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
whole orgs down you're doing the weather

1064
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
off of a whiteboard right whole org wide

1065
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,359
if you can

1066
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,720
segment off

1067
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,640
those things do that that's a great tool

1068
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
firewall hopefully i'll have it internal

1069
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
firewalls i'm a big fan of anytime you

1070
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
can segment off

1071
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,079
like your voip from your workstations

1072
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,000
good but it's hard because now i gotta

1073
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,359
pull another data line it's easier just

1074
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,640
plug it in the back of the phone run it

1075
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,920
to the computer

1076
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,000
i get it so tools there's lots of tools

1077
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
out there

1078
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,040
find tools that make sense of it i'm

1079
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
always a big fan of visibility so bass i

1080
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
don't know bad stuff is breach

1081
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
assessment software

1082
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
it's where you run something against

1083
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
your system and see if you can see it

1084
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
that's a good sanity check if your tools

1085
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,760
work the way you expect

1086
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
there's paid ones of those that are

1087
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,720
super expensive that you could also do

1088
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,160
they're actually downstairs atomic red

1089
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,359
team

1090
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
oh this guy this guy right here we gotta

1091
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,560
tell my great team right here

1092
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
there's free ones of those on the

1093
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
endpoint and i've used those lots of

1094
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
times they have a site just atomic red

1095
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,599
team testing

1096
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,599
the first one i think is like reg server

1097
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,520
dll32

1098
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,119
you can launch that again don't do this

1099
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,720
in your production

1100
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
spin up something with your same

1101
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
visibility tools try it see if you can

1102
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
see it

1103
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
right instead of saying like oh we're

1104
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
good to go and ransomware let's check

1105
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
some things so that's kind of your later

1106
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,720
stages start with just your

1107
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,160
start start with just like having a

1108
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,240
firewall like right let's move to

1109
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,320
endpoint network traffic things like

1110
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
that logical flow and i do want some

1111
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
sort of a sim to put them into and i

1112
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,599
know sims get expensive when you ingest

1113
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,359
a bunch of data but there's lots of free

1114
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,280
and paid versions out there i'm not

1115
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,640
trying to sell you any particular

1116
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,320
product here but there are like

1117
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,760
typically free options that require

1118
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
labor to maintain there's paid options

1119
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,119
some of them also require labor to

1120
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,520
maintain

1121
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,280
patch obviously this is like

1122
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
seems simple again it's like that stuff

1123
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,480
like i'm going to give you a one

1124
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,079
sentence one word thing patch your

1125
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,000
systems it's really easy if you sat to

1126
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,640
the keynote you'll know that i

1127
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,440
i know the pain of patching it is uh

1128
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,680
hard in some situations it's also easy

1129
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,520
in some situations

1130
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,760
the more the more that tools are moving

1131
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,520
to devops tools

1132
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
like hey we just stand up this

1133
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,400
environment with terraform and ansible

1134
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
the easier this is

1135
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
people just expect boxes that they can

1136
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,200
just spin up and part of that spin up

1137
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
process i'm just going to patch it and

1138
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
it's going to run a bunch of checks when

1139
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,359
it's done if it fails a check it's just

1140
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,480
going to revert it

1141
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,880
that has made this much better

1142
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
more orgs that i see that we go into and

1143
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
i'm like patch i'm like oh yeah it's

1144
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,839
just built into our development cycle

1145
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,200
that's amazing

1146
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,320
that's great

1147
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,640
because people like that vmware one that

1148
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
was a known thing

1149
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,240
just walk through that door right landed

1150
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,040
on a box hit their their their stack

1151
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
known vulnerability that was already a

1152
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
patch out for

1153
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,839
but whoever who's ever tried to apply

1154
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,560
one of those patches those ones are

1155
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
these center patches a mess

1156
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,880
but yeah patch

1157
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,280
seems simple but especially external

1158
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
facing things and your critical assets

1159
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
you got to patch those

1160
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
and if you can't

1161
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
you need some sort of mitigation in

1162
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
front of it you run a big hospital

1163
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,400
system and you got some super expensive

1164
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
mri thing that can't get patched and

1165
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,520
it's running off this million dollar

1166
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,119
machine

1167
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,200
firewall in front of that restrict you

1168
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,920
know layer seven if i could to the exact

1169
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
application and i would even do it

1170
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,480
directionality

1171
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,400
databases this is the other thing an api

1172
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,359
access so much so much of that is like i

1173
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,720
don't know to make it work i just gave

1174
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,599
them read write on an admin

1175
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,480
well

1176
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,880
that's like a ransomware like gravy

1177
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,079
train

1178
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,599
uh you get access to this and it has

1179
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,680
read write as an admin into the database

1180
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,560
okay

1181
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
well they're definitely going to encrypt

1182
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
that

1183
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,200
anytime you can sit down and figure out

1184
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,119
how something works it only needs to

1185
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,079
read

1186
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,680
make a separate user that only reads

1187
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,960
don't give it right if it doesn't need

1188
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,000
right

1189
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
same with directionality if you get the

1190
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
firewalls down don't let it talk this

1191
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
way if it never needs to talk that way

1192
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
it just needs to reach in cool just

1193
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
needs to reach out cool if i can do that

1194
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,320
layer seven even better

1195
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,040
white listing or approved list something

1196
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
for like windows domain without layer

1197
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
seven really hard it's really hard layer

1198
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
seven much easier it needs smb mapping

1199
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,240
smb file transfer

1200
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,599
one direction

1201
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,560
it never needs to come this way i'm just

1202
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,680
giving you one say i know it's really

1203
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,000
hard don't don't get me wrong

1204
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,599
and the government is here to help right

1205
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,920
we there is legitimately great

1206
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,839
information off the cisa website on

1207
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,440
ransomware and it is getting better

1208
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
and i probably wouldn't have said that

1209
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
two years ago

1210
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,240
i would have been like

1211
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
government's just not quite but the cisa

1212
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,320
ransomware has a lot of great

1213
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,160
information on it highly recommend going

1214
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,599
to it you could do an entire training

1215
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,480
class just using that data

1216
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,960
so the government really is here to help

1217
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
parts of it

1218
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
maybe a team of three people or

1219
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
something

1220
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
red tim red team pen test so that bass

1221
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,160
stuff kind of bridges that line into

1222
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,240
what a red team is

1223
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
but any time i'm ever doing an

1224
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,599
engagement like oh we're doing a red

1225
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
team or we're doing a pen test

1226
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,760
for some compliance

1227
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,680
pci whatever else we're bringing some

1228
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,000
team into it i'm always working with the

1229
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
blue team of like let's see what we can

1230
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,200
see not that we're going to stop it

1231
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,560
depending on the engagement sometimes

1232
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,920
we're not whack-a-mole sometimes we're

1233
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,599
just but i want to be able to make sure

1234
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,119
we can see it

1235
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,040
do we have visibility of to what they

1236
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,920
did and how they did it and if we don't

1237
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
then there is no point of doing

1238
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,920
bluetooth red team pen test if you don't

1239
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,520
have that visibility you're just gonna

1240
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,240
like

1241
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,319
repeat that red team or pen test

1242
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,599
exercise every year it's just like

1243
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,800
getting hit with a sledgehammer every

1244
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
year and you can't do anything about it

1245
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,560
and then when anything happens like

1246
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
ransomware and incident

1247
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,319
you don't know we have no logs for it we

1248
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,000
don't see it

1249
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,280
so use that to your advantage when that

1250
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,119
happens to actually like

1251
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,359
validate your tools work as expected

1252
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,359
incident response this is where you'll

1253
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,200
probably end up

1254
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
hopefully not

1255
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
but

1256
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
if you have no visibility and

1257
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,720
everybody's admin and all the file

1258
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
shares are shared with everybody then

1259
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,200
more likely you're going to end up here

1260
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,119
ir used to be a thing that you could

1261
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,560
just call up and get

1262
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,079
sometimes it is

1263
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,560
but they are so busy right now and have

1264
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,960
been for the last year

1265
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,520
that uh i'm absolutely hearing orgs that

1266
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,560
have more than one ir retainer

1267
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,000
and even on these engagements they're

1268
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
sending more than one team from multiple

1269
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,040
companies out for them

1270
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,880
typically through your insurance or

1271
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
yourself you probably want to have some

1272
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,280
sort of ir retainer or an internal team

1273
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,640
some orgs have internal teams that's

1274
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,160
even better because you can prioritize

1275
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
them but you want somebody to come and

1276
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,599
tell you what happened how it happened

1277
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,440
and is it gone

1278
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,000
before you try to resume normal

1279
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,839
the sad part is i've heard some

1280
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,720
situations where they pay the ransomware

1281
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,480
and they're like okay we need ir to come

1282
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,319
through right we got our availability

1283
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,400
back up we need ir to come through and

1284
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,079
make sure they're not in our systems and

1285
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,520
they're like no you just spent your

1286
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,680
budget

1287
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,920
on this ransomware payment

1288
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,359
and you're like wait i've been telling

1289
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,359
you to get these tools and things for a

1290
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,560
long time

1291
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,720
hopefully that's not your org some orgs

1292
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
are different they get the breach and

1293
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,839
the checkbooks open up

1294
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,520
so there's kind of a big conflict in

1295
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
those sides

1296
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
but you probably want something in place

1297
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
tabletop exercises what do you do you

1298
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,119
definitely want to plan out

1299
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,119
if we get ransomware

1300
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,760
do we pay don't we pay

1301
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
and that's not as easy as that if we get

1302
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,920
ransomwared and it takes down

1303
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,720
this part do we pay don't we pay i would

1304
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,839
love to sit here and say you should

1305
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,440
never pay ransomware

1306
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,640
because i don't like paying bad people

1307
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
for my stuff and nobody does i don't

1308
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,920
think anybody's like yeah i'd like to

1309
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,960
give bad people money for my stuff

1310
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,560
but there absolutely are situations

1311
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,799
where

1312
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
people pay and i can't i can't argue

1313
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
against them i could have said there's a

1314
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,000
lot of things you could have done

1315
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
beforehand but now that you're in that

1316
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,280
situation

1317
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,800
i don't know i'm not going to give you

1318
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,520
like you you have this direct yes or no

1319
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,599
i wish it was that simple

1320
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,680
but sometimes that's not your data

1321
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,960
sometimes that's your mental health

1322
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,760
patients data

1323
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,680
or

1324
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,359
conti puts out a really good

1325
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,359
documentation on how to improve your

1326
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,200
network so as soon as they infect you

1327
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,960
and take you down and you make your

1328
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,440
payment they release this to you

1329
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,800
hey here's some things you should have

1330
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,240
been doing

1331
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
we're here to help make sure you don't

1332
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,359
get ransomware

1333
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,520
um better email filtering guess how they

1334
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,000
came in better password policies

1335
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,920
consider blocking some particular

1336
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
attacks

1337
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,800
update your internal patch patch

1338
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,640
how about some micro segmentation talked

1339
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,760
about that

1340
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,359
block some kerbero roasting attack

1341
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,599
conduct some pen tests

1342
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,640
implement a better edr and av av is

1343
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,480
actually super interesting uh there's

1344
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,880
some really good blog posts out about

1345
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,280
how many times av has picked up parts of

1346
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,520
ransomware attacks

1347
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,880
post-incident

1348
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,000
they're going back and look at the

1349
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,200
incident at the end they're like let's

1350
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,359
go look at the logs the av tool

1351
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,359
and a lot of the times they did flag on

1352
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,800
parts of it

1353
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
but a lot of people aren't collecting

1354
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,520
the av logs

1355
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,040
and they're not alerting or looking at

1356
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
them

1357
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,640
so that one's interesting right av is

1358
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,240
typically on like adr is usually a

1359
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,400
better scenario than av but av

1360
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,079
has some use as long as they're getting

1361
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,960
essentially logged somewhere and

1362
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
somebody's actually looking at it

1363
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
yeah you know maybe you should restrict

1364
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,240
your need to know and get rid of

1365
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,079
administrative rights sounds like things

1366
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,319
we talked about implement a better dlp

1367
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,720
system dop systems

1368
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
i'm not sold on dlp systems there's

1369
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,160
always some way around them they have

1370
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
their use cases social security numbers

1371
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,440
credit cards if you're doing something

1372
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,960
blatant they work really well i'm sure

1373
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
there's better ones than others

1374
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,160
but i would do a lot of other things

1375
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,599
before i went to dlp but i guess they

1376
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,560
would too it was their number 10.

1377
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,800
you could just buy crypto

1378
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,160
and say you know what pope all the

1379
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,280
things you're saying sound really hard

1380
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
and complicated i'm just gonna like get

1381
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,880
some bitcoin we're just gonna sit on

1382
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,680
that

1383
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,359
and when we need it we're just gonna pay

1384
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,440
it

1385
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,480
so the the tinfoil hat talk part of this

1386
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
is

1387
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,880
why aren't big giant orgs getting

1388
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,560
wrecked

1389
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,920
right i mean definitely things are

1390
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,400
getting wrecked but big giant orgs think

1391
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,920
the big ones do they is it because they

1392
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,599
have better security better security

1393
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,640
teams

1394
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,480
yes i don't disagree

1395
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,079
but like our government we hear all the

1396
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,680
time from our own reports how bad that

1397
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,880
stuff is how come the government's not

1398
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,800
getting around somewhere left and right

1399
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,319
this is just gospel of james at the

1400
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,680
moment i'm just pontificating for a

1401
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,800
second

1402
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
and you know you could shut off at this

1403
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,640
moment

1404
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,400
i think

1405
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,319
ransomware companies is

1406
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,400
companies they're businesses

1407
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,040
they need quick rois

1408
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,319
and they don't want the heat

1409
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,079
they want to see how far they can push

1410
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,240
an industry or something until the heat

1411
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,119
comes

1412
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,599
if i can go for a university

1413
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,240
or a medical and i can get a million 20

1414
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
million 50 million dollar payout without

1415
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,640
the heat coming that's now my benchmark

1416
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,240
of what we can go do

1417
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,760
typically they'll find a vulnerability

1418
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,680
in some sort of system

1419
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,280
and then they'll just do that as many

1420
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,800
times as they can

1421
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,200
right this thing's not patched a vpn a

1422
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,680
firewall whatever that might be

1423
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,680
hit that and go across as many things as

1424
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,480
they can every industry every org

1425
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,240
colonial pipeline i would argue was an

1426
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,440
accident

1427
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,280
it was not intentional for them to do

1428
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,520
that because it brought the heat there

1429
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,040
was some things released later saying

1430
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,560
like we didn't mean to the problem is we

1431
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,800
don't know who that is

1432
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,880
is that real or not real we do know the

1433
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,160
government got a lot of that money back

1434
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,319
and their official advice is

1435
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,520
only make ransomware payments in bitcoin

1436
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,040
which is a whole other conspiracy theory

1437
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,480
for another day

1438
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,839
don't make it another cryptocurrency

1439
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,920
just bitcoin

1440
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,079
we'll leave that one sitting but i think

1441
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,520
the reason our government isn't getting

1442
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
ransomware

1443
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,240
because they don't want the heat of it

1444
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,800
the difference between cyber war which

1445
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,200
is another terror whatever cyber war and

1446
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,400
actual war

1447
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,920
is disruption

1448
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,440
and ransomware by definition is

1449
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,200
disruption

1450
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,680
but if it's just a university

1451
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,040
and at the end of the day does that

1452
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,720
impact you does that impact you if some

1453
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,480
university gets wrecked and you make a

1454
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,000
20 million payment does that affect you

1455
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,720
no

1456
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,000
you don't care

1457
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,760
just makes a news okay cool and maybe

1458
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,000
you don't even see it gas prices go up

1459
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,400
because of it oh no

1460
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,960
it impacts everybody everybody's pissed

1461
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
right

1462
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
so i would argue the colonial pipeline

1463
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,280
was probably an accident the

1464
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,640
vulnerability they found in some other

1465
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,839
system that they hit that one did it

1466
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,880
turned out to this big thing they're

1467
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,800
like oh yeah we don't want that there's

1468
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,559
been stories of people who got

1469
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,559
ransomware the payment made

1470
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,760
and the

1471
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,839
ransomware person returned the money

1472
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,160
because they're like wait uh

1473
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,839
this became a bigger deal than it was

1474
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,400
and my opsec isn't in place and the

1475
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,319
moment i take that money out of bitcoin

1476
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,640
they will know who i am who

1477
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,559
they'll know who i am yeah

1478
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,800
so

1479
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,960
yeah

1480
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,880
take that for what it is there's more on

1481
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,480
the tinfoil hat i'm happy to chat in the

1482
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,000
hall about it we can go into crazy

1483
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,599
depths on that

1484
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,000
with that that pretty much wraps up my

1485
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
ransomware update talk any questions

1486
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,279
from anybody yes sir

1487
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,040
so the question was uh

1488
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
call your pipeline i think it was an

1489
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,559
accident is there any evidence that

1490
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,119
people land in systems and they decide

1491
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,119
not to ransom wear it

1492
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,520
i would say there probably absolutely is

1493
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,640
i would also say if you want to take

1494
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,359
that a little conspiracy crazy further

1495
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,559
is

1496
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,960
if i'm a big apt group or a big

1497
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,760
government and i get into something

1498
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,000
and i want to cover my tracks and it's

1499
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,520
not something super big or critical

1500
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,440
maybe it's just intellectual property or

1501
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
some whatever i'd probably ransomware

1502
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,280
them

1503
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,240
because then they're not going to be

1504
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,119
looking at a big apt group

1505
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,960
you want to cover your tracks ransomware

1506
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,559
everything in there

1507
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,760
make it make it hard to make the

1508
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,440
payments make it hard to recover make it

1509
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,520
like it doesn't matter if they can just

1510
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,359
back up and restore but that's what i

1511
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,800
would do right it's the same as like

1512
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,920
when you're going to now service

1513
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,800
somebody but you're really going to

1514
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,319
attack them over here

1515
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,400
if i was a big apt group

1516
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,240
and i was going through and it wasn't

1517
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,760
something super sensitive i would

1518
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,960
ransomware

1519
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,319
i don't know if i ever know the direct

1520
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,079
answer to your question of were they in

1521
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,440
a government system they said no i'm not

1522
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,119
going to ransomware this but i would

1523
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,800
argue probably for sure

1524
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,520
but nobody releases that so

1525
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,520
yeah

1526
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680
yep

1527
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,440
so his comment was i just had to repeat

1528
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,680
it so he can hear your comment was

1529
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,200
there are absolutely things in the code

1530
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,800
of ransomware that say if you're in this

1531
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,760
type of system or country or org do not

1532
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,000
detonate execute sinkholes things like

1533
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,880
that

1534
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,640
definitely we've seen a lot of that with

1535
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,040
russia

1536
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,880
most of our ransomware seems to be

1537
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,559
coming from russia for the u.s there's

1538
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,559
some pie charts on it it's huge they

1539
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,559
don't attack russian entities because

1540
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,119
that brings the heat right

1541
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,720
um somebody was arguing the holiday the

1542
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,520
other day uh here at the con

1543
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,800
are there americans that are just

1544
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
attacking russian systems all the time

1545
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,240
and they're over like these americans

1546
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,640
just ransomwaring us and i was like i

1547
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,319
don't know but maybe would you get

1548
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,000
arrested for that

1549
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,520
i think if it was to their advantage

1550
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,640
they would i think it's the same in

1551
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,400
russia there's russians get arrested for

1552
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,359
it

1553
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,119
maybe maybe not but the moment that the

1554
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,559
government needs them for some i'm sure

1555
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,559
they're flipping them for some yeah this

1556
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,559
woman

1557
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,440
the question was does insurance cover

1558
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,280
ransomware payouts

1559
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,359
most the time depends on what you do

1560
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,359
that's the reason it keeps going up

1561
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,760
uh what it is turning into is the uh i

1562
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,480
just recently did one a an insurance

1563
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,040
application i remember doing the initial

1564
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,240
uh cyber

1565
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,079
insurance was like one page they're

1566
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,960
turning into full like pci audits

1567
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,559
of what's needed because they're saying

1568
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,160
hey

1569
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,680
yeah you might have a house but you

1570
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,760
didn't put a roof on it i'm not insuring

1571
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,520
all your stuff you don't put a roof on

1572
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,839
that house i am a little worried it's

1573
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,680
going to turn into an approved list of

1574
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,200
vendors that we're all allowed to use

1575
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,839
before the price shoots up

1576
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,520
that's i think we're headed there in the

1577
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,319
future hey if you don't use this vendor

1578
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,800
and these tools that we've approved your

1579
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,599
price has shot up

1580
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,400
yeah so the question was if i'm in a

1581
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
government entity and you're saying that

1582
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,559
brings the heat so therefore we don't

1583
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,640
need to do any of these things uh my

1584
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,240
argument be like somebody's gonna be in

1585
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,319
that system you're just saying instead

1586
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,680
of the impact being skulls and

1587
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,760
crossbones the impact is whatever they

1588
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,800
want

1589
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,119
so if nothing sensitive in there

1590
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,800
then i would argue they're probably

1591
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,760
right

1592
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,040
if you're literally your entire

1593
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,359
sensitivity is all like guest wi-fi

1594
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,400
okay but

1595
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,240
but all orgs have something sensitive

1596
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,359
and if you have something sensitive in

1597
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,880
there somebody's in that system and i

1598
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,480
would want to know

1599
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,640
and if we don't want to know

1600
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,160
then

1601
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,839
i don't know if you don't want to know

1602
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,599
then you're just saying it's all as

1603
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,800
valuable as guest wifi

1604
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
so the question was if they have certain

1605
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,440
sinkholes or kill switches in it um have

1606
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,640
people implemented systems that uh would

1607
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,640
would flag on those like a russian

1608
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,480
keyboard and maybe it not detonate i

1609
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,000
haven't heard of that one particular but

1610
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,880
i mean

1611
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,680
the the wannacry was that to some extent

1612
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,839
started out in the the uk and europe and

1613
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:34,880
all over there started wrecking

1614
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,640
everywhere else through its worm

1615
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,079
and then

1616
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,000
marcus

1617
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,240
what's his handle malware tech byte

1618
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,160
something like that he

1619
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,680
just saw the network call out to this

1620
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,800
domain registered it created a sinkhole

1621
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,720
so there are actively teams working on

1622
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,160
the bigger the incident the more people

1623
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,319
will get involved and work on it

1624
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,400
there are some really cool detections of

1625
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,280
like hey if somebody used vnc or some

1626
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,359
other rdp into my system and the

1627
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,359
keyboard came back as russia to

1628
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,559
immediately get an alert on it there's

1629
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,839
i've heard of things like that but i

1630
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,520
haven't necessarily heard of that maybe

1631
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,880
that does exist and it's being kept

1632
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,760
quiet but that's i don't know i don't

1633
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,119
know the answer

1634
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,160
if you find something like that let me

1635
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,200
know it'd be cool any other questions

1636
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,200
yeah

1637
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,319
i i think you absolutely it's definitely

1638
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,160
dr right so the question was how

1639
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,760
important is backups as backups now

1640
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,599
owned by security and i would say it

1641
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,960
depends on the org

1642
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,400
some morgues have entire dedicated

1643
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,480
people to just dr

1644
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,559
that's it most orgs don't have that

1645
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,040
luxury of having disaster recovery teams

1646
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,880
so that gets shared i would absolutely

1647
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,960
want a security person to to

1648
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,520
review it and maybe sit in on the actual

1649
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,640
testing hopefully you're testing

1650
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,319
annually to make sure those backups

1651
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,040
really do exist when you need them and

1652
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,960
if it was overwritten

1653
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,599
can you still restore it or is your over

1654
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,240
written also encrypted because the last

1655
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,599
thing you want to do is in an incident

1656
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,000
i'm going to go restore from my backups

1657
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,559
and they're also encrypted

1658
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,079
that helps nobody right so test uh it is

1659
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,440
probably owned if you have somebody who

1660
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,559
has their job to own it it's probably

1661
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,680
owned by them

1662
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,119
but i would want a security person to

1663
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,680
like validate it and is it meet whatever

1664
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,359

1665
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,559

1666
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,119
to go back etc

1667
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,359

1668
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,799
