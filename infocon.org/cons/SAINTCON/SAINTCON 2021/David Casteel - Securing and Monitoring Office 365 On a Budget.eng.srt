1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,599
i'm guessing that a lot of people can

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,240
relate to especially smaller businesses

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,000
like the one i work for

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
not getting a lot of budget

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
so

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,719
kind of like you can do your thing just

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,440
don't come and ask us for money so

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,839
that's kind of a i it's not quite that

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,520
bad but definitely uh start talking e5

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,760
uh microsoft license double and triple

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
what we're paying now

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
not super excited to just start paying

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,800
for that so

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
that's kind of where i had to figure out

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,519
how to

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,479
do the best i could kind of like

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
how pope talked about in the keynote

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
like just do what you can anything's

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,760
better than nothing just make little

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
baby steps

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
i think a lot of us can get over

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,320
overwhelmed

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,760
when you look at all the stuff that you

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
can do should be doing want to do

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,840
a little bit of the time

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
little baby bites rather than one big

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
gulp

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
okay

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
anybody that's used microsoft office 365

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,079
uh

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,840
all the programs involved in sharepoint

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,360
onedrive and just even just exchange

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
it's huge it's changing all the time

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,760
um

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
you just like i said you just have to do

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,400
it a little bit at a time that i think

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
they did a great job with the tools that

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,520
they give you

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
to

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
allow you to take little little bites of

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
this and track your progress like i said

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,240
we'll get into some of the tools that

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
they show you they have they've got some

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
great

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
visual guides that you can actually send

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
to your executives and or your boss or

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
whoever whoever you're reporting to to

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
show them hey i'm making progress i'm

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
i'm you know today yesterday today is

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
better than yesterday and and so forth

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
and so forth and that's that's really

52
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
what a lot of bosses want to see from

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
what i've at least been my experience

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
so

55
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,799
project management software if you're

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
not using it even for yourself or some

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
kind of task list helps a lot

58
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
i know myself i forget stuff i'm sitting

59
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,759
at home even though i try not to work at

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,640
home

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,719
as well but i'll be sitting at home and

62
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
like oh i need to do that and if i don't

63
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,079
write it down

64
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
it's not going to happen i'll i'll

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,439
remember it again in a week

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
and and then then i'll realize that i

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
need to do it again and the cycle will

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
happen all over again

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
so

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,400
use task list use a project manager it

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
it's bosses love to see that stuff

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
especially if they're copied on it they

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
can see that you're taking stuff off of

74
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,480
your list and you're actually working so

75
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
um

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
same thing with office 365

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
in the last couple years they just

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
they're moving stuff around constantly i

79
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,519
still have to google stuff even when i

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
was writing these slides up i'd set this

81
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
stuff up and i still can remember and

82
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,239
they'd move stuff around i had to google

83
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,480
how do you do this and because there's

84
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
and a lot of times you have the the new

85
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
ad exchange admin console or the old one

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
and

87
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
my policy or my philosophy on that is

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
they're gonna give me a chance to use

89
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
the new one i'm guessing at some point

90
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,319
they're going to force me to use that

91
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,120
one

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
so i might as well just use it now i can

93
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
get it over with might as well just

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
learn how to use it because this is

95
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,599
probably the future and i've tried i've

96
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
tried to explain that to users uh

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
especially with the mac version of

98
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
outlook there's a little button anybody

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,159
uses a mac without look there's a little

100
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
button use the new outlook

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
i just tell them like there's going to

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,440
come a time where an update is going to

103
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
get pushed and you're not going to be

104
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
able to turn that off so

105
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
it's either it's have pain now or have

106
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
pain later so pick your choice

107
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,200
um this is just an overview of the the

108
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,560
of the stuff that we're going to go over

109
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
like i said this is not a this is not a

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,000
comprehensive look this is not an expert

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
look as you can tell by the title of it

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
this is just the beginning steps the the

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
basic stuff that you can do

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
with this i think that got to change the

115
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
name of the licensing i think it's like

116
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
business

117
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
it used to be business premium

118
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
so and i think they're just trying to

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
get it across so that's just the normal

120
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
license now it's like office 365

121
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
business or something like that it's

122
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
basically just the main office exchange

123
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,920
license

124
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
along with the apps basically i'm

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
guessing a lot of people have

126
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,360
and then you get into the e1 e3 e5 and

127
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,439
there's like i don't know a dozen add-on

128
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,319
licenses or more for azure id all kinds

129
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,439
of different stuff to give you extra

130
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,080
options extra security controls

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
but like i said all those cost money per

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
user per month

133
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,600
and even if you've got 50 or 100 users

134
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,759
that's not 20 a month it starts adding

135
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
up to hundreds of dollars a month just

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
for one control and and to justify

137
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
that's difficult sometimes

138
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
when you've got tight budgets so

139
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
at the top of course

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
multi-factor

141
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
go take a look at any of your users

142
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
failed logins i'd almost guarantee

143
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
you're going to see

144
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
logins from all over the world um if you

145
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
have any

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
um

147
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
any uh

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
visibility to your business

149
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
at all on the internet and your emails

150
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,479
are out there you're gonna have failed

151
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,440
logins

152
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,280
um this is one of the things that i use

153
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
to justify forcing everybody to get to

154
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
mfa

155
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
and it's one of the best

156
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
best tools there's obviously different

157
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
flavors of mfa that they that microsoft

158
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
allows you to use now including up to

159
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
502 which is awesome uh

160
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,000
i'm guessing you're probably not going

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
to get most users to carry around

162
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
security keys so

163
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,600
global admin is great

164
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
like i talked about the compliance

165
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,479
manager

166
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,840
they give a lot of great

167
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
uh

168
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
tasks and steps as well as a score you

169
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
get overall score you get to they also i

170
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,639
think they used to compare it to other

171
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
business sizes like other license sides

172
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
so you can kind of see where you're at

173
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,039
above average below average

174
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,560
audit logs you used to have to turn

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
those on

176
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
for the most part they're on by default

177
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
now but i'd still double check

178
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,039
um data retention

179
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
uh it protects you from some ransomware

180
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,560
or

181
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
a user deleting files out of sharepoint

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
or onedrive anything like that

183
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
as you all know we oftentimes have to

184
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
protect users from themselves

185
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
so that's a great a great tool to have

186
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
in a lot of alerts i think i should

187
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
probably it's not really an order i

188
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
think alerts is probably higher up on

189
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
this list

190
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,600
it's what allowed me to catch a couple

191
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
different breaches is getting alerts

192
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
when certain things are set into place

193
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
when certain features are turned on in

194
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
office 365

195
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
anytime a

196
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
mail search is run on an archive that

197
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
you have to you search for i've had to

198
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
do some searches for attorneys anytime

199
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
those are run i get an alert even though

200
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
it's usually me running it it's nice to

201
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
know that you're when those are

202
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
happening

203
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
backup global admin

204
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
uh along with using uh

205
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
not using your user

206
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
as the admin that you're logged into all

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
the time should always have a backup if

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
especially if you're especially if

209
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,720
you're using security keys

210
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
have have backup access you get locked

211
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,840
out of that admin

212
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
and i guess i've never had to look into

213
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
it but i'm going to guess it's probably

214
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
not a very fun process to get back

215
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
into that admin through microsoft

216
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
mail rules uh it's going to allow you to

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
block things before they even get to

218
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,639
your users

219
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,400
like i said this is

220
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
a lot of this stuff we know phishing

221
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
works you spearfish your users is going

222
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
to work like we already know this so the

223
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
point is to stop that stuff from getting

224
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,280
to your users

225
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,520
um

226
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,680
spf dkm dmarc all email signing

227
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
for the most part pretty easy to set up

228
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
this is going to have a big benefit to

229
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
you getting your emails out to your

230
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,080
customers

231
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
depending on the size of customers the

232
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
size of people that you're sending

233
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
emails to

234
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
your stuff could be good and put in spam

235
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
and junk filters because it's not signed

236
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,599
properly

237
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
um as well as it stops

238
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
uh

239
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
people from spoofing your your your

240
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,639
domain so it's it's a really big

241
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,840
important

242
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,919
last one thread explorer

243
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
this is where you're going to do some

244
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
threat hunting

245
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
you can go through

246
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
emails that your users have reported

247
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
emails that that

248
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
microsoft has flagged

249
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,840
as far as

250
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,599
either viruses or spam or phishing

251
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,919
attempts anything like that

252
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
it's a it's a great tool to find out

253
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,639
who in your

254
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,080
organization is getting targeted the

255
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
most

256
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
especially if you're rolling out mfa

257
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
those are the users

258
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
that you want to start with because

259
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,759
those are the users that are getting hit

260
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
the hardest and it's usually the users

261
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,960
that have been there the longest

262
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
most of my team that have either getting

263
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
hit the hardest have been there since

264
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
the company was founded 20 years ago

265
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
they're usually executives so their

266
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
email is kind of out there a lot more

267
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,639
often so they're communicating with a

268
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
lot more people and obviously they have

269
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
access to more stuff then they're

270
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
getting financial reports stuff like

271
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,399
that so that's that's definitely the

272
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,839
the priority

273
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,080
prioritization okay

274
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
one of the things in the compliance

275
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
score is getting mfa set up for all

276
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
users um you get points i believe you

277
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
get points for every user

278
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,279
as far as that goes and it kind of upset

279
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,080
score and

280
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,640
even if you just get them set up on sms

281
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
it's better than nothing um it gets them

282
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,959
started down that road of just realizing

283
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
that this is the way things are now like

284
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
you don't just get a log into a new

285
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,279
computer

286
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
without having to use you know

287
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,120
multi-factor authentication

288
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
um i always explain to users too most of

289
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
mine are most of my users are on one

290
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,680
laptop and for a year or two at least

291
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
for the most part if they don't have

292
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
problems

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
if as long as they're not logged into

294
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
another computer another device and

295
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
getting a new phone

296
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,600
they probably won't even have to deal

297
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
with this it's easy to turn off and

298
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
reset for your users so if they get a

299
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,320
new phone number or anything like that

300
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
they wipe their phone and they have the

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
authenticator app that's the only thing

302
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
they have you can shut it off and turn

303
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
it back on and reset that mfa

304
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
i love the microsoft authenticator app

305
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
um

306
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
because it doesn't require an input into

307
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,760
the

308
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
you don't have to copy a code

309
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
it doesn't seem like that big of a deal

310
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
for us users hate that it's it's a

311
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,519
burden to them

312
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
um so being able to use your watch or

313
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,959
your phone and just tap approve

314
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,120
it makes it easier and it's still fairly

315
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,360
secure compared to you know obviously

316
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
compared to not having mfa

317
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
azure ad just recently i don't know over

318
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
half a few months ago i remember exact

319
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,120
date started using fido 2. um

320
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
if you haven't used 502 it's

321
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
it's supposedly unfishable because of

322
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
the security exchange of the keys

323
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
basically

324
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,200
don't just have one key

325
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
have a backup key and have a backup to

326
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,079
your backup key

327
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,279
especially if you're going to do it

328
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,800
properly and shut all other

329
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
authentication methods off besides that

330
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,399
fido key

331
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
um i we we have one uh we're going to

332
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
put this i actually got just ordered a

333
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
bunch of fido keys to set this up on

334
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,079
ours because of what i found out with

335
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
that they finally forced support 502.

336
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,279
there's a lot of other manufacturers

337
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,800
that are getting on bitwarden actually

338
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,399
just started just turn on

339
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
502 as well uh rather than just doing

340
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
the like the before they just had i had

341
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,120
a yubikey and they just had an otp you

342
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
hit the key and just paste the code in

343
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,920
there which is not nearly as secure as

344
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
502. that could be fished that can you

345
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
can click on the wrong link and you can

346
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,880
put that into a a spoofed website

347
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
i've tried to

348
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
put the

349
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
the link to the microsoft documents

350
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
because they change stuff all the time

351
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
they always update theirs on how you set

352
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
stuff up on the options they have

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,279
obviously they didn't have 502 before

354
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,320
and they're and they're updating their

355
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
documentation their documentation is

356
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
usually pretty easy to find and it's uh

357
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
fairly well written obviously for a big

358
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
as big as they are um

359
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,839
i already talked about only required to

360
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,600
log into new device

361
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,399
um

362
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,480
i think just walking through users and

363
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
like i said how very little impact this

364
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
will have as long as for in ninety

365
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,839
percent of the cases

366
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,640
it is a lot of my users

367
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
worries about setting this up

368
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
here's what you see

369
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
when you sign in with two factor on

370
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
you can set the priority in in their

371
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,079
authentication you can have multiple you

372
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,000
can have sms it usually wants you to set

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
a backup sms on there so even if you set

374
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
up a new account and you don't want sms

375
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
on there as far as i know it forces you

376
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
to put it on there you have to go back

377
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
in later and delete it out of there

378
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
and then set the order whatever is at

379
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
the top is what it immediately prompts

380
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
you for to first so i usually try to set

381
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,839
my users with authenticator app first if

382
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,000
if they're able and willing to um and

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
like i said here's here's an example you

384
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
just literally just tap approve there's

385
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
no copying codes there's no waiting for

386
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
a code to time out like a normal you

387
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
know otp code

388
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,880
okay

389
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
kind of talked about this a little bit

390
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
preaching the choir here a little bit

391
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
security keys i'm guessing a lot of

392
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
people

393
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,399
have

394
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,000
at least heard of them if they are using

395
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
them

396
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
there's lots of brands out there i did

397
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
some searches on amazon and like it just

398
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,320
seems like there's more and more

399
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
companies even making these

400
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,079
yubikey is obviously the big big one

401
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
google google's been making their titans

402
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
for a while too

403
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
i even talked to

404
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
i remember who it was the other day i

405
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,360
think it was somebody in the speaker's

406
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
lounge that hadn't heard of fishing i've

407
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,839
used their keys for a little while

408
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
they're not as feature rich as yuba key

409
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,079
as far as i can tell what you're paying

410
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,920
for the yubikey a lot of that is the

411
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
software support uh for the longest time

412
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
they had a a special software made for

413
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
windows to use for uh passwordless

414
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,360
logins like and it only worked in the

415
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,639
yuba keys

416
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,320
as we're moving over to more standards

417
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
like 502

418
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
it's less and less likely

419
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,920
i'm not sure if uh i can't have didn't

420
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,399
check if fishing offers keys with the

421
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,120
fips for the federal government standard

422
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
but if you're going to buy a yubikey i

423
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
think we i've heard in other talks

424
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
people talking like there's no reason

425
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
really as far as i can tell unless

426
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,680
you're unless you're buying a thousand

427
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
keys and you're really on a budget not

428
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
to buy the the fips just in case like

429
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
and then you got it and you have it you

430
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
know and just in case you might you

431
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
never know when you're going to need it

432
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
in the future i think they're like a 10

433
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
difference 15 difference

434
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,639
60 versus 70 kind of thing for the fips

435
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
versus the just the regular 502 nfc

436
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,560
if you are in a budget um i just ordered

437
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
a bunch of the the fishing keys i think

438
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,920
with fido 2 and nfc they're like 22 23

439
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
bucks so i think as far as i remember

440
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
the the main usb the main usb a yubikey

441
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
is like 50 or 60. so if you're buying a

442
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,279
bunch of those

443
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
that's a big difference that adds up

444
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,959
fish and even i don't know if yubikey

445
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
does this but i know fishing actually on

446
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,760
their website advertises custom laser

447
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
engraving too

448
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
i'm not sure it'd be a great idea to get

449
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
your company name on them

450
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
it's for security reasons somebody loses

451
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,399
it that's the last thing you need

452
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
but you might be able to have some mark

453
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
on there that that obviously you guys

454
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,199
know

455
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
that's your company key kind of thing

456
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
um

457
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
let's see here okay

458
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
oh this is just a list of the yubikeys

459
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
um

460
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
as you can see you yubiko has has a key

461
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
that just supports uh

462
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
the fido two basically

463
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
when you pay the extra money you get nfc

464
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
and they even have the bio keys uh

465
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
fusion's had it for a while in a bigger

466
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
uh like bluetooth kind of thing

467
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
but yubico and fishing have both kind of

468
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,920
micro miniaturized theirs into the usba

469
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,760
kind of keychain mode too i have not get

470
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
to use one of those that's my list to

471
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
get one to to try it out

472
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
um

473
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,079
here's here's a list just a

474
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
portion of fusion keys they have ones

475
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,480
you can that that for usb c and a that

476
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,839
you can even leave in your in your

477
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,839
computer depending on your use case

478
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
that's that's really convenient i have

479
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
one on my in my house and my desktop at

480
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
home is kind of my backup key

481
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,959
uh that i leave in there so

482
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
i figure if somebody's in my house like

483
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
that's the least of my problems at that

484
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
point is them having access to my

485
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
security key

486
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,440
compliance manager it used to be called

487
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
a

488
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,519
security score or something like that

489
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,959
they've kind of

490
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,560
encompassed it another

491
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
with other tools and kind of kind of put

492
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
them all together a little bit

493
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
it allows you to do hipaa compliance uh

494
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,160
pci dss compliance all kinds basically

495
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
anything you'd have any security

496
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,399
framework that you have to comply to

497
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,079
they have controls in there so that you

498
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,519
can turn on and figure out like hey this

499
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,519
is what hipaa requires this is what pci

500
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,440
dss requires and you don't have this

501
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,600
this and this turned on

502
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
i love the gamification of it you can

503
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
see real time

504
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
you know your your progress um like i

505
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
talked about earlier take baby steps and

506
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,320
you can see you know even for yourself

507
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,759
even if even if your boss doesn't care

508
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,160
record it for yourself for yourself

509
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
and show that uh that you can see you're

510
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
making progress you're making your your

511
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
uh

512
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
organization more secure

513
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
and like i said a lot of us have

514
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,240
non-technical managers and bosses

515
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,279
they know that 650 is higher than 600

516
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,959
like that's they don't they don't need

517
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
to know exactly what you got to do to

518
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
get to that 650 and i'm guessing most

519
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
don't really care

520
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
um because they don't want to know about

521
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,279
that stuff they have other things to

522
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,839
deal with

523
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,119
so this

524
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
this program this module is huge there's

525
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,439
tons of stuff on you could probably do a

526
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,959
talk just on this

527
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,799
for two hours easily there's just so

528
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,480
much stuff on there depending on

529
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
what compliance you have to meet with

530
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,280
like i said with hipaa and and uh iso

531
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
2701 all that kind of stuff there

532
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,799
there's just tons of information in

533
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
there there's hundreds of of tasks that

534
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,720
you can do

535
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,520
to

536
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
make your or your

537
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
make your org more secure the only thing

538
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
i i can't remember if it used to do this

539
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
it's been a while since i've seen it in

540
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
there um the only thing that i wish they

541
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
would do and i obviously money is why

542
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
they don't is be able to sort things by

543
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
the license that you have what can i do

544
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
with the licenses that i have without

545
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
getting extra money so what i got

546
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
frustrated with a little bit is like

547
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
going in it's like hey you need to do

548
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
this and this is a high risk you need to

549
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
turn this on like that's awesome i'm

550
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
gonna go turn this on and go

551
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
yeah you need azure premium ad licenses

552
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,120
do this and it's six bucks a user per

553
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
month i'm like yeah that's not going to

554
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
happen so

555
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
that's the downside to that that i can

556
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
see that i've had here's a look at it uh

557
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,799
today like i said it's changed a lot

558
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,160
they kind of put that compliance score

559
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,000
front and center

560
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
and give you a little gauge and

561
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,720
everything like that

562
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
uh depending i think you can you can

563
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
even customize this layout a little bit

564
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
depending on on what your what your your

565
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
goals are

566
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
what you're working on they usually they

567
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
give you give you a

568
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
high level look of the most important

569
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,600
tasks to turn on

570
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
i'm a big fan of this tool it helps help

571
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
me a lot it's because i end up catching

572
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
a breach because of recommendations that

573
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
they have let me turn on

574
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
i'm not really sure why some of those

575
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
weren't turned on by default more of

576
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
them are getting turned on by default it

577
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
seems

578
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
like the auditing and stuff like that

579
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,280
and the logs

580
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
not really sure why you wouldn't want

581
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
logs turned on automatically even if you

582
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
didn't use them

583
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
but they've apparently taken that

584
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
that that advice

585
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
auto logs

586
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
double check like i said

587
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
most new depending on how long you've

588
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
had your tenant i don't know if they

589
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
actually flipped it on for all tenants

590
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
or just new created my guesses

591
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
uh just new created tenants so if you

592
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
have an older tenant you've had it for a

593
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
few years or longer you probably and you

594
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,280
haven't turned these on you probably

595
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,559
need to turn them on

596
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,960
you this there's there's every every

597
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
product has five six seven different

598
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
things that you can search for by by all

599
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,360
users while you need security groups you

600
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
have set up failed logins anything

601
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,039
anytime a mailbox

602
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,880
item has been deleted there's it gets

603
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
very granular in there

604
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
the downside is is that if you want logs

605
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
for more than 90 days you get to pay for

606
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
it

607
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,799
so

608
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
90 days in our world a lot of times it's

609
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
not that long of a time

610
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
i haven't looked into it that much

611
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,960
just doing some research for this talk i

612
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
found out that

613
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,039
at least at the time there is some

614
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,520
powershell commands that you can access

615
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
logs for up to a year past that 90 days

616
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,080
but the web gui all you get is 90 days

617
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
and i've i've also found that web gui to

618
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
be a little bit buggy sometimes i will

619
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
search for

620
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
logs for a basically a previous week for

621
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
a user for something really basic that a

622
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
user does all the time even on my own

623
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,760
user and it says nothing it'll say

624
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
no logs found and i was

625
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
okay there should be logs for that so

626
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,039
keep that in mind i haven't used

627
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,360
powershell that much as far as this goes

628
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
so but my guess is like many things that

629
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
access the powershell it's probably more

630
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
reliable than that web gui probably a

631
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
lot faster too

632
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
uh data retention

633
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
uh obviously if you use onedrive and

634
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
you're storing or sharepoint and you're

635
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
storing critical information in there

636
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
uh we all know that it's possible to

637
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
have a disgruntled user purposely delete

638
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
something or even accidentally delete

639
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
something

640
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
so

641
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,360
i'm guessing after talking to a lot of

642
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
people there's a lot of people here that

643
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
work for governmental organizations and

644
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
schools and stuff like that

645
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
as far as i know

646
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
grandma here in utah and i'm guessing a

647
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
lot of others are fairly similar

648
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
requires organizations to keep data for

649
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
at least seven years

650
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,520
um

651
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,559
so that's one thing obviously

652
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
we need to pay pay attention to you

653
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
don't want users deleting stuff

654
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
and somebody in five years requesting a

655
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
grammar request for it and you saying

656
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
oops sorry i don't have it

657
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
uh that probably is not going to go over

658
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,919
very well

659
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
um

660
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,880
obviously this stuff's changing all the

661
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,159
time

662
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,600
when i went in there to look at this

663
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
since i'd set it up the interface looked

664
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
completely different so i had to even

665
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
kind of learn it all over again

666
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,159
this can bite you in the butt

667
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,240
um i had ours turn i think it maybe even

668
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,520
came defaulted to seven years i don't

669
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,799
know why i had it on there we don't have

670
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,200
any requirements like that

671
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
i had a user that was trying to move a

672
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
lot of data in and out of their onedrive

673
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,000
i don't know if they just didn't need it

674
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
and they were using it temporarily and

675
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
it held about 90 percent of their their

676
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,440
box at about you know eight or nine

677
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
hundred gigs

678
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
and i couldn't find even turning it off

679
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
even i even completely turned the data

680
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,320
retention off

681
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
and it wouldn't release it and it takes

682
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,400
time like it says it can even take up to

683
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
24 hours to make that change

684
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
and even then it's i still couldn't find

685
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
an easy way to delete that that data

686
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
retention hold in there so

687
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
i'm hoping that eventually it will just

688
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
go away i just and i had a lot of extra

689
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
space so i just gave the user extra

690
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
extra one drive space since a lot of the

691
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,039
users that are in my org don't don't use

692
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
it so

693
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,679
but you have to be careful with that

694
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
if you use sharepoint obviously email is

695
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
probably the big one especially for a

696
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
governmental organization

697
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
as far as i'm aware most times when a

698
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,799
grammar request is made especially news

699
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,559
organizations or anything like that it's

700
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
usually for email

701
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,400
but a lot of times they will make

702
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
requests for i want any

703
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
communication on this topic and in these

704
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
dates and so

705
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,640
the controls in microsoft make it really

706
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,080
easy to search for that stuff you just

707
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,159
kind of check boxes basically you type

708
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,840
in a keyword and search and it'll pull

709
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
one drive it'll pull sharepoint any file

710
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
that has that keyword match it'll pull

711
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,400
those

712
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
so it does make it pretty easy when i

713
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,720
i've had to pull uh uh keyword searches

714
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
on emails for lawsuits and it's it's

715
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
actually really simple even though it

716
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
forces you or at least the time it

717
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
forced me to use

718
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,240
i don't even know if it maybe it wasn't

719
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
even edge i think i had it forced me to

720
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,159
use internet explorer to use this little

721
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,600
tool to download the file so that was

722
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
kind of a pain in the butt but

723
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
overall not too bad

724
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,799
okay i already covered this

725
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,158
uh yep

726
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
alerts i think this behind mfa this is

727
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
probably the most important uh like i

728
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,559
said this is how i caught a breach of a

729
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,880
user i have any time a forward gets

730
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,080
turned on an email i get an email saying

731
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
that this user set up forwarding to

732
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
their email

733
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
i've in

734
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,440
my previous job as it consultant

735
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,279
i had a few clients

736
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,440
i had a real estate client that had a

737
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,760
email forward on their g suite set up

738
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
and for an under undetermined amount of

739
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,200
time it could have been a month it could

740
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
have been six months it could have been

741
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
two years they don't have any clue and

742
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
it was on one of the finance managers so

743
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
any financial transaction to this

744
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
realtor went through this person's email

745
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,559
and

746
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
this is actually end up tracking that

747
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,240
down because the customer had a

748
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,159
uh got a phishing email

749
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,840
that i that that my client wanted me to

750
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,080
go check out i went into it thinking

751
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
probably just a generic phishing email

752
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
they just happened to be buying a house

753
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,799
and they got a phishing email about a

754
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,120
financial transaction that this this

755
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,559
malicious actor sprayed out to a bunch

756
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,600
of people and they happened to catch

757
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
somebody in there

758
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
i get out to this customer's house i

759
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
take a look at her laptop and i pull up

760
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
the email and i'm looking at and in the

761
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
subject line there's an address to a

762
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
house and i asked the

763
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
the woman that that was the client and i

764
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
said hey what's the address of the house

765
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,559
you're buying and she rattles it off and

766
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
it matches the address in the in the

767
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
subject line and i was like wow okay

768
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
that's probably

769
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
probably not really generic i think this

770
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
person actually knew this person was

771
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
buying this house and they were

772
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
i don't know how expensive the house was

773
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,640
it was a high-end real estate agent so

774
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,840
it could have been hundreds of thousands

775
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
of dollars that they just about wired to

776
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,480
the wrong person

777
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
uh because this person this malicious

778
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
actor

779
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
knew that they were buying this house

780
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
sent them an email and told them hey we

781
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,440
just need to change the wire

782
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
instructions for this we just need to

783
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,919
send it to this one instead of something

784
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
like just an update

785
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,480
and thankfully uh all involved thought

786
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,919
something was weird

787
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,799
and

788
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,159
called me in and that's when we end up

789
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
tracking down an email forward or set up

790
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
on one of their email email accounts and

791
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,320
we found a couple others as well

792
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,679
but like i said since i had this alert

793
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
set up uh within minutes i knew that

794
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,679
this forwarder had some been set up on

795
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,360
this person this user's account i called

796
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,159
them

797
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,840
uh asked them if they set up forwarder

798
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,240
they obviously didn't i locked their pa

799
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,159
i signed them out of all accounts change

800
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,520
their password

801
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
and logged into it and found out that

802
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
keywords were set up for i think it said

803
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,279
like invoices and some other financial

804
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
documents kind of thing like that so

805
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,720
this this actor was looking for just to

806
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
forward financial documents

807
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
this is a big help

808
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
um obviously if you want to spend some

809
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,880
money you got some e5 licenses laying

810
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,760
around

811
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,600
you get a lot more tools for microsoft

812
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
you get some behavioral analytics that

813
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
they have built in where you're looking

814
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,320
at different behaviors and different

815
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,559
behavior patterns and not just if this

816
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,360
then that happens uh you get a lot more

817
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,200
you get a lot more power and exactly

818
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
what

819
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
what you're what you're hunting for

820
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
so

821
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
okay

822
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
um

823
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,679
i'm gonna admit

824
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,360
i was using my

825
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
uh

826
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
my user as a global admin as of a couple

827
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
weeks ago

828
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
and i had somebody review this this

829
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
slideshow and this actually slide was

830
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
not actually about

831
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
not using your admin your your user

832
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,440
credentials as a global admin uh it was

833
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
more about having a backup just in case

834
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
you lost access or

835
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
you got hit by a truck tomorrow and the

836
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,679
company could still get into your

837
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,640
account

838
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
uh so that's that's something we all

839
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,880
should be planning for is if you quit

840
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
and they forget to get stuff from you or

841
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,320
like i said you you get sick and you're

842
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,880
in the hospital or whatever bad thing

843
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
you can think you could happen to you we

844
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
should all be planning we don't want

845
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
that business you know going under just

846
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,480
because of an accident um

847
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
but this person like i said this uh

848
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
gentleman that reviewed my slideshow

849
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
is like great that's awesome yeah we

850
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
definitely shouldn't be using our main

851
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
user as global admin

852
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
and i was like yeah i'm not doing that i

853
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,159
promise so i changed it over i have i

854
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,480
have have a separate global admin it's

855
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
not my email address anymore uh and i've

856
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,399
got a backup i've had a backup for a

857
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,360
while

858
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
um

859
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
we're gonna have uh security keys i

860
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,880
think i ordered three or four of them

861
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,159
that's set up on the account and i'm

862
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
going to inform my boss and his boss

863
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
like what they're for have them put in

864
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
either i don't know if they have a safe

865
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
or just a just a filing cabinet or

866
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,760
something to put them away so that if

867
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
mine gets lost mine gets broken we don't

868
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,799
lose access to that

869
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,760
obviously if you're at home i recommend

870
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
doing the same thing at least at the

871
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,240
very least off site

872
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
most fire safes

873
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
are rate if you have to look in your

874
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,399
fire safe i think some of them might

875
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,520
have it

876
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
if you have thumb drives or hard drives

877
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,360
in there most fire safes are rated to

878
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,679
that fire limit for for ignition of

879
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,320
papers or ignition of objects that

880
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
doesn't mean electronics are going to

881
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,480
survive

882
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,360
so keep that in mind

883
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,159
okay perfect

884
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
let's see here

885
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,279
mail rules

886
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
okay

887
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
mail rules

888
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,799
how many think it's a great idea to have

889
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,399
executable files getting sent to your

890
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,760
users

891
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
this is how you stop it um

892
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
again a lot of this stuff comes down to

893
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
protecting users from themselves if they

894
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,399
never see it they never get it they

895
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,880
can't click on it and they can't open it

896
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
i had a user open a

897
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,559
password-protected zip file from a hotel

898
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,240
that they were going to be staying at

899
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
and because they needed the information

900
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,440
in there and they didn't think anything

901
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
of typing that password and opening that

902
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
and enabling macros on

903
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
a microsoft word file so and that was

904
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,320
soon after that that i said that i

905
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,799
figured out that you can actually block

906
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,960
just password and corrupted archive

907
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,440
files or you can block all ici files i

908
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
tried to block all archive files

909
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,200
uh i didn't go over so well uh it turns

910
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,120
out people still send a lot of zip files

911
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
and they get quite upset when you tell

912
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,720
them to use onedrive for dropbox

913
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
for some reason i didn't think it was

914
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
that difficult but apparently it is so

915
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,840
we scaled it back uh to just password

916
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
protected uh because at that point

917
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,919
obviously antivirus uh microsoft's

918
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,000
scanning an av can't look in that file

919
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,919
uh if it's password protected and

920
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,279
obviously that's why they send it pass

921
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,760
protected

922
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
uh

923
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,799
oh

924
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,279
spam emails we were getting i'm sure if

925
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,880
you've had executives out there for long

926
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,320
enough for the company you're going to

927
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
get gmail addresses

928
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,919
with john doe on it as your cfo and

929
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,760
the way unfortunately the way outlook

930
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,840
and a lot of their email clients display

931
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
it they don't display the email address

932
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
they just display the actual to address

933
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,039
that you're typing in here i

934
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,840
no clue why i've i've tried i'm starting

935
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
to train users on how to

936
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,600
look for that if you have to hit reply

937
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,880
and look at the reply address that's

938
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
that's the easiest way do that look at

939
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
the address first but one thing that

940
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,640
i've done to stop a lot of that is at

941
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
least for my executives anything that

942
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
comes from outside the organization that

943
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
has their name on it basically in the to

944
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
field just gets automatically

945
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
quarantined uh it like i said it removes

946
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
that even attempted and we've i've seen

947
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,120
i've got a lot less hey is this is this

948
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,159
fake or not emails since doing that so

949
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,919
it's definitely saved my

950
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,720
my time and my sanity

951
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,279
spf dkm and dmarc all these

952
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
i'm going to admit i'm not an expert in

953
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,399
encryption or signing anything like that

954
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,159
i can read a tutorial and set them up

955
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,919
it's really not that difficult as long

956
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,480
as you have access to dns

957
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
and and can copy and paste for the most

958
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
part you can set these up there

959
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
as you get the spf is obviously the

960
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,320
easiest but

961
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,440
they're they're really not that

962
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,039
difficult and it makes it it goes a long

963
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,080
ways to from users i mean malicious

964
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
actors spoofing your your email and

965
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
sending emails out to your clients and

966
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
trying to get trying to fish them

967
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,919
this just goes through

968
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
setting up spf

969
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
the spf's the easiest because as far as

970
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,159
i know especially for out for office 365

971
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,519
it's all the same

972
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
the same record for everybody there's no

973
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
changing for your domain or anything

974
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
like that you can go into the into the

975
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,279
settings and it'll actually just let you

976
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
copy and paste it anytime you set up a

977
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
new domain it actually tells you to set

978
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
this up anyways

979
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
it won't i don't think it won't stop you

980
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
from setting it up you don't set it if

981
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
you don't put that record in there but

982
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,000
it does walk you through that

983
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,600
i was watching um

984
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
a couple other

985
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,120
uh talks and i realized like i don't

986
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,960
have any funny memes in mind

987
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,519
so i i apologize i will fix that for

988
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,760
next year

989
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,880
uh dkm and dmarc like i said microsoft's

990
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,399
got great documentation walks you

991
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
through exactly how to settle this up

992
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
this stuff and then there's a new

993
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,960
exchange admin console all this stuff's

994
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
all different you can still at the at

995
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,320
the time i wrote this you could still

996
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,880
use the old one and in my opinion it was

997
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
it's almost identical to on-site

998
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,880
exchange so if you've managed on-site

999
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,240
exchange the

1000
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,360
the old

1001
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,919
uh exchange admin console looks pretty

1002
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,600
close to that and this stuff's pretty

1003
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,840
easy to find in there

1004
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
they got to make it newer and prettier

1005
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
so it looks like they're changing stuff

1006
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
the new one's a little more difficult to

1007
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
navigate at least in my opinion because

1008
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,240
i guess i just know how to get through

1009
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
the other one

1010
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
it's not much different than uh than

1011
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,159
setting up spf but there's you have to

1012
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,840
set up a couple records and some of them

1013
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
in there and you have to

1014
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,960
change some stuff in there as far as

1015
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,399
your domain goes and stuff like that

1016
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,039
i would always double check obviously

1017
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,880
um you can check headers after emails

1018
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,240
have been set and it'll show you if it's

1019
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,159
signed properly and there's header

1020
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,080
analyzers out there that will you can

1021
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
just drop the header into and it'll tell

1022
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,159
you hey dmarc set up it's signed

1023
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,600
correctly and it's working

1024
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
obviously i'm hoping that most of us

1025
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
have in here if you're if you're running

1026
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,200
if you're admitting email and stuff like

1027
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
that you've probably used mx toolbox

1028
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,200
check for blacklist there's a whole

1029
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,559
bunch of toolbar tools in there one of

1030
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,799
them is an spf checker and it pretty

1031
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
quickly tells you

1032
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
uh if that's if that records found

1033
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,760
basically

1034
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,799
the other one is going to have to

1035
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,720
authenticate a little differently than

1036
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,279
spf but spf is basically checking is

1037
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,850
there a record there or not

1038
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,679
[Applause]

1039
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,679
so make sure you double check those make

1040
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,960
sure you're verifying that they're set

1041
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
up properly

1042
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
i think in one of the i think one of the

1043
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,320
either dmark or dkim uh when i copied

1044
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
and pasted the the record there was a

1045
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,159
space at the end of the front of it and

1046
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,279
the back of it

1047
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,719
let it go in there and just wouldn't

1048
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,119
work so i went took it out boom went

1049
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,320
right through so

1050
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,679
there's common little mistakes that you

1051
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,040
can make so always double check that

1052
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
that's set up properly

1053
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,399
uh threat management console

1054
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,679
uh

1055
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,839
if you like to threat hunt uh obviously

1056
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,440
this is the the place you're gonna go uh

1057
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,520
any time uh

1058
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,639
you have a lot of emails getting blocked

1059
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,079
it's a lot it's easy to go in here and

1060
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
see exactly what's getting blocked

1061
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,520
anytime i've got some downtime i go in

1062
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,440
here and look i've caught emails that

1063
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,040
have gotten blocked from clients that i

1064
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,520
was able to verify that were legit and

1065
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,119
they were important business you know

1066
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
emails from a client so

1067
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
uh that went to one of our i think one

1068
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,800
of our vps and he would have been kind

1069
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
of upset if he didn't get that email so

1070
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,199
um obviously i would double check with

1071
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,160
them that you let them know hey this was

1072
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
cotton and quarantine

1073
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,040
it looks like it's fine uh

1074
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,560
but be careful with it don't go clicking

1075
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
on any links or anything in it or

1076
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
anything like that so

1077
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,839
there's lots of controls in here for um

1078
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,760
how it's blocking stuff how much it's

1079
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
grabbing of stuff is obviously it's kind

1080
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,520
of like a one through ten scale as far

1081
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,400
as

1082
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
how it rates stuff basically it looks at

1083
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
an email and says hey this is a six for

1084
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,359
a for anti

1085
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,960
for spam it kind of lets we're

1086
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
reasonably certain this is probably spam

1087
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,079
so you can control that if you're

1088
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,079
getting too much or too little

1089
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,680
where that's at and fine tune it it's

1090
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,079
probably going to take a little while um

1091
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,599
i haven't had to adjust ours very much

1092
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
but most of my users don't check their

1093
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
check their junk mail folder so

1094
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
i guess

1095
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
i check mine all the time and mine is

1096
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,200
usually pretty good about it

1097
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
okay

1098
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
oh like i talked about earlier on the

1099
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
summary this is like i said this will

1100
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
give you your i think top five or ten

1101
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
email five topper five topper

1102
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
holy crap

1103
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
five top users

1104
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
that will have been

1105
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
getting getting phishing emails and i a

1106
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,839
lot of times we'll send this out to them

1107
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,359
too and just to kind of give them a

1108
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,520
heads up like hey

1109
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
even though you're not seeing these

1110
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,079
emails come through they're getting

1111
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,920
stopped by microsoft

1112
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
you had 300 phishing emails got sent to

1113
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,079
your email address last month so you

1114
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,400
need to be more careful than other users

1115
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,520
if it helps

1116
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,280
i don't know i guess it's better than

1117
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
not telling them so but i i obviously if

1118
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,040
if you're going to start implementing

1119
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,400
security features

1120
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
those are the users especially mfa those

1121
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,720
are the users to start with um and

1122
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,800
depending on how big your org is and how

1123
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,560
much financial control a user has

1124
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
maybe you you convince those users to

1125
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,079
use the security key

1126
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,040
uh like like i said even with 502 even

1127
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,480
if they leave the key in their in their

1128
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,359
desktop at work it's better than

1129
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
letting them get fished

1130
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,520
here's just a look at this is the sample

1131
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,480
one

1132
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
it wasn't going to do any good much good

1133
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,720
to take a picture of mine

1134
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,640
because i would have to you know redact

1135
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,800
a lot of it obviously

1136
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
but like i said you can customize this

1137
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,680
obviously microsoft kind of picks

1138
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,119
what they think is most important and

1139
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,320
kind of shows it to you so you can kind

1140
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,280
of get an overall view

1141
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,839
and and gives you some insight and you

1142
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,839
can you can you can dig even deeper i

1143
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,040
think like i said i think you can even

1144
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,560
customize the view that you get here

1145
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,000
uh

1146
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,040
more

1147
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,920
uh more trends and stuff like that uh

1148
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,560
this is it's a good idea to keep uh keep

1149
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
an eye on this and just know the

1150
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
baseline a lot of a lot of monitoring

1151
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,359
and a lot of tracking and stuff like

1152
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,839
that is knowing that hey we usually get

1153
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,520
about four or five thousand

1154
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,839
you know

1155
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,079
malware uh emails a month or a day or

1156
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,240
whatever i think this is a day um all of

1157
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
a sudden it's 15 000.

1158
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
what's going on there's there i probably

1159
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,160
need to be doing a little more digging a

1160
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,760
little more looking at logs look a

1161
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
little more looking at splunk or great

1162
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,760
log or whatever you have and maybe maybe

1163
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
pulling up a little more of the uh

1164
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
emails that have been blocked and

1165
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
looking at what's getting blocked maybe

1166
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
it's going to just one user maybe you

1167
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,200
one user got phished and

1168
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,119
and they and they're uh now a bigger

1169
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,839
target

1170
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
okay

1171
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
we're looking for time

1172
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,640
if you have some money to spend

1173
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,000
there's a lot of things you can spend it

1174
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
on obviously microsoft is very good at

1175
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,000
taking your money they're happy to take

1176
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,640
it

1177
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
um one of the things that i wish i could

1178
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
have done then the kind of reason that

1179
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,640
prompted this talk is i wish i could

1180
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,839
have geo block some ips um our firewall

1181
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,359
i've got a lot of countries blocked

1182
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,560
because we don't do any business with

1183
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,320
them we don't access any websites from

1184
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,839
there there's no reason to even have

1185
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,599
those open a lot of the

1186
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,119
the china's the russia's a lot of the

1187
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,040
african countries a lot of the you know

1188
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,119
stuff like that i i would i would have

1189
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,800
loved to block them and i tried to block

1190
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
them but you can't do that without your

1191
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,839
azure premium ad licenses

1192
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,520
i think it's like five or six bucks a

1193
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
month just for that license but i think

1194
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,200
as far as i know

1195
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,400
if you're gonna start getting those

1196
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
licenses a lot of that stuff is included

1197
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,640
with either e3 or e5 as you're getting

1198
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,480
up so obviously they're bundling all

1199
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,839
that stuff together and giving you a

1200
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,400
better deal

1201
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,720
as you pay for azure premium id

1202
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
you get more automatic reports that you

1203
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,119
can launch and and and have controls

1204
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,280
over you get you get more logging you

1205
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,599
get longer logging you get obviously

1206
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,440
like we talked about the 90 days you if

1207
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,960
you if you want to if you want logs

1208
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
longer you have to pay for it

1209
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,040
you get more password policy control

1210
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
as far as i'm aware unless i've changed

1211
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,280
it the only real password policy control

1212
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,760
that you have over on a regular license

1213
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,480
is

1214
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,920
what they call it strong passwords

1215
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,320
basically they won't let users use just

1216
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,400
regular you know one two three four five

1217
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,480
kind of stuff and it's all or nothing

1218
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
it's on or off basically

1219
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
um this one you can control hey i want

1220
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
all my users to have at least 12

1221
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,280
characters 15 characters whatever it is

1222
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,359
you get more control over that obviously

1223
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
there's a lot more in those azure id

1224
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,920
premium licenses you get connectors with

1225
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,440
local ad and stuff like that you can

1226
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
start doing a lot of cool stuff like

1227
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,879
that

1228
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
there's a lot more control over other

1229
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,119
parts sharepoint and all that kind of

1230
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,400
stuff that you get with those azure id

1231
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
poor license too

1232
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,839
i haven't used it

1233
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,359
i had a friend actually recommend i put

1234
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,119
this in here because he's used it the

1235
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,040
phishing simulation and training that

1236
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
you can use with your users if you get

1237
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,760
defender 365 you get defender 365 level

1238
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,400
one

1239
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
with the regular premium license that's

1240
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,599
what they call it that's what you that

1241
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,040
kind of threat console and all that kind

1242
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,599
of stuff that's level one defender 356

1243
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,280
365 level one um i as far as i know i

1244
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
think you can purchase level two on its

1245
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,680
own but when you start purchasing that

1246
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,119
stuff it doesn't really make much sense

1247
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,200
you might as well just get e5 licenses

1248
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
you get bigger mailboxes you get

1249
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,160
everything that goes with that and and

1250
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,920
if you piece me a lot of this stuff

1251
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,960
you're up at 22 25 30 a month per user

1252
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,119
anyways i think the e5 licenses are in

1253
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,480
the 20s like the last time i checked it

1254
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,520
was 22 or 25 or something like that um i

1255
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,359
don't have them and my org is probably

1256
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,240
not going to pay for those so it doesn't

1257
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,119
really i don't really track it that much

1258
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,839
you also get a lot of more advanced uh

1259
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,760
threat tracking you get the heuristics

1260
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
and the behavioral analysis you can set

1261
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,280
up hey if this user all of a sudden

1262
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,520
starts moving uh all of a sudden starts

1263
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,280
deleting 50 or 100 gigs out of their

1264
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
onedrive and they haven't deleted more

1265
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,480
than a couple gigs in the last six

1266
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,319
months send an alert out i need to know

1267
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,079
about it that's some really nice stuff

1268
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
to have uh i would love to have that

1269
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,760
kind of stuff

1270
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,440
we're not a huge we don't have a huge

1271
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,160
threat model uh as far as i go so

1272
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,680
even though i'd love to nerd out on it

1273
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,359
and play with it probably not super

1274
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,280
practical

1275
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
but i've used the sofos fishing tracking

1276
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,319
before and i really like it

1277
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,079
it's i remember it's a few dollars per

1278
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,400
month per user as far as the sophos one

1279
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,920
so if you can get it included and you're

1280
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,680
already getting e5 licenses anyways you

1281
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,599
already have e5 licenses

1282
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,119
it's it works really well i kind of

1283
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
looked it over really quick and i've had

1284
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,000
friends that have used it and they said

1285
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
it worked really well and they really

1286
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
like it there's lots of lots of great

1287
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,720
training in there to prevent uh like i

1288
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
said to get prevent users from getting

1289
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,640
phished so

1290
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,040
that's it

1291
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,319
any uh

1292
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,560
any

1293
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,960
questions for the most part that's the

1294
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
one that that's what i've had set up uh

1295
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,839
as far as like the blocking the blocking

1296
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,000
phishing emails and stuff

1297
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,359
yeah i don't i think i might have

1298
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,839
tweaked it a little bit uh the defaults

1299
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,160
that for the anti-spam i think i might

1300
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,319
even turn the spam down a little bit i

1301
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,520
can't remember it's been a while since

1302
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,880
i've tweaked them but i

1303
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,400
for the most part i've left most of that

1304
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,760
stuff in the default they're they're

1305
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
pretty they're they're pretty good right

1306
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,800
at the defaults i don't like unless

1307
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,560
unless you've got a really

1308
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
fringe use case where you're getting

1309
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,160
your you have a really high profile web

1310
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,079
presence you know where you have lots of

1311
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,119
uh you know

1312
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,880
clients and stuff hitting and stuff like

1313
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,760
that

1314
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,119
i would think that the defaults are

1315
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,599
probably pretty close

1316
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,359
it's it's marking them fishing when

1317
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,520
they're not

1318
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,839
oh gotcha yeah i i said i'm guessing it

1319
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,880
just depends on the on on the on your

1320
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,440
your use case and on your you know your

1321
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
threat model and and who has you where

1322
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
those emails have been out to and who

1323
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
has them and stuff like that and what

1324
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,240
websites they've been posted to

1325
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,119
obviously i know like uh one of the

1326
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,240
reasons a lot of governmental

1327
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,599
organizations were getting hit down to

1328
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,440
florida with ransomware is

1329
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
all there all these these public

1330
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,319
officials their emails are displayed you

1331
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,480
know on the websites the their org

1332
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,319
charges displayed on there and exactly

1333
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
who's who's boss and so they're getting

1334
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,000
hit hard so

1335
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
i think that just really depends on that

1336
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,920
that's my guess most of most of our

1337
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,760
emails i'm guessing outside of a couple

1338
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,680
of our executives are not really

1339
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,440
publicly displayed so i'm guessing

1340
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
that's probably why we don't have a ton

1341
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,160
of issue with that

1342
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,839
cool anymore

1343
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,280
do you mean like a like a separate

1344
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,040
scanner like barracuda or sophos or

1345
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,839
anything like that

1346
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,359
no we're just using microsoft's yeah

1347
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,720
they're they're their controls are

1348
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,240
pretty good in there they give they give

1349
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,760
they give you a lot of great if this

1350
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,160
then that happens and there's a lot of a

1351
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,560
lot of selectables like

1352
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,800
password protected attachments or exes

1353
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
and all that kind of stuff and so it's

1354
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,920
actually there's a lot of great options

1355
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
in there i think

1356
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,598
cool any more

1357
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,359
okay

1358
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,920
thank you guys appreciate it

1359
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,590
