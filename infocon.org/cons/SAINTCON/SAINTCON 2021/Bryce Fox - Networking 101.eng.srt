1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,680
well

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,880
welcome to networking 101.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,040
um

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
we're just going to cover the very

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,080
basics of networking today so

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
hope you

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
are expecting that

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
uh disclaimer

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,359
uh we're not going very in-depth we're

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,359
covering really basic stuff about

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,880
networking

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,000
and that's

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,359
just so that

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,800
you can gain

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
an understanding of what people are

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
talking about when they're talking about

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,960
their networks

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
if you are experienced with networking

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,680
i would maybe suggest the wireshark talk

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,000
next door

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,559
but we will have a question and answer

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,399
period at the end and

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
you can throw anything at me and i'll

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,359
see if i can answer it how's that

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,680
so who am i i am bryce fox i'm also

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,640
known as pally on the sink on discord

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
i've been in it for about 30 years a

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
little more than that

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
and

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
i've done quite a few different jobs as

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
you can see there but

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
i'm currently an enterprise i.t

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
architect for the university of utah

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
i'm married

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
with five mostly adult children

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
and

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
i enjoy gaming with them and

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
history podcasts and

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
great food and great shows and traveling

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
to great the great outdoors so i enjoy

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
great things right

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,200
um

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
so

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
i consider myself a cyber security

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,479
advocate i try to

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,280
to

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
um

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
advocate for for more secure

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,160
environments in my

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
in my role

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
at the university of utah

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,640
sorry

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
mike trouble here

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
all right

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
i'm also a st con committee member

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
and so

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
i get to run the same con store

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
and so

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,959
ah dang you know what we're out of the

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
same con store badges already

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
so we were given those out at the same

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,680
con store but

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
come visit us at the same con store and

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
see if uh there's something there that

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
you would like

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
all right

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
here's an outline of what

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,319
we will

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,839
be talking about

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,879
again

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,000
if these things are way familiar to you

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
there's probably a better talk for you

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
but

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
this is what will go down

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
starting with lands

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
apparently this guy is pretty excited

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,200
leonard about his land

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
go

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
i'm losing my mic again

80
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
all right all right

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
so

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
practicalities of local area networks

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,640
um as an intro

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,159
uh

85
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
lands

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
have evolved over time

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
and

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
here we see an example of some different

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
topologies for lands

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,720
a star shape a ring a bus

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
one of the early networks i worked on

92
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
was a bus where everything was literally

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
on the same coax cable and just

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,519
connectors up to each computer off of

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,519
that cable just

96
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
kind of a

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
splice in

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
um

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,599
so your computers all connect up to a

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,200
lan or local area network

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,560
and

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
all network

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
endpoints

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
or hosts as we call them

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
connect to a land

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
your land is sometimes referred to as

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
being on the same wire even though

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
they're typically not literally on the

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
same wire they're

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
a bunch of wires aggregated together

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
right

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
so here's an example of wires aggregated

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
together through a hub

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
okay a network hub

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
and

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
traditionally

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,919
uh

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
lan

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,639
a lan shares a bridge domain

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
and thus shared broadcast domain and

121
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
thus a shared collision domain

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
and um

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
that that is um

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,080
you know those are terminology that you

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
may

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,560
find useful in conversations about

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
networks or lands

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
bridge domains broadcast domains where

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,479
traffic is sent to every

130
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
every host on a lan

131
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,080
or

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,639
a collision domain which we don't hear

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
much about collision domains anymore and

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
you'll see why here in a second

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
um so this was true

136
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
all true about network hubs

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
until they were replaced with network

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,080
switches

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
and

140
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
with a network hub

141
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
the

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
traffic

143
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
would talk

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
all over the network and so

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
a collision on the network

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
could happen

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
within the hub

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
so you know

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
one host tries to talk another tries to

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,759
talk they both try to talk but

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,919
they run into each other and so they

152
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
couldn't cross talk on the network

153
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,720
and so

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,360
that collision domain

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
was across all computers

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
with a hub

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
where when we moved to switches

158
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
we

159
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,000
we were able to reduce that collision

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
domain

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
down to just the wire between the switch

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
and the host

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
and that made it a lot more efficient

164
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,960
for

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
hosts to be able to talk on the network

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
and uh reduced that kind of error

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
on the networks

168
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
all right so a bridge domain

169
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
consists of all the hub or switch ports

170
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,919
in the lan

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,639
you can even add additional

172
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,880
ports through an additional switch

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
but

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
all of those ports

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
act together as a lan and all of the

176
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
hosts off of the ports on either one of

177
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,240
these switches

178
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,520
would be considered a lan or a local

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
area network

180
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
alan has some broadcast

181
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,639
traffic that is sent to all ports and

182
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
that is referred to as a broadcast

183
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,039
domain so

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
if if a

185
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,120
host on the network is trying to talk to

186
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
and find out something that it doesn't

187
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,080
know it might send a broadcast out on

188
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
the network and that broadcast would go

189
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
to every endpoint every host on the lan

190
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
lans adhere to the ieee 802 dot

191
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
standards and ethernet bridging

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
which is our most common form of

193
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
networking today is considered ieee

194
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
802.1

195
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,639
just in case you hear that somewhere

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
addressing on a lan

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
is based on a mac address or media

198
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
access control address

199
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
each network interface card has

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
a mac address and

201
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,039
that is i

202
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
that mac address is assigned by a

203
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
manufacturer

204
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
it's it's supposed to be unique there's

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
occasions where

206
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
it's not always been unique

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,760
but

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
the first three

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
hexadecimal numbers of a mac address

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,279
indicate the manufacturer

211
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,640
and then the last three should be a

212
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
uniquely assigned address by the

213
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
manufacturer

214
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
if you're wondering

215
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
about who the maker of a particular

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,839
device is you can do a mac address

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,040
lookup

218
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,320
search on the web for mac address lookup

219
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
and you should be able to find a site

220
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
that will tell you who the manufacturer

221
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,959
of a particular network interface card

222
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,920
is um

223
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
so

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
computers on the network

225
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
can communicate if they know each

226
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
other's mac address

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
at first they don't

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
and um

229
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
they uh

230
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,440
they they store mac addresses in a table

231
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
called an arp table uh they use an a

232
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
protocol called

233
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
address resolution protocol

234
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
which is arp

235
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
and they

236
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
when they discover

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
a mac address that's on their lan

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
they will deposit that in their arp

239
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,560
table

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
to

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
hey i might reference this again i might

242
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
use it again i might talk to them again

243
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
computers can do

244
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
an art broadcast to learn the address of

245
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
other computers

246
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
but that learning is aided by switches

247
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
these days so a lot of switches these

248
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
days are pretty smart and they keep

249
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
their own mac address table and so

250
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,399
they can sometimes answer do a proxy

251
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
response

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
and and get the job done faster as far

253
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
as discovering a mac address on on the

254
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
network

255
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,800
so for arp to truly be effective it

256
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,839
needs

257
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
to have a name or an ip address or

258
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,519
internetworking protocol

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,720
address

260
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
assigned to it

261
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
so we use tcpip protocol stacks to

262
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
assign the computer an ip address to be

263
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,000
translated to a mac address

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
used within the lan

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,720
and so here's an example of what arp

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
looks like

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,680
how it might work

268
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
so in this case system a

269
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
is saying uh he's sending out a

270
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
broadcast onto the network and it says

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
i'm looking for something uh

272
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
i'm looking for the physical address or

273
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
the mac address

274
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,240
of a node with an ip address of

275
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
141.23.56.23

276
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,000
and so in the the example you see there

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
this broadcast would go to all of the

278
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
computers on the land

279
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
uh system b would hear

280
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
the broadcast

281
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
and they would and that system that host

282
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
would respond

283
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
and they would say

284
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
the node physical address is and their

285
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
mac address

286
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:14,959
so

287
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,200
and they know that because they own that

288
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
address they have that address assigned

289
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
to them

290
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
so

291
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
right

292
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
so there's a thing called vlans

293
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,000
and we've heard of virtualization in our

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
world today and virtualization applies

295
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
to lands as well

296
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,480
so

297
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,240
modern switches are able to group their

298
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,600
physical ports into virtual lands

299
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
so you can split

300
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,639
your switch into vlan 1 and vlan 2

301
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
and

302
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
you can do more vlans in that

303
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,560
but

304
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,120
this a switch then carries multiple

305
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
vlans or broadcast domains so that in

306
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
that way

307
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,959
you separate the broadcast domains

308
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,320
into two

309
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
in this case

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
or however many vlans

311
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,519
you set up

312
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,200
and then

313
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
interconnected switches can carry

314
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
multiple vlans across one interconnect

315
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,839
by a method

316
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,360
known

317
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,560
as vlan tagging or ieee 802.1q

318
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,279
sometimes it's referred to as a trunk

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,720
or a vlan trunk or a or a tagging trunk

320
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,839
you know you'll hear different

321
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
terminology that people use

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,279
or a

323
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,680
a dot one x or a dot one q trunk

324
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,720
sorry

325
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
so let's see

326
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
also

327
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
between the two switches in this diagram

328
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,639
you can see that

329
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
both switches can carry both vlans

330
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
so you can have switch ports on

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
one switch that

332
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
are serving vlan one but then also on a

333
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
remote switch another switch in another

334
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
room on another floor of the building or

335
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
something that serves that same vlan

336
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
and you can do that with multiple vlans

337
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,880
as as well

338
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,839
so

339
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
you can't talk between

340
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
vlans or lands without

341
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,519
defining a path for them to talk to each

342
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,480
other

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
even if they're defined on the same

344
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,199
switch they don't have

345
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,399
a path

346
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
to each other to talk to each other

347
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,560
without introducing routing

348
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
and so

349
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
routing is done based on an internet

350
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,120
working protocol or ip

351
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
um

352
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
simple routing configurations will often

353
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
use static or manually set

354
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,800
not automatically chain changeable

355
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
routes so so just static routing

356
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,519
or

357
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,759
more complex routing configurations will

358
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
often use dynamic routing protocols such

359
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
as ospf and bgp

360
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,480
for example here's

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,839
a router

362
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,000
introduced into this

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
environment and

364
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,279
and we can

365
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
trunk

366
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,320
those two vlans to the router

367
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,279
the router can then bridge

368
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,560
the the gap or provide a gateway between

369
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,680
those two networks

370
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,199
um

371
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,480
more modern

372
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
networks

373
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,639
are typically using a

374
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
multi-layer switch to do this

375
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
so it's a switch

376
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,279
but it has um what we call layer three

377
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
sorry i'm getting a call

378
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,720
i should

379
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,079
silence my phone huh

380
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,920
sorry

381
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,800
um

382
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
and so

383
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
a multi-layer switch provides that

384
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
routing

385
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,680
layer

386
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
or layer three as we often call it

387
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
when we talk about routing we're talking

388
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,959
about layer three now i'm gonna get to

389
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,959
what layer three means here in just a

390
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
second when we talk about the osi model

391
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,880
but

392
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
i wanted to point out that wired and

393
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
wireless lans

394
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,000
exist

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,399
you can have either or both

396
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,320
you can even

397
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
connect them together to where

398
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,439
they're

399
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
the same network

400
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,480
um

401
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
so you can have

402
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
uh

403
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,760
elements of of a land that are wireless

404
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,359
and elements are wired

405
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
although that's probably not considered

406
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
a best practice

407
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
but that's typically what we do in our

408
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,160
homes right

409
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
all right now for the seven layer

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,559
burrito they don't make those at

411
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
taco bell anymore apparently

412
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,559
but

413
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
we used to

414
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
in trying to remember the layers of the

415
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,200
osi model we used to refer to it as a

416
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
layer burrito because there's seven

417
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,480
layers of the osi networking model

418
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
and osi is a standards organization and

419
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,720
international standards organization

420
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
that

421
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
defined this model

422
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
for

423
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,159
um

424
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,160
inter-networking and um

425
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
so

426
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
it

427
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
the model is split into host layers um

428
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,640
and

429
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
media layers

430
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
and this

431
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
kind of has a lot to do with

432
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,320
software and hardware

433
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,640
but then there's some crossover between

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,600
there

435
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
so

436
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
let's go over the lower layers here

437
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
first

438
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
the the lowest layer on the osi model is

439
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,679
the physical layer

440
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,320
this involves things like network

441
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
interface cards

442
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,120
coax cable

443
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,160
cat6e cable wireless

444
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
hubs repeaters

445
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
so anything that maintains an electric

446
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
signal over the wire

447
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,640
that's

448
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,840
kind of your physical layer or layer one

449
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
layer two of the osi model

450
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,760
talks about frames

451
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,280
it defines

452
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
segments of data or

453
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,400
groupings of data as frames of data

454
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,039
this involves

455
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,320
our common networking

456
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,400
layers of

457
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
well

458
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,600
ethernet ppp or which is point-to-point

459
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
protocol switch

460
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
switches bridges

461
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
so this is just

462
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
one layer of intelligence

463
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
up from like the signal

464
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
and then

465
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
the third layer would be the network

466
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
layer

467
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
this is where we introduce protocols

468
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,918
like internetworking protocol ip

469
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,840
as well as some of its components like

470
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,520
icmp igmp

471
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
ipsec

472
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,280
but it's also important to note that

473
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
at this layer

474
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
you

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
sorry

476
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
you can perform filtering

477
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
so firewalls

478
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
can act on data on this layer

479
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
and and more modern firewalls

480
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,799
have

481
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,120
ways to inspect

482
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,640
data on the wire and be able to to act

483
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
on more than just this

484
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
but let's look at the

485
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
upper layers here

486
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
uh the transport layer layer four

487
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
also is filterable

488
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
um

489
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,039
there are a few firewalls that will

490
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,240
look at

491
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,039
some

492
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
whether there's suspicious things going

493
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
on with some of the layers

494
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,039
above that but

495
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
but very little

496
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
beyond that they

497
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
they might confirm that

498
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
http

499
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,919
traffic

500
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,400
is what it says it is you know

501
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,120
but

502
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
not a heck of a lot of interrogation

503
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,840
into that

504
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,360
traffic beyond just

505
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,000
basic filtering that can be done based

506
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
on tcp which is trans

507
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
transport control protocol

508
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
or udp

509
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,760
which is user datagram protocol

510
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,559
these protocols are used to

511
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,159
control the end-to-end connections and

512
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,280
describe

513
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,640
basically

514
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,679
how

515
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,640
to expect a connection to to link up

516
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
you'll often hear people

517
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,640
refer to

518
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,760
what port is at what what port does that

519
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
service talk on

520
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,480
on the network or you know what port is

521
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
open on your server

522
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,880
for that and we're talking about tcp and

523
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
udp ports

524
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,159
when we're talking about that

525
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,360
so

526
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,559
those ports are just numbers that that

527
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
describe

528
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,799
what basically what protocol you're

529
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
talking and

530
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,200
again filtering can be based on those

531
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
ports so it's

532
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
often important to know if you're

533
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,840
running a service on a server

534
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,159
what those ports are

535
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,600
so that you know how to tell

536
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,480
someone

537
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
who manages the firewall hey

538
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,760
i need this port open

539
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
and i need this port open because my

540
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,918
server is listening on those ports

541
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,480
uh

542
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,360
so layer five the session layer um

543
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,559
sync

544
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,039
and send to port apis sockets windsock

545
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,600
the presentation layers layer six

546
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,559
so we have syntax it's kind of a syntax

547
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,159
layer um

548
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,039
kind of describes uh

549
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
formatting of files and of of

550
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
encryption

551
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,039
things like that

552
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,799
and then

553
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,799
seven is the application layer

554
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,480
um it's the end user layer it's uh kind

555
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,200
of

556
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
what what the end user sees when they're

557
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,720
looking at their computer screen is is

558
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
layer 7

559
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,679
or the application layer

560
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,159
all right

561
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,880
so

562
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
if we combine them that's kind of what

563
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
it looks like there

564
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
and

565
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
the osi model

566
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
is

567
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
is a theoretical model

568
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
um

569
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
it's kind of the

570
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
uh

571
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,679
du jour standard

572
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
um

573
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,559
but the de facto standard in our day

574
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,440
is

575
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,880
the tcp ip model and right next to it

576
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
there i've put the tcp ip model which in

577
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,640
a lot of ways kind of

578
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,080
groups

579
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
the session presentation and application

580
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,200
layers into one layer

581
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,279
because they kind of get mixed around

582
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
and

583
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
and really all of that is handled by

584
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
software

585
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
so

586
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,279
the programmers of the software can kind

587
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,760
of define how that

588
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
all happens there

589
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,960
and really that involves the packaging

590
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,080
of of data to be transported things like

591
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
that

592
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
the transport layer

593
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,720
again we're dealing with tcp and udp

594
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,799
when we look at the

595
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,799
the far right there is the

596
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,200
implementation the tcp ip stack

597
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
every computer that is on the

598
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,360
internet or your local area network

599
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
typically we'll have an ip address and

600
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,158
we'll be running a tcp ip stack

601
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
and then

602
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
you can see in the stack there's some

603
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
different elements of how it's

604
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
implemented

605
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
in the application area we see some

606
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
different applications that

607
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
are defined there and

608
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,279
and like i said the different layers the

609
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
session presentation and application

610
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
could be

611
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
handled all together in in one process

612
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
or

613
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,159
separately and layered

614
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
depending on how the programmers wrote

615
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
software

616
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
but then when we

617
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
get down to tcp and udp

618
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
that kind of defines

619
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,559
how that that transport between hosts is

620
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,799
going to work

621
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
and then there's

622
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
down in the physical and data link

623
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
layers we've got ethernet which is

624
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,799
probably our most common

625
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,760
form of network these days and then

626
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
token ring which is totally obsolete and

627
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,600
atm which is pretty darn obsolete which

628
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
we don't have very many atm networks

629
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,640
around these days i don't think

630
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
i hope not and then frame relay as well

631
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,120
although

632
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
i think there are still a few frame

633
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,159
relay

634
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,640
connections around

635
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,159
this is kind of how

636
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,240
the osi

637
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,760
stack works

638
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
so

639
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,279
you have computer a

640
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,720
has their own

641
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,559
stack

642
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,840
and

643
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
the application

644
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
the software

645
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,120
builds data files and formats them and

646
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,559
encrypts them

647
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,520
at the

648
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,440
layers five six and seven

649
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,399
and readies them packages them for

650
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,159
transport

651
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,039
and then those packages get

652
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,360
called segments at the transport layer

653
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,520
and if you were in the wireshark class

654
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,720
next door you would maybe talk about

655
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,399
oh i see the network segments or i see

656
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,600
at the

657
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
next layer down the network layer

658
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,720
the packets they talk about packet

659
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
captures

660
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
and and

661
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
capturing the data on the wire

662
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
but

663
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
this model is how the data is prepared

664
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,279
and then passed down the stack

665
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
all the way down through packets

666
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
frames at the data link layer and then

667
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
bits

668
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
at the physical layer

669
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,320
and at the physical layer it's just

670
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,200
signals it's just electrical signals

671
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,960
ones and zeros passing on the wire

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
and then when it gets to the other end

673
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
computer b

674
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,080
it passes back up the stack so

675
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,039
so

676
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,000
those

677
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,640
physical ones and zeros are converted

678
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,799
back to frames

679
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,600
and um

680
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
then to packets and then to segments

681
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
and uh

682
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
and then eventually processed by

683
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,679
software to to determine

684
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,320
how to decode it and ingest the data

685
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
so that's kind of how

686
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,279
it's envisioned that the osi model works

687
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,559
so

688
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
i don't know how many of you are techies

689
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,960
in here but i'm a techie and i

690
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,399
sometimes

691
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,440
get frustrated when everyone's asking me

692
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,120
questions but that's

693
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,919
kind of a funny meme i found

694
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,760
just to lighten the mood

695
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,799
so

696
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,600
next up we're going to talk about ipv4

697
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,799
cider block notation

698
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,360
ipv4 is what most ip addresses

699
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,679
that we're familiar with

700
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,480
are based on these days

701
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,279
even though ipv6 exists

702
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,039
and is in

703
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,840
in

704
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,799
pretty high use

705
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,960
mainly in china

706
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,919
but

707
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,240
some of the big carriers use it

708
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,120
as

709
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,960
a transport

710
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,799
for

711
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,039
their backbones

712
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,559
but

713
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,960
we're going to focus on ipv4 because

714
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
that's what's most familiar on your lan

715
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
on your local area network

716
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,320
so here's an example of an ip address um

717
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,159
in fact this is

718
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,360
a dixie college ip address

719
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
um

720
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,840
so 144.38.112.14

721
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,039
[Music]

722
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
and

723
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,600
that's what it looks like in binary

724
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,360
so

725
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
each of these numbers separated by a dot

726
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,679
is called an octet

727
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,159
and the reason is called an octet is

728
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
because

729
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,720
there's eight

730
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,519
binary numbers

731
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,320
that represent that

732
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,000
that really are the actual address

733
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,960
and um those binary numbers are combined

734
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
to make a decimal number

735
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
between 0 and 255

736
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,200
and and that's how those

737
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,679
those work um

738
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,679
in the table here

739
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,200
we can see

740
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,240
the slots of a binary

741
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,440
octet

742
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
okay

743
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,720
and over in the first slot on the right

744
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,679
you see

745
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,360
the value of one

746
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
is underneath it

747
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
and for everywhere

748
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
every every slot that has a one that

749
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
means it's on i've turned it on and what

750
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
it means is i've turned on a one

751
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
or i've turned on a two

752
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,399
or a four or an eight or a 16 or a 32 or

753
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,760
64

754
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
or a

755
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,559
128.

756
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,120
and if you added all those numbers up it

757
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,480
add up to 255

758
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,159
but for instance in the

759
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,080
rows below

760
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
we have

761
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,640
a one one zero one zero one zero zero

762
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,120
as the binary address but um

763
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,159
that that means that i'm i'm adding up

764
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,519
a 128 a 64

765
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,440
a 16

766
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
a 4

767
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,640
and the those other

768
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
spaces those other

769
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
zeros

770
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,080
mean that they're zero they're not

771
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,279
present

772
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,200
we're not calling for them

773
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
so when you add that up

774
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,320
you get the number 212 which is

775
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,919
in this case the third octet of

776
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,360
of this ip address 144.38.112.14.

777
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,080
so

778
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,919
in ip addressing uh there's a concept

779
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
called subnet masks and if you've ever

780
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,000
defined your ip address for a server or

781
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,679
for a workstation

782
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,080
you probably know that you needed to

783
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
define the subnet mask

784
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
and

785
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,720
it

786
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,679
what it does is it provides a way to

787
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,640
set the boundaries of where what the

788
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
network address is

789
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,279
and what are the valid host addresses

790
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,600
within the network and so

791
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,080
here for instance um

792
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
a

793
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,320
255.255.255.0 as a subnet mask means

794
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
that the

795
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
first three octets

796
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
uh which are

797
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,719
completely ones in binary right

798
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,320
that means 255 right so

799
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,239
those are the first three octets

800
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,879
and then where we see zeros

801
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
after that

802
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,359
or

803
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,719
a lower number than 255 we know that

804
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,560
that's where the boundary is

805
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,079
and so

806
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,639
in a network like what we're depicting

807
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
here

808
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,719
you would be able to have up to

809
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,480
254 addresses or so in a single network

810
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
a network that is called

811
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,239
150 or 144.38.212.

812
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,320
that's kind of the network address and

813
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,918
then

814
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:52,879
the

815
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,440
the in portion there is is the hosts

816
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
so

817
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,240
in the early days of ip addressing there

818
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,160
was what we called

819
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,320
classful

820
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,000
networks

821
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and classful networks

822
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,280
were defined by a range of numbers for

823
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,839
the in the first octet of the ip address

824
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,720
and

825
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,680
here we can see in this table

826
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
a class a network

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,320
would be um

828
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,160
from 0 to 127

829
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
and

830
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,520
would have a subnet mask

831
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,440
a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0

832
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,430
and then

833
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,119
[Music]

834
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,640
down the line you can see the

835
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
definitions of you know where those

836
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,800
boundaries of class a class b and class

837
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
c networks were

838
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,440
and what that did is it said

839
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
okay

840
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,440
you can

841
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,920
only the only valid

842
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,720
subnet mask that you can use within that

843
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,839
class

844
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,960
is this and so for a class a it was

845
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,960
255.0.0.0

846
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
and

847
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
in a class b it was

848
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
two octets of 255s

849
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
and 0.0

850
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,079
and in the class c it was three 255's

851
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,240
and as dot zero

852
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,320
so um also if we consider that in the

853
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
form of binary

854
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,440
um there's the binary numbers and those

855
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,839
are the only valid binary numbers

856
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,359
for those classes

857
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,400
and

858
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
you can see the bits

859
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,520
that are represented there the class a

860
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,640
was represented by an 8-bit 8-bit mask

861
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,680
a class b was represented by a 16-bit

862
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
mask

863
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,520
and a class c by a 24-bit mask and when

864
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
i say bits that's how many

865
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
numbers

866
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
are

867
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,720
how many binary numbers are used in the

868
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,440
definition of the network

869
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,200
not the hosts

870
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,400
okay

871
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,640
the definition of the network

872
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
is the the bits of oven of the network

873
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
portion

874
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
so

875
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,160
this kind of was a waste of addressing

876
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,560
space and they were finding okay we

877
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,200
needed we need more addresses and so

878
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,119
they introduced

879
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,440
what they call cider

880
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,839
as a cidr or classless inter-domain

881
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,320
routing

882
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,160
sometimes we refer to

883
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,560
[Music]

884
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,400
this notation system as variable length

885
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,320
subnet masking

886
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,000
um

887
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,520
and so

888
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,680
no longer

889
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,800
did classes mean anything

890
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,280
out of a class a you could you could

891
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,119
break up your networks

892
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,800
to whatever

893
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,280
size you wanted to

894
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,839
based on just defining what the bit

895
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,800
boundary was uh and you could you could

896
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
define them as low as

897
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,839
as

898
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,078
um

899
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,800
uh to 250 or uh or 128.0.0.0

900
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,839
as a

901
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,320
subnet mask

902
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,359
and

903
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,240
up to 255.255.255.252.

904
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,280
which

905
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,520
is

906
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,960
just really it's just two hosts allowed

907
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
on the network

908
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,200
and and point-to-point connections

909
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,880
are an ideal situation for using

910
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,160
a mask like that

911
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,040
but also that bit portion

912
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,079
the valid bit portions

913
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,000
were 1 through 30. so you so an ip

914
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
address is 32 bits

915
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,839
and you could define them a subnet mask

916
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,079
anywhere from one to

917
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,240
30 bits

918
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,960
so

919
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,920
anyway

920
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,960
uh

921
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,560
so we got into a situation where

922
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
we um

923
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,760
would

924
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
call out an ip address and and then a

925
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
subnet mask and we would

926
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,599
say oh hey this subnet mask is

927
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,599
255.255.255.224

928
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,880
okay 224 meaning that it's a network of

929
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
about 30 hosts

930
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
there came about the notation of using a

931
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,520
slash

932
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,160
and then the bit number

933
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,160
to to help you to shorten that to say oh

934
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,200
this is a slash 27 network

935
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,520
and then that that meant something to

936
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,480
someone

937
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,800
and you know then um like 32

938
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,920
uh in the third octet became a

939
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
a valid

940
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
boundary for a network that was a valid

941
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
network

942
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
under classless inter-domain routing

943
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,359
but

944
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,760
calculating all those

945
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,880
can be

946
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,040
a little mind-boggling

947
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,040
so i i suggest you do a web search

948
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,839
for cider notation

949
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,079
cheat sheet or cidr notation cheat sheet

950
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,720
or cider notation calculator calculators

951
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
are nice too

952
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,680
but but

953
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,079
explore a one of those cheat sheets that

954
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,839
you can find online

955
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,079
and you can find some pretty interesting

956
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,680
things and you can further your

957
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,839
understanding of how those

958
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,839
those bit boundaries work

959
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,920
uh for networks

960
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
for classless inter-domain routing

961
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
but then if you're going after a network

962
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
certification

963
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
memorization is your friend

964
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,759
so

965
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,319
all right

966
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,680
i think i'm going to get a drink

967
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,240
i thought that was a funny one

968
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,920
they always call the installation

969
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,599
of software

970
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,000
install wizard

971
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
so

972
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
please wait for the wizard to install

973
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,319
the software

974
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,640
okay

975
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,079
so let's talk about the basics of tcp ip

976
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,040
and the internet

977
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
first of all

978
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,760
talking about addresses on the internet

979
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,359
as ip addresses is kind of

980
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,680
archaic

981
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,560
and so we introduced dns

982
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,240
long long ago

983
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,560
pretty early in the days of

984
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,319
of ip

985
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,119
dns provides kind of a phone book

986
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,319
service for the internet

987
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,560
so um

988
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
it's a way for us to not have to know

989
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,200
the ip address and i can just say i want

990
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,760
to go to microsoft.com and i don't care

991
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
what their ip address is

992
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,800
and

993
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,280
if i put that into my browser

994
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,079
and

995
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,520
go there

996
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
it will uh

997
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,520
it will translate that for me

998
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,319
and so all of our computers have dns

999
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,280
they use a dns server to

1000
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,760
be able to tell us tell our computers

1001
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,839
back

1002
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,200
oh okay the name you asked for was this

1003
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,359
okay this is the ip address that you

1004
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,920
want to connect to to get that

1005
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
and so

1006
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,720
uh with dns that's that's what we get

1007
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,359
you know that's the way it works and

1008
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,079
you request something a dns request goes

1009
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
out from your computer

1010
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,560
and a response comes back from the dns

1011
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,040
server saying

1012
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,920
i know that or i know how you can find

1013
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
out that

1014
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,400
and helps you to find the the correct

1015
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,319
address associated with the name

1016
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,839
um

1017
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,839
you can you can even buy your own domain

1018
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,880
name there's registrars out there that

1019
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,839
you can

1020
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,119
go to

1021
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,480
to buy a domain name

1022
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,119
you do have to tell them what dns

1023
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,880
servers you want to use a lot of

1024
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,359
registrars of

1025
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,800
names will even offer their own dns

1026
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
servers for you to use

1027
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
if you have an account with them

1028
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,319
so

1029
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,560
and and sometimes you know when you

1030
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,800
pay to register with them they'll offer

1031
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,760
those services free

1032
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,680
um

1033
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,040
[Music]

1034
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,880
tcp and udp

1035
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,480
uh tcp versus udp tcp

1036
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
is is very important to

1037
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,960
the tcp ip stack that's why we call it

1038
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
tcpip because

1039
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,040
ip relies on tcp a lot

1040
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,720
tcp is considered connected state memory

1041
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,520
uh

1042
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,720
oriented by a byte stream

1043
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,680
ordered data delivery reliable error

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,720
free

1045
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,359
relatively

1046
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,480
does a handshake process

1047
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,839
it does it maintains flow control

1048
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,040
relatively slow because it requires a

1049
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,560
lot of back and forth talk

1050
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,920
and point to point it's one point to

1051
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
another and then security elements

1052
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,640
at tcp

1053
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,680
are you know for example ssl with tls

1054
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,280
you see that implemented on http a lot

1055
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,040
of times

1056
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,480
so that's why we have https

1057
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,880
in addresses a lot

1058
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,359
on the udp side it's considered

1059
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,160
connectionless

1060
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,760
stateless

1061
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,000
so

1062
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,640
we don't keep track of what stage of of

1063
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,440
talking it's in

1064
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,200
packet

1065
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,440
datagrams

1066
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,820
no sequence guarantee is lossy

1067
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,160
[Music]

1068
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,280
meaning it can lose data

1069
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,760
and and

1070
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,400
you'd expect that there can be loss and

1071
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
that you might

1072
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
you know say it's a phone call you might

1073
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,359
hear a cut out of the of the voice or

1074
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,640
something

1075
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,160
air packets discarded no handshakes no

1076
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
flow control relatively fast

1077
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,359
supports multicast

1078
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,000
security

1079
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,000
is done with dtls which actually

1080
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,119
kind of adds some elements of sequencing

1081
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,800
and

1082
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,599
flow control

1083
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,520
so

1084
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,400
this is a picture depicting kind of how

1085
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,839
that works with tcp

1086
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,440
you have a conversation that starts with

1087
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,599
a

1088
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
request to to

1089
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,599
ask for something

1090
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,800
and a an acknowledgement back

1091
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,240
so they call it a sin a sin act is an

1092
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,359
acknowledgement and then an act

1093
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,760
is an acknowledgement that i got the

1094
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,520
connection i got i got the

1095
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,839
acknowledgement back and once that

1096
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,119
process is that handshake is done

1097
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,160
then

1098
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
with tcp

1099
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,079
both the server and the client in this

1100
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,480
case know that they can just continue

1101
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,520
carrying on a conversation on that port

1102
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,760
in the case of udp

1103
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,599
a request is sent

1104
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,720
a response is sent back

1105
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,599
and

1106
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,440
just kept keeps sending the response

1107
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,920
and doesn't have any acknowledgement of

1108
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,760
whether it's received

1109
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,559
whether that data is ingested or

1110
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,880
anything

1111
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
if

1112
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,359
we implement

1113
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,599
controls we have to do it up in the

1114
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,160
application layer of the osi model or

1115
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
the the tcp ip model

1116
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,200
that's where

1117
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,680
you would perform your your software

1118
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,240
would have to perform your error

1119
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,960
checking and things like that

1120
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,280
rather than the protocol

1121
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,599
doing air checking and handshake and

1122
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,200
things like that and flow control

1123
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,640
all right

1124
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,559
so real quick we're going to just

1125
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,200
briefly talk about routing and autino

1126
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,520
autonomous systems

1127
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,480
um

1128
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,680
ip routing is based on publicly known ip

1129
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,119
address

1130
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,839
assignments

1131
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,480
um

1132
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,520
whatever organization you belong to has

1133
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,880
typically an assignment of addresses

1134
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,400
for you to use

1135
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,960
sometimes there are sub assignments

1136
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,559
from an isp

1137
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,280
uh where you just are using a couple of

1138
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,040
their ip addresses

1139
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,280
you are supposed to route only ip

1140
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,760
addresses assigned to your organization

1141
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,119
apparently

1142
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,599
i don't know

1143
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,280
i think some hackers do try to to route

1144
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,800
other addresses

1145
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,839
but um autonomous system numbers there's

1146
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,720
a registry of numbers that is used to

1147
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,759
determine whether

1148
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,960
it's a

1149
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,240
valid request to route ip addresses

1150
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,079
and

1151
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,400
autonomous system numbers they used to

1152
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,599
be

1153
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,079
you could look them up

1154
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,599
publicly but

1155
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,280
they've kind of hidden them a little bit

1156
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,720
more

1157
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
to try to help

1158
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,760
prevent

1159
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,559
spoofing of addressing but

1160
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
we're going to

1161
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
see if we can go to a

1162
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,680
quick demonstration of

1163
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,960
how to use aaron.net

1164
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,400
aaron in

1165
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,680
america is is the registry for ip

1166
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,240
addresses

1167
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,640
for instance i can go to aaron.net

1168
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,000
and i can uh

1169
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,880
oops

1170
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,680
oh go

1171
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,480
my sink cone connection is gone

1172
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,559
i guess i ought to show you the

1173
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,920
aaron.net huh

1174
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,440
and

1175
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,359
i i can

1176
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,279
put in an ip address there

1177
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,839
let's see

1178
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,839
sorry

1179
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,079
for instance i'll put in

1180
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,559
an ip address from the university of

1181
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
utah

1182
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,400
trying to see

1183
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,000
ah did i screw up

1184
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,280
okay

1185
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,240
i did not all right so

1186
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,720
there it's showing me

1187
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,359
what network that ip address belongs to

1188
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,520
and if you scroll down

1189
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,319
in

1190
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,880
this description here it shows you what

1191
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,119
they call the network

1192
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,760
what it's registered as

1193
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,160
they show you

1194
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,640
the network range of that network um

1195
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,480
the cider block

1196
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,880
notation for that network

1197
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,640
they show you

1198
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,000
um

1199
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,119
the name of it let's see where's the org

1200
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,480
name

1201
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
is that the org name right there

1202
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,079
sorry

1203
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,559
i should have my screen duplicated but i

1204
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,760
don't

1205
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,440
um

1206
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,559
so with the org name

1207
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,200
you can

1208
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,640
copy that and you can do a new lookup

1209
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,359
and you can find out

1210
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,839
for instance on the university of utah

1211
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,800
oh that's not it okay i i think i

1212
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,880
know what it is

1213
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,400
university is

1214
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,040

on aaron you can

1221
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,880
search for

1222
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,800
and find

1223
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,440
um various uh

1224
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
network addresses and find out who they

1225
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,960
belong to and

1226
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,760
a lot of uh logging systems will use

1227
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,359
this to look up

1228
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,960
um

1229
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,200
what what networks belong to whom

1230
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,760
all right

but anyway that's some basics of

1236
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,480
networking um
