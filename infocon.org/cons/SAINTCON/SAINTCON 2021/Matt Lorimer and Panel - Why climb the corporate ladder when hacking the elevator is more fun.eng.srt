1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
is for the why hack the co or why climb

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,319
the corporate ladder when hacking the

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240

he's there for you

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
um anyway the idea is to we're all

11

infosec people we all want to do what's

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
best for us we all want to grow

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
sometimes that growth is in comfort of

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
we want a better we want more pay

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
sometimes we want more responsibilities

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
sometimes we want something that fits

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
our lifestyle better but we always want

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
to grow and change and get better in one

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,320
way or another

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
and so this kind of i chose an

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,160
interesting selection of people

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,760

years ago

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
because matt was my boss at the time and

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,080
he got me involved as a volunteer so

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,759

george so if we want to talk about

136

where lifestyle and career meets and how

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
to make that happen

138
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,479
maybe some some breadcrumbs across that

139
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
background we can chat about

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
and mark also helped um organize women

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
in cyber security it's kind of funny

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,479
because

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,360
mark called me up and said hey sherry do

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,880
you want to do you want to help create

145

this organization for women in cyber

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
security and then he calls all the other

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
female executives we have on our board

148
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
and so it's just i just i don't know

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
kind of a little funny twist there that

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
mark's the one that pulled that together

151
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
that'll start somewhere

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
jobs and changed changed careers a few

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,919
times how did you identify and decide it

173
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,440
was time to make a move and take the

174
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
next step in your career to make a

175
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
change

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
they laid off the security team

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
oh geez

178
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,280
but but i got a job shortly thereafter

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
that was one sign that was an obvious

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,759
sign

181
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
that's really bad good sign if you don't

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
have a job you should get one

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
words to live by

184
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
and just throwing this out there i'm

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
hiring like seven people at a fortune

186
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
100 company and i'm really fun to work

187
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
with so so talk to me

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
i think in the opportunity to change

189
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
careers one you're going to know as soon

190
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,479
as you're bored and not enjoying or

191
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
having fun anymore or it's interesting

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
and that may

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
be a good indicator that it's time to

194
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,199
change and then

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,039
i mean i had some advice early on it's

196
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
actually probably good to replant

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,840
yourself

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
every five to seven years and that may

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,199
not necessarily mean changing the

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
company but

201
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
disrupt what you're comfortable with put

202
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
yourself in a different seat do

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,479
something else if you're working in

204
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
the sock

205
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
you know go over and see if you can

206
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
build some skill on the apsec team or

207
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,560
vice versa so

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
i'm going to echo what mark said and i

209
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
think you nailed it the

210
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,240
passion is the word i would describe if

211
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
you lose your passion it's time to re

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
replant yourself whether that's within

213
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
the org or the new one

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
i stayed in an organization for 17 years

215
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
i loved the org it was awesome they were

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
good to me

217
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,160
fantastic place to work

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
but there came a point in time where i

219
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
just

220
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
didn't have the passion anymore and it

221
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
was time to go and it was it it was a

222
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
good sign for me but

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,479
anyone else or should we go to

224
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,560
um i'll just add to that that i mean i

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
think as you're looking for a company to

226
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,879
work for you know ask a lot of questions

227
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
about the culture and make sure you

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
understand what that's like because i

229
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,639
think all of us have kind of worked in

230
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,240
an environment where it was a little a

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
little toxic or just you know

232
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,599
uncomfortable and you didn't realize

233
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
that coming in and no one wants to be

234
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,400
there

235
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
you want to work it in a you know an

236
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,520
environment where the culture is great

237
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,759
and people are being lifted up and and

238
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
their strengths are ignited so look for

239
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,199
that as you're looking for a business to

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,120
go into because obviously

241
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
yeah that's a big reason why i think

242
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
people do leave the companies they're

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
currently in besides being laid off

244
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
don't get laid off

245
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
okay cool we'll start with a question

246
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
here

247
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
hi there um

248
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
so my question is right now i'm an

249
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,958
analyst at a third party sock

250
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
my goal is to get into incident response

251
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,200
but i'm concerned that because i'm

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
suggesting mitigations and not actually

253
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
applying them myself because it's third

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
party that that's going to make it much

255
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,399
more difficult to get into that role i

256
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,839
was wondering if you had any experience

257
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,399
or advice for that

258
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,880
so um i'll tell you what i think uh i

259
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
think that there there certainly are

260
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
some challenges with that and as a

261
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
person i think some of us have done a

262
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
lot of interviewing over the years

263
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
finding someone who has experience in

264
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
something is usually seen as something

265
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
good but i think sherry actually in her

266
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,279
talk yesterday talked about how

267
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
important it is to find people who are

268
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
curious about things and want to learn

269
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
and so demonstrating that would be

270
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,920
really important and i would say there

271
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
are also a lot of open source

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
opportunities for you to contribute that

273
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
might show both of those things

274
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
simultaneously so those are two

275
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
suggestions that i would have

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
i can teach you how to do whatever task

277
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
i need i can't teach you how to care

278
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
about whatever task i need so find ways

279
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
whether that's i really wanted to learn

280
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
how to do incident response so i built a

281
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
lab in my basement on raspberry pi's and

282
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
i

283
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
downloaded p caps from the internet and

284
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
figured out you know whatever you're

285
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
doing for threat hunting incident

286
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
response whatever show the passion show

287
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,399
the curiosity but that's

288
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
i was just going to echo exactly he's a

289
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
good one to answer

290
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,120
um if if you don't have experience in

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
the field you need to demonstrate

292
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,519
passion for it and so you need some kind

293
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,680
of side something or rather that that is

294
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
evidence that you like doing the thing

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
for me

296
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
that was my oscp

297
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
i was a developer but didn't have a lot

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
of like specific

299
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
security background but going for an

300
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
osap really demonstrates that

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
i'm interested and invested in security

302
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
if you don't know that's no small feat

303
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
like him i was his boss when he got it

304
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
and i was thinking about getting it and

305
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
i felt bad that here's this kid that

306
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
just i'm gonna get it in three months

307
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
later i'm done and it was pretty

308
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
impressive to see

309
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
and from an employer standpoint i'm like

310
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
hire that kid he's going places

311
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
yeah and i would just add to that i mean

312
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
take advantage of things like saintcon

313
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,560
you know because when i look at like my

314
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
education and my experience honestly i

315
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
think i learned more in doing like um

316
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,600
ethical hacking challenges at sans and

317
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
in environments kind of like this doing

318
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
the cryptography challenges even right

319
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
teaches you a lot because it does a lot

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
you know it involves a lot of analytical

321
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
thinking and breaking stuff down so get

322
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
involved in those kind of things because

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
you know a lot of them are free and

324
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
they're around you and then you have

325
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
this community of people who can

326
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,560
constantly teach you and help you

327
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
have one more thing

328
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
get a mentor

329
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
and we'll probably say that a thousand

330
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,040
times during or maybe i will i don't

331
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
know but get a mentor find someone who

332
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,399
has the job that you want

333
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
and talk to them a lot

334
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
and if you don't have a mentor turn to

335
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
the person next to you and say hi i'm

336
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
matt i don't know you what's your name

337
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
and it turns out that one of them

338
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,199
very well might end up being your mentor

339
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,920
hello panel

340
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
first time caller long time listener

341
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,000
uh do you have advice if you look at

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
twitter and you watch infosec twitter

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
it seems to be a lot of burnout in the

344
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
community

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
do you have advice

346
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
for

347
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
diminishing the amount of burnout as we

348
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
go through our careers

349
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
are you saying for you personally or for

350
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
your organization or both at industry at

351
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
large

352
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,079
so i think a lot of burnout is actually

353
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,720
highly tied to mental health

354
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
right and understanding what you're

355
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
involved in i think a great lesson in

356
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
that was actually with uh

357
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
uh

358
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
the cso for aws steve schmidt

359
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
yeah he was a fireside chat he

360
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
volunteers part-time as a emt part first

361
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,279
responder

362
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,760
and he said we get an incident and andy

363
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
jassy's like how are you not losing your

364
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
mind right now like this is going on and

365
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
he said i had someone dying in my arms

366
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,839
yesterday

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
when i was out responding as part of

368
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
this emt

369
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
so

370
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
your mental state and health and where

371
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
you're at plays a big part to kind of

372
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
burn out and

373
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
you know cyber security is a huge domain

374
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
right

375
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
building a mental muscle that you can

376
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
control what you can control

377
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
is very important secondly is setting

378
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
expectations with those that you're

379
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,399
accountable to

380
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,040
whether that's in your social personal

381
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
social circles or in your employer and i

382
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
would say that burnout with your

383
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
employer is particularly important

384
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
because if you set

385
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,639
risk tolerance expectations here's what

386
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,959
we're building up to or the resources we

387
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
need to do that

388
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
you can help mitigate

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
some of that that burnout and uh yeah

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
that's where i'd go

391
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
so for those of you who may not read a

392
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,279
lot of the

393
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,160
the journalistic publications recently

394
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
2021 has been dubbed the great

395
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
resignation because of how many people

396
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
feel like that and it's not just in

397
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
infosec it's across

398
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,519
the country and across the world and i

399
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,760
think mark is absolutely right it's tied

400
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
very much to mental health

401
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
i would suggest that you find ways to

402
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,639
talk to other people and get some of

403
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
your thoughts and feelings out sometimes

404
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
that's really helpful

405
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,279
mental health is a really big deal

406
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,959
consider getting professional help and i

407
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,880
don't mean that you're in a situation

408
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,480
where it's horrible or you're crazy or

409
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
anything those are all weird like

410
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
historical things that we think about

411
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
for that but

412
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,440
it's just health find a way to to take

413
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
care of yourself and i would also say

414
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,079
another really important factor that

415
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,959
i've found in in my career is

416
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,440
being able to deal with stress

417
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
stress is the thing that drags us down

418
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
when you're feeling burned out and if

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
you have no avenue and no hope for

420
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
finding an avenue for solving that

421
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,680
you're going to burn out there's no way

422
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
you can not

423
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,160
so i would suggest you find a way to

424
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
to handle that disconnect from that

425
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
reconnect or or get a solution once

426
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
again get a mentor

427
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,800
find someone in your company or in your

428
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
organization who cares about the things

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
that are really grating on you

430
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
and come together with a plan to

431
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,959
maybe not solve it but take the next

432
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
step

433
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,399
i would say with the mental health thing

434
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
if you see signs

435
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
it's time to talk we know it's not bad

436
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
you know it's not bad but if you wait

437
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
until it is bad then it's a lot

438
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,199
most family members have had mental

439
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
health problems and they waited until it

440
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
was bad and when it was bad they were in

441
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
a place where they couldn't get the help

442
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,079
because it

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
they were so destabilized that they

444
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
couldn't do it without intervention if

445
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
you're seeing signs

446
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
please please talk to someone whether

447
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,639
it's a friend or a professional whatever

448
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
you need do it early don't wait until

449
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,160
it's too bad

450
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,680
so i don't have a lot of experience in

451
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,639
the area

452
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
i'm very new to my career

453
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,399
but i do have a couple of thoughts that

454
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
i think are relevant i think finding

455
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,279
things outside of a screen to do can be

456
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,160
very helpful to unplug um i tried

457
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
recently um doing bug bounty on the side

458
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,839
just to like see if i could earn some

459
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
extra cash and i found it like affected

460
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,759
my will to

461
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,560
work

462
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
like on a day-to-day like i just got

463
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
tired of spending a couple of hours

464
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,120
doing more work at night even though i

465
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
dubbed it as fun

466
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
um

467
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,399
and that just didn't work for me um

468
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,320
other another thing is um i think

469
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,240
evaluating priorities on a regular basis

470
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
is important like what are your

471
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
priorities in your life

472
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,199
respecting career respecting family

473
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
social extracurricular obligations

474
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,639
and it it's helpful to to balance those

475
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,000
and see where those are in your life at

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,959
the moment

477
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,240
and then the last thing i'd say is to

478
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
learn how to say no

479
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,839
that's a skill and i'm working on it

480
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,560
um obviously because i'm here

481
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
um

482
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,959
but but if if you can look at those

483
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,519
priorities and if

484
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
there is an opportunity that comes that

485
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
does not fall in line with those those

486
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,279
priorities

487
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
then it can be good opportunity to say

488
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,359
no

489
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,639
thank you

490
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,160
no one else is behind me so i'm going to

491
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,520
ask another question if that's okay

492
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,240
so in

493
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,880
in utah in this industry

494
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,679
there are not many cisos that have a

495
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,679
seat at the table with the rest of the

496
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
chief executives

497
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,359
should that change and how do we as an

498
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
industry

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
if if it should how do we get a seat at

500
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,079
the table

501
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
uh yes um

502
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
it needs to it needs to change right if

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
we're going to promote and say

504
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,679
you know information security risk is

505
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,919
business risk and how do those tie

506
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,520
together that should

507
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
have that seat at the table i think you

508
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,039
know

509
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
even in i'll say some companies you say

510
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
well there's even tears at the table

511
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
there's like the really big kids table

512
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
and that's our like in my instance

513
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
that's the ceo the cfo and the general

514
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
counsel

515
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,280
then there's like the teenagers table

516
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
and that has like the cto

517
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
the the svp for like supply chain and

518
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,360
some other pieces like you know that

519
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
and

520
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
getting mixed up in that then comes a

521
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
side question of where should the cso

522
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
report

523
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,880
my personal and i'll take them back just

524
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
to address that really quick is report

525
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
to the person that cares about it

526
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
and everybody gets all bent out of shape

527
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
oh my gosh i report to the cio my life's

528
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
the worst like

529
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
is the cio supportive is he giving you

530
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,120
air cover are you having good

531
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
discussions

532
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
that seems pretty good

533
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
right is it your gender is it the

534
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
general counsel that cares the most then

535
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
that's probably where you should report

536
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
no i've got a report to the ceo

537
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
uh the guy that's 15 direct reports

538
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
you're gonna get like five minutes with

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
him like

540
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,039
twice a year

541
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,320
right so

542
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
there's part so getting to that seat to

543
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,000
the table is important

544
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
uh i would implore that the

545
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,679
security leader that has the top

546
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
responsibility the table you've got to

547
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,559
get to

548
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,320
is you need to be able to report to the

549
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
board on a periodic basis

550
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
so as much as it's important everyone

551
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
wants to be in the grind like trust me i

552
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
go to meetings it's like

553
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
it's all important caveat

554
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,799
let's talk about some sales plans for

555
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,559
the next three hours

556
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,919
like is this the table i wanted to be at

557
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,760
i'm not sure

558
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,799
but

559
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,200
being able to get have a reporting to

560
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,679
the board and talk about board level

561
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
risk and it is a significant pressure

562
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,080
valve to release

563
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
other blockers that you may have

564
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
so when the board says what do you need

565
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,640
also a bit of coaching don't say more

566
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,720
money because then the cfo is going to

567
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,840
take you out back

568
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,240
um talk to them about tone at the top

569
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
say you know hey next time you see the

570
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
ceo ask him when the last time is he met

571
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,880
with the ciso or how often he meets with

572
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
the cso

573
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,960
right

574
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,039
talk about culture of security and you

575
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,039
know meet with the board so

576
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,120
we should have security as a role

577
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
elevated

578
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,159
and then if i were to just dog pile away

579
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
on top of all this would be the seat at

580
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,919
the table as more boards need a security

581
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,880
person in the board

582
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,600
and that's shifting just even get take a

583
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,919
technology leader on boards let alone a

584
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
security leader so that'll my prediction

585
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,080
is you're gonna start hearing more of

586
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
that

587
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
even not even getting the cecil at the

588
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
table but oh my gosh can we get some

589
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,320
security competency in the board and

590
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
i know it's been whispered to pass a

591
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,159
bill i wish they would

592
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
so

593
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
i love listening to mark

594
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,559
talk because he always has very

595
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,760
insightful

596
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,440
comments to make and this and this one

597
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
definitely

598
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
just hits it beautifully i would agree

599
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,520
as well um so i work for a fortune 100

600
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,080
company right we're massive and um you

601
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,840
know spending time with mike roman the

602
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,919
ceo is rare and and not something that

603
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,799
um

604
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,600
you know that that our group or many

605
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,919
groups have an opportunity to do

606
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,320
but but i think that sponsorship is

607
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
important

608
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
but i i feel that equal to that though

609
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,000
and maybe even more so is

610
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,799
also having a partnership with all of

611
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
the main leaders of each of the

612
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
different departments right whether

613
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
that's business cells i.t software

614
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,679
engineering

615
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
is a big one for for space making sure

616
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
that i have a close relationship with

617
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
all of those leaders

618
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,080
because as i'm you know

619
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
convincing the board that we need

620
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
different different kinds of funding

621
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
it's also important to get that buy-in

622
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
from each of those leaders so that way

623
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,000
the program as a whole kind of comes

624
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
back to the business risk and the

625
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
business buying into the things you want

626
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,760
to do

627
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,600
thank you i concede the floor

628
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
thank you

629
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,240
hello

630
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
uh my questions for colin i locked my

631
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,200
keys in my car

632
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,760
[Laughter]

633
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
what kind of key is

634
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
so i'm a vendor

635
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
but i have questions about i talked a

636
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
lot of my customers about

637
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
covet life what that's been like

638
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
and going back to the office just

639
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
interested to hear the panel's thoughts

640
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
on

641
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
remote work compared to being in the

642
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
office

643
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
if productivity is changing if they're

644
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,720
in good or bad being in remote rather is

645
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
in the office or

646
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,600
teamwork and all that stuff and should

647
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,760
hear just thoughts on the panel and

648
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
on that there's nothing that cheers me

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,080
up like a long drive in traffic to work

650
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
that's the tool for my day just right

651
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,440
this uh this topic has so many

652
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,919
you know elements to it right i i'll

653
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,520
start in a positive

654
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,039
uh what's the great part of remote work

655
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,880
i live where i want to live

656
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
right

657
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
and and luckily for a company that you

658
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,880
know helped support that

659
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
um what are the challenges in remote

660
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,720
work i think when it started we thought

661
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
well we'll back in the office in three

662
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,440
months

663
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,039
so

664
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,880
how how thoughtful do we need to be

665
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,200
about our security posture in securing

666
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
our remote workforce in an office versus

667
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
predominantly out of an office

668
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
well that's basically changed

669
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,200
forever

670
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
right and so there's some considerations

671
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
there to make from a remote work

672
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
perspective

673
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
i met with a fairly large group of

674
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
security leaders lately and they're

675
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
if you're a vendor yeah i think you said

676
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
if you're in the vdi market life's

677
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
probably going to get really good here

678
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,320
in the next couple years

679
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,159
because a lot of people are talking

680
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,000
about how do you secure that remote

681
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
workforce you know out in the future

682
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,159
um

683
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,400
for collaboration

684
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
uh

685
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,080
you know you i think honestly you're

686
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,520
kidding yourself if you think you

687
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
collaborate as well from home

688
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,559
as you do in person in the office even

689
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,080
the most

690
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
introverted i don't want to see another

691
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
human being i'm sorry humans are social

692
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
animals

693
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
at some point

694
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,159
you know go talk someone in solitary

695
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
confinement they're not real happy

696
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
you know you're going to have to have

697
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
some in-person collaboration and that

698
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,480
doesn't mean every day but i think that

699
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
finding a balance to your teams as to

700
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,279
what works and finding other ways to

701
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
have social interactions that aren't

702
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,080
purely just work related are are key to

703
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
some balance in that remote work

704
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,120
you know life

705
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,120
i was just going to add to that too that

706
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,559
we did we did a survey um at 3m um to

707
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,320
kind of assess you know people

708
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
satisfaction levels with working from

709
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
home and we found it interesting that i

710
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
mean people who had a family

711
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
at home typically their satisfaction

712
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,919
rate was higher and they were more

713
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,679
interested in staying at home i'm sure

714
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
that doesn't speak to everybody right if

715
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,720
you have little kids that might be a

716
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,760
little harder um but but those who were

717
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
single

718
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,360
um and you know and living without kids

719
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
or a spouse right and just living on

720
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,919
their own

721
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,799
that satisfaction rate was far lower

722
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
um and it kind of opened our eyes to the

723
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
fact that yeah like for i mean and for

724
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
all of us i think mark's right that

725
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
we're humans you know there's some

726
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,559
element that um where we want to

727
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,279
socialize we need to be around people

728
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,039
um and and we have to be mindful of that

729
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
right just because you know some

730
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
employees maybe it works well for them

731
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,799
to work from home but that may not apply

732
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,760
to everybody and i do like the idea that

733
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
you know because i think we're probably

734
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
going to have some level of remote

735
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
regardless i mean we're international

736
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
and most i mean i have employees in

737
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
england and dublin i'm not going to be

738
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,279
able to see them on a daily basis

739
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
regardless even if kovid's not there

740
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,400
that's not going to happen

741
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
but we do need to figure out some ways

742
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,120
to connect um and you know whether it's

743
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,840
events like this or just opportunities

744
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,240
to sometimes just unwind get on video

745
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,400
conference and just chat about life and

746
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
family and just make sure that we have

747
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
constant moments where we're connecting

748
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
as humans instead of feeling like this

749
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,679
work machine

750
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,200
i like that you write up it's not just

751
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
about work

752
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
you communicate to them as humans not

753
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,200
just as co-workers

754
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,520
so my question is asking for advice on

755
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,679
dealing with

756
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,679
my question is dylan is advice on

757
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,000
dealing with impostor syndrome and

758
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
getting on the elevator

759
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
to move to a next stage in my career

760
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
i was thinking about this one all last

761
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
night because i knew this question was

762
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,080
going to come

763
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,960
um

764
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
probably going to

765
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,440
soapbox for just a minute here

766
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,120
first

767
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
please do your research

768
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
if you're thinking about imposter

769
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,520
syndrome

770
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,080
you should look back

771
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
to how that all came about

772
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
so for those of you who don't know

773
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
suzanne ims and pauline clance are the

774
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,559
people who discovered this

775
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,760
and they didn't call it imposter

776
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
syndrome

777
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,799
and what they say about it is they wish

778
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,000
people wouldn't call it imposter

779
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,520
syndrome this is not a disability

780
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,200
but it is something that you will really

781
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
feel and that you can really go through

782
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
it's an experience they call it a

783
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,919
phenomenon

784
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,320
so please understand you're not broken

785
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,240
you're normal

786
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
and you should also understand that

787
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,240
imposter syndrome is different

788
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
than self-doubt impostor syndrome is the

789
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,760
inability to internalize your success

790
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
when someone tells you you did a great

791
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,200
job and you discount that because i was

792
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
just lucky or people haven't figured it

793
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
out yet those kinds of things

794
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
um

795
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
you should certainly deal with the

796
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,120
self-doubt but from an imposter

797
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,799
perspective

798
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,760
once again please get yourself a mentor

799
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
find someone you can trust who can be

800
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,320
that outside advisor to say no you

801
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,960
really did do a good job on this thing

802
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,200
and someone who can say no you really

803
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
didn't do a good job on this thing and

804
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,559
you need to do better someone who can

805
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,640
give you that balanced feedback

806
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
i also think that it's very important

807
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,760
that you understand that that feedback

808
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,159
needs to be able to be used for

809
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,480
your ongoing success understanding that

810
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
you will need to change and when we're

811
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,080
talking about hacking the elevator to

812
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
get up there you're going to have to put

813
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
yourself out there you're going to have

814
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,559
to say

815
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,080
i might fail

816
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
and that's okay

817
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
make sure you have the right kind of

818
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
support system around you if you feel

819
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,520
like you're alone in going to to move

820
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
forward on your career

821
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
that's not okay

822
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
you should have someone who cares about

823
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,679
your career maybe not as much as you do

824
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,080
but a lot if that person can be your

825
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,159
manager at your current job that's

826
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
probably the best scenario

827
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,120
i have a comment or two to say about

828
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,880
that so one of the things that kind of

829
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
helped me i still

830
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
have it or whatever even right now

831
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,279
but

832
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,600
you know signing up for talks like st

833
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
con and local cons were one thing that

834
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
helped me and another thing that just

835
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
came to my mind was we had a we had an

836
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,159
engineer on our team

837
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,679
and when we were interviewing him he

838
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,120
interviewed really well because we said

839
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
hey we want to talk about networking

840
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,840
kind of getting the technical part and

841
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,720
he's like

842
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
uh can you tell us about ip subnetting

843
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
he's like yeah and what he did was he

844
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
said i can t i can do like cider

845
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
notation stuff like this but then he

846
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,000
said but i can't do

847
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
ipv6 subnetting in my head sort of thing

848
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
like so he'll acknowledge his weaknesses

849
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,880
or his strengths right up front and not

850
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,240
try to like fake it till you make it

851
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,679
he'll just say like i don't know that

852
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
and this is why but

853
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,960
i do know this part of it or i'm

854
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
learning this or at home i'm

855
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
you know doing a course on that or

856
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,399
something it's kind of nice because then

857
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,480
they're just up front like shields down

858
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,440
and

859
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
yeah put yourself out there acknowledge

860
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,919
don't focus on

861
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,159
yeah i love that and and if you go back

862
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,480
to the the paper that they wrote um at

863
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
that time i mean they were graduate

864
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,279
students and they were looking around

865
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,520
and noticed that um you know they felt

866
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
that they didn't deserve to be in that

867
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,799
position

868
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,320
right and then they started to realize

869
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
that a lot of the other people who were

870
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
in that same you know school at that you

871
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,559
know ivy league school in a graduate

872
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
program they felt the same way and

873
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,440
that's where they started kind of

874
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
pulling all that together

875
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,240
and some of the things that are that

876
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,960
they recommended um is to you know be

877
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
honest with yourself and really look at

878
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
like the strengths that you have because

879
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
everybody in this room

880
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,720
has amazing strengths um and and i know

881
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
i mean i suffer i i deal with this too

882
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,039
right i have a master's degree

883
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,440
lots of experience but i'll still sit in

884
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
a room in a meeting and i'll think oh

885
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,559
wait do i have enough knowledge to

886
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,159
actually give the opinion that's in my

887
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
mind you know but of course you do speak

888
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
out you know

889
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
and and and likewise be respectful of

890
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,200
other people

891
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
right just you know come to the

892
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
realization that people around you are

893
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
probably dealing with similar similar

894
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
types of situation no one wants to be

895
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
put down no one wants to to feel like

896
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,039
they're less than they are so go out of

897
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,120
your way to lift others up

898
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,440
and and then i think mentorship i love

899
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
that concept because coming back to a

900
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
mentor t you're going to realize that

901
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
they're also trying to figure this out

902
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
that you're not the only one

903
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
um and but definitely you know take a

904
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,799
good look at yourself and and believe in

905
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,080
yourself and look at those strengths

906
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
find someone that you work with

907
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,399
ask them what your superpower is ask

908
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,320
them what you're great at

909
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
i think you'll be surprised at the

910
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,200
amount of things that they could

911
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
probably say about the things that

912
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,600
you're great at that you don't even know

913
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
i would to go another thing i would say

914
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,519
is my wife and i talk about this a lot

915
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
a lot of imposter syndrome is because

916
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,200
you compare your blooper reel to their

917
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,799
highlight reel

918
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,960
i know everything i screwed up on last

919
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,360
week i don't know everything seth

920
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,519
screwed up on last week but i see seth

921
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,960
goodness awesome presentation

922
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
and i come back here and i'm like man i

923
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
didn't give any awesome presentations

924
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
last week

925
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
so make sure that if you're doing these

926
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,399
comparisons

927
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,480
actually just don't do comparisons

928
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,720
that's the real answer but when you do

929
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,240
make sure that you're comparing blooper

930
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
for blooper and highlight for highlight

931
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,039
because

932
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,039
it's really easy to get that i'm not

933
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,480
good enough and

934
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,399
another thing i would say is find a hero

935
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,440
and meet him

936
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,279
um

937
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,559
i can pick on him because he's not here

938
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,480
at least i don't see him troy is an

939
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
awesome person and he does a boatload

940
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,519
for this con

941
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,039
a lot of people are like oh troy is a

942
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,240
smartest infosec person he's not

943
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,039
and he'll tell you that i'm serious

944
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,399
meet your hero and talk to him and

945
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,919
realize that you are building these

946
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
people up and you are just as smart as a

947
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
lot of these people that you are like

948
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,640
man i am just not in their class

949
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
and as you get to know them it kind of

950
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,320
is a reality check for you

951
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
colin talked about go out and give

952
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,840
presentations maybe you're not ready for

953
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
a sink on stage so find your local

954
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,080
hacker group or find a local special

955
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,519
interest group and present their

956
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,519
security interest group present there

957
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,440
to five or ten people

958
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,360
and you'll get the feedback that seth's

959
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,960
talking about a mentor is important too

960
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,559
but if you don't have a mentor there are

961
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,840
other places to get some of this

962
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,000
feedback in some of this even like lunch

963
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,600
and learns or like do a company brown

964
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,159
bag like hey let's talk about something

965
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,000
that interests me like even that is a

966
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,840
great start

967
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,000
we will we'll get i just gotta give one

968
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,519
we'll probably get on this one that

969
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,120
self-doubt comment i'll just give you

970
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
one tool i've always used there was a

971
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,080
guy i went to high school with oh my

972
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
gosh

973
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,679
like what a mess

974
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,159
he's a general surgeon now

975
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,240
and i always think regardless of what's

976
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,039
in my life and i'll make up a name if

977
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,240
bill

978
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
is a general surgeon like in that

979
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,840
self-doubt i'm like

980
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,320
i'm pretty sure there's a path

981
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,840
to get to anything and i shared that

982
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
with my daughter the other day is 14 and

983
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,320
we were very remote placed i said here

984
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,559
let's let's see you drive the car

985
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,480
i can't drive the car i said let me tell

986
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
you about this guy bill i went to high

987
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,279
school with

988
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,799
right

989
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
so

990
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
all good well a little comparison is

991
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,159
probably wrong but i use that one quite

992
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,960
a bit

993
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,720
doctors still call it a practice just

994
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
does that answer your question are you

995
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,639
good with that dude

996
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
mostly i see it all the imposter

997
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
syndrome coming a lot from my colleagues

998
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,280
and i'm like

999
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,679
it's really getting on the elevator was

1000
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,359
worth the question for me

1001
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,760
yeah and the bottom line is it's real it

1002
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,679
happens to everyone and it's how do you

1003
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,199
deal with it and how do you use it to

1004
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,280
drive you forward because that

1005
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,599
uncertainty is is hunger for improvement

1006
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,239
and growth honestly and so

1007
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
recognize that it's like said it's not a

1008
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,879
sign of being broken but it's drive to

1009
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,440
an opportunity to improve and

1010
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
use the tool correctly and balance it

1011
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,399
with your mental health as needed

1012
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,118
thank you that was a great question

1013
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
um what if i'm bill and i can't find my

1014
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
path

1015
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,079
no my real question is um

1016
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,560
luckily his dad was also a doctor so i

1017
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
think he got some i think he had a tutor

1018
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,800
is my that's how i'm guessing it

1019
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,079
happened

1020
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,760
mentor there you go he had a mentor

1021
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,119
mentorship

1022
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
that mentorship actually brings me into

1023
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
my real question so i mentor a lot of

1024
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,839
students trying to get into cyber

1025
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,839
security and in the past i've always

1026
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,599
told them that they needed to socially

1027
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,280
engineer themselves a job right they

1028
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
need to make the connections and do the

1029
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,520
work to you know present in an interview

1030
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,599
or something

1031
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
but you know over the past two years

1032
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
things have changed and it's harder to

1033
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
make those connections

1034
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,440
aside from cold connecting on linkedin

1035
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,760
how do you guys or how would you suggest

1036
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,200
you know making connections and meeting

1037
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
new people to get because

1038
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
i've had a hard time getting through hr

1039
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
filters but whenever i talk to somebody

1040
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
in the company i tend to do pretty well

1041
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,839
and secure jobs that way

1042
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,680
it's harder to do that nowadays with

1043
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,640
less meetups and in-person events

1044
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
everything seems to be on linkedin right

1045
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,040
now

1046
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
linkedin's i mean yeah it is but there's

1047
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,079
a tactic of linkedin unless you're

1048
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,640
looking for seth

1049
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,359
if you're looking for anybody else

1050
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,200
looking for alumni

1051
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,560
that are in the field that you're

1052
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
looking for and out of a school that

1053
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,240
you're going to even if they're not

1054
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
local or not there's very rarely someone

1055
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,520
that when you give an intro like hey

1056
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
i saw you went to

1057
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,599
university of utah or

1058
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,480
uvsa or byu or whatever i'm getting

1059
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,240
ready to graduate

1060
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,680
like

1061
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,280
again there's very few people that won't

1062
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
respond to that even on a linkedin cold

1063
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,800
call

1064
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,079
so my last job in school i needed like a

1065
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,480
a half a year or two semesters or

1066
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
something

1067
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
between my internship and when i was

1068
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,160
going to graduate

1069
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
and i wanted to work security i had done

1070
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
a software engineering internship i had

1071
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,920
engineering like software engineering

1072
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
experience but i didn't have any like

1073
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,320
security experience at that point at all

1074
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,599
and so i wanted to do something

1075
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,599
something anything in the infosec field

1076
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,240
so i i was in logan so i don't know if

1077
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,960
anybody's familiar with sdl it's a

1078
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,359
big company up there non-profit that

1079
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,040
that does stuff for the government and

1080
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,359
uh i was like they might have security

1081
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,040
jobs maybe like i didn't see any

1082
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,280
listings and i know they previously

1083
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
posted some security positions at some

1084
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
point or other

1085
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
and so i was like okay who do i know

1086
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,200
that works there

1087
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,680
nobody personally great um

1088
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
so i emailed

1089
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
one of my professors who i knew had

1090
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,079
worked there

1091
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,960
and he taught part-time and asked him if

1092
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
he knew anybody that worked there that

1093
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
was looking for people in security and

1094
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,920
so he sent me some contact information i

1095
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,119
called the guy

1096
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,160
told him my interests and i had a job

1097
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
um

1098
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
so even if you don't know somebody super

1099
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
well at a company or just have a like a

1100
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,040
tiny connection you can ask

1101
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
them to give you a reference to somebody

1102
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,680
else

1103
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,640
and just kind of work that way

1104
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,000
can i do a quick success in failure i

1105
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,680
wouldn't say social engineer your way

1106
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,320
into it so i worked at a large religious

1107
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
non-profit based in salt lake do the

1108
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,119
math

1109
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
and i wanted to get over on the red team

1110
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
and i saw the hiring manager because i

1111
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,640
was an employee and i was like i wanted

1112
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
to apply for that so i just threw him an

1113
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,760
email and said hey i'd like to go over

1114
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
some resumes can i meet some time he's

1115
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,960
like yeah throw a half an hour on my

1116
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,640
calendar we'll come talk and i started

1117
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,920
talking i showed him my resume and i

1118
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
started talking and everything's like

1119
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,680
you're not from hr going over resumes

1120
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,960
like no i'm actually interested he's

1121
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,079
like

1122
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,359
okay

1123
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,119
well you got 27 minutes what do you know

1124
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
and

1125
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
that didn't work out so i was like cool

1126
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
cool that that that's fun but then a

1127
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
success story i applied to my current

1128
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,160
company pluralsight and it's like i

1129
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,599
wonder who's on the security team there

1130
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
so i looked him up and i i call this

1131
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
ocean because i was looking up people

1132
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
who worked there and did securing

1133
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
everything and it's like hey

1134
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
there maybe they'll be at this hack west

1135
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,320
conference that we're gonna be at so

1136
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,480
hallway con networking is a good way but

1137
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,240
i know what they look like and i bumped

1138
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,280
into them

1139
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,520
that's a more subtle social injury and

1140
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
it worked i guess because they hired me

1141
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,119
but yeah

1142
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,320
yeah

1143
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
see so you would suggest using a tool

1144
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,560
like the harvester to

1145
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
oh absolutely awesome

1146
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,320
i would just add to the

1147
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,640
your part of your question talked about

1148
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
groups that are harder to get going and

1149
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,839
harder with covid

1150
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,599
don't be afraid to start your own group

1151
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
like as i sit here i see several dc 435

1152
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,000
hats

1153
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
two of them up here honestly it didn't

1154
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
exist a year and a half ago two years

1155
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,800
ago

1156
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,720
james pope moved to logan and he said

1157
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
hey i want to do that and it was me and

1158
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,079
james and his brother john and like one

1159
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,160
other person sitting there and said hey

1160
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
let's do this and we said okay here are

1161
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,520
four other people i know that would be

1162
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,440
interested and we got six or seven of us

1163
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,240
together at pope tech and we sat down at

1164
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,560
the av company um we sat down and we

1165
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
mapped out when do we want to meet what

1166
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
we want to do and we made a plan and we

1167
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,560
got it going and it took

1168
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,359
like three weeks to go from an idea to

1169
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,359
we're meeting next week and

1170
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,880
don't be afraid to start your own if

1171
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
there's not a small group around you

1172
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,280
like it it it is doable it doesn't take

1173
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
financial resources it doesn't take

1174
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,200
it does take a few connections and you

1175
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,720
do need some you need to put in some

1176
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,319
work but it's doable for you to put in a

1177
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,400
small group around you

1178
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
have you met someone new while you're

1179
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
here

1180
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,280
and not just for you everybody here

1181
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,760
right if if you want to do networking

1182
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,599
just look in this room and think for

1183
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,800
just a moment

1184
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,119
about the opportunities and security

1185
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,920
talent that we have in this room

1186
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
there's likely someone who could be a

1187
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,720
mentor or the avenue to your next job

1188
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,960
if i can tell a story about that who in

1189
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
here everybody i'm gonna out him because

1190
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,960
he's not in here kevin howard

1191
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,319
um

1192
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,200
he

1193
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
was a couple he's he's a few years

1194
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
behind me in the career when we first

1195
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,760
went to st conn like in 2011

1196
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,200
they put him on the committee and i was

1197
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
like why'd they put him there he's like

1198
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
two years younger than me he's like two

1199
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
years less experienced than me why kevin

1200
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,720
and at first i was pissed and i decided

1201
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,000
i started

1202
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,760
i decided instead of being pissed i

1203
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
would talk to him

1204
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,760
and when i decided to pivot my career 15

1205
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
years later

1206
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
kevin is who went to his boss and said

1207
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,280
hey make a job for this guy we don't

1208
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,880
have one but open one

1209
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
find the guy next to you you never know

1210
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,760
when it's going to pay off or how it's

1211
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,319
going to pay off but find people it was

1212
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,240
a st con connection that got me where i

1213
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
am today

1214
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,000
once again i'm hiring

1215
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,800
[Laughter]

1216
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,480
just throwing that out there yeah if you

1217
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
want an entry to the elevator sherry is

1218
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,040
here she will hold the door for you hers

1219
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
is the fast elevator it's a good one to

1220
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
be on

1221
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
the great glass elevator

1222
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,839
okay this hopefully is a well-formed

1223
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,520
question been thinking about it

1224
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
for those of us looking at the career

1225
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,359
eliminator and seeing it go through the

1226
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,960
management track

1227
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,480
how do you navigate that especially if

1228
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
we're not terribly interested in it

1229
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,839
just context

1230
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,599
the last year i've been working a job

1231
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,680
has turned into a paper job where i'm

1232
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
dealing with

1233
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,359
reports and policy and people and i

1234
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,680
haven't touched a compiler or an ide in

1235
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,480
11 months and so it's it's been less

1236
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
fulfilling than i thought it would be

1237
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,800
how do we navigate what are your

1238
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
thoughts on navigating are you seeing

1239
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,160
how do you maintain technical skills in

1240
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,760
management or how do you avoid

1241
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,240
management and stay technical or both

1242
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,760
maybe if you could talk on both but more

1243
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
the latter than the former here i can i

1244
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,560
can touch on the first one right so um i

1245
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,119
mean i've been in management since i was

1246
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,319
19 right i mean i did a lot of messing

1247
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,240
around before that and and so this is

1248
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,160
something i've constantly been trying to

1249
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,319
add in over and over again because i'm i

1250
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,920
love being a part of engineering that's

1251
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,520
kind of at the the core of who i'm at

1252
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,640
who i am

1253
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,560
um so i created my own pen testing

1254
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,319
company right i was in a management

1255
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,400
position and i thought like i

1256
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,480
i don't get to do pen testing like you

1257
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,839
know like i wish i could do i don't get

1258
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,760
to get in the weeds anymore so i just

1259
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
created my own company on the side and i

1260
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
started doing pen testing and little by

1261
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,720
little i started picking up some big

1262
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,760
clients and and that was my way

1263
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,960
of going from non-stop meetings all day

1264
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
and then at night and on weekends i'd

1265
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,560
get to do some pen testing engagements

1266
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,240
and dive in and have some fun

1267
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,839
i would say

1268
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,319
you need to decide what you want right

1269
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,560
and i would say that leadership and

1270
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,319
management is a different skill and a

1271
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,480
different career track in general for

1272
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
most people

1273
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,599
not all people who are great technical

1274
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,440
people are great leaders and not all

1275
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,720
people who are great leaders are great

1276
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,240
technical people if you get someone who

1277
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,160
can do both they tend to be highly

1278
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,480
valuable like sherry i mean i'm sure

1279
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,240
that her company really values that she

1280
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,760
has that capacity she had a talk

1281
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,599
yesterday where she was diving

1282
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,520
incredibly deep into something so that's

1283
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,720
an a benefit that could be there for you

1284
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,599
and

1285
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,680
i would also say if you've been a paper

1286
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
pusher for 11 months

1287
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,160
can you change that who says you can

1288
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,839
that you have to do it that way if

1289
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,440
you're a leader in your company are you

1290
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,200
empowered to make that kind of a change

1291
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,400
it's possible that you can make

1292
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,079
something different for you and maybe

1293
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,359
for others to make that better

1294
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,760
you have any follow-up questions you

1295
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,040
want to

1296
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,400
no

1297
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,359
does that answer your question

1298
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,440
hey guys uh i am

1299
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,880
currently a

1300
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,240
uh graveshift employee so i don't get a

1301
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,680
lot of

1302
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,839
interaction with people i also work for

1303
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,800
troy

1304
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,200
and uen so

1305
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,520
our day shift does a really great job of

1306
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
making me not have anything to do at

1307
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
night

1308
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,920
so my question to you

1309
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,440
is uh you know i'd kind of like to find

1310
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,640
uh it position that's not sales

1311
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,440
or like customer phone service

1312
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,520
that has a lot of people interaction

1313
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,000
because i'm a people person and i i like

1314
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,200
that and that's

1315
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,640
kind of what i'm looking at you know

1316
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
going on like maybe education or

1317
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,319
something like that what kind of

1318
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,440
positions

1319
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
would you

1320
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,560
think of as being really good for

1321
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
somebody who likes a lot of people

1322
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,119
interaction

1323
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,880
and how to get into those

1324
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,560
people interaction

1325
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,400
um

1326
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,839
i mean i can think of a few things i

1327
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,000
think one is aligning them to your

1328
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
interest right and and so part of that

1329
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
is you say well i don't want to be in

1330
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,880
sales i know there's a lot of great uh

1331
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,599
solution engineers that one sales has

1332
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,760
completed their work they come out you

1333
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,599
know customer success

1334
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,760
relationship and that's all they do is

1335
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,680
work with the client to be successful

1336
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,160
with their customer in implementing the

1337
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,520
technology

1338
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,599
you know whatever it may be you know

1339
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,000
from that perspective

1340
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,760
i think also looking at you know

1341
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
companies like seth mentioned he's he's

1342
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,040
a advisor with aws i mean look at

1343
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,599
company values they they serve on

1344
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,480
customer obsession as like a core value

1345
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,440
right so someone that is looking for a

1346
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,920
customer i mean i can relate to you when

1347
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,480
i was going through school i i hit a

1348
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,000
point i was signed up for a ton of

1349
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,160
computer science classes

1350
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,760
and i said i really wish there was

1351
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,359
something more people interaction maybe

1352
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,960
like a cross between like business and

1353
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,880
computer science and someone's like you

1354
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
mean information systems

1355
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,040
oh what's that and then i changed my

1356
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,800
whole schedule because i didn't want to

1357
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,760
be

1358
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,160
just tucked away without that that human

1359
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,400
interaction

1360
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,240
assurance work it's technical and i t so

1361
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,520
i t auditors compliance it's not the

1362
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,160
hands-on delivery side but it gets you

1363
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,319
close to technology and it's all people

1364
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,680
interaction

1365
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,560
right so a few ideas

1366
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,040
yeah i mean security positions a large

1367
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,960
number of them actually deal with just

1368
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,040
working with people right i mean i have

1369
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,560
engineering positions where they you

1370
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,359
know vulnerability management engineers

1371
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,119
where you know you know yes they're

1372
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,240
running some tools and they're doing

1373
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,040
scans but a lot of their work is just

1374
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
communicating with managers and

1375
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,440
developers and helping them understand

1376
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,960
why that's a vulnerability what that

1377
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,359
looks like and it's just communication

1378
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,960
and then you look at all the other types

1379
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,960
of positions like compliance

1380
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,520
risk risk involves a lot of people

1381
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,000
skills so being able to combine those

1382
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,720
two is very valuable privacy is another

1383
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,880
field that we often forget about when we

1384
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,960
talk about security but it's all about

1385
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,359
protecting people's privacy so it's very

1386
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,720
people driven

1387
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,960
so having interest in that is it

1388
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,800
partners beautifully with cyber security

1389
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,079
it really does

1390
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,680
i would say get involved here with

1391
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,440
people before the conference ends ask

1392
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,119
them about their job and how much they

1393
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,720
interact with people

1394
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,960
matt was talking about uh some of the

1395
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,280
like groups that you can join as a

1396
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,880
community effort

1397
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
talk with people about their

1398
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,400
interactions with people and see if you

1399
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,079
can find the job that fits you the best

1400
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,000
if you can find someone who does that

1401
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,760
you can find probably a great in for

1402
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,680
your next job and a mentor at the same

1403
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,919
time

1404
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,240
thank you

1405
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,319
hi uh just a question about um

1406
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,839
from a managerial uh like a team lead or

1407
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,240
employer or um

1408
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,520
or any of

1409
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,920
of the like uh what kind of things would

1410
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,160
you look for in a

1411
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,599
in a future employee or in a

1412
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,400
promotion for a current employee

1413
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,319
to be a manager

1414
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,960
or just as an individual contributor

1415
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,440
to yeah to be part of the team or um

1416
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,079
okay or to be employed yeah motivation

1417
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,559
motivation motivation

1418
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,400
passion yeah

1419
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,640
yeah passion definitely i mean i look to

1420
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,040
that and i'll even tell you i'll pull in

1421
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,800
i'll bring in my engineers when we're

1422
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,720
interviewing somebody and and one of the

1423
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
things i'll tell them is

1424
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,599
and they know this just because they

1425
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,599
know the culture of our team right that

1426
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,680
that what we want in a person you know

1427
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,280
that we bring on board is someone who's

1428
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,640
very motivated

1429
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
right i mean i can i can teach you

1430
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
technology i can teach you technical

1431
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,680
things if as long as you're motivated

1432
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,839
and you have a strong desire to learn i

1433
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,359
can teach you that

1434
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,359
but it's really hard to ingrain in

1435
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,680
somebody you know motivation and desire

1436
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,160
and passion those are things that yeah i

1437
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,319
i can't give you that you have to come

1438
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,720
with that to me

1439
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,040
you hear a lot i mean it goes off that

1440
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
hungry humble and smart

1441
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,960
attributes i mean they kind of touch to

1442
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,520
each of those so one if one of those

1443
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,839
gets out of balance that's not a good

1444
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,520
fit if you want to read about this in a

1445
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,359
narrative read a book called the ideal

1446
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,800
team player

1447
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
right and and it also wraps around so

1448
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,599
like that hungry is that motivation

1449
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,280
humble you know maybe you've also heard

1450
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,680
that is like no brilliant jerks no one

1451
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,000
will be on my team that's a like a jerk

1452
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,480
or you know is is not going to be

1453
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,720
collaborative and then that hungry and

1454
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,200
that motivation right and so i often

1455
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,559
will say we're looking at someone as

1456
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,839
like

1457
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,200
they don't have to have it but do they

1458
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,160
have an aptitude to learn it right and

1459
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,800
and

1460
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
then we can teach it and we can go

1461
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,760
forward

1462
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,359
and i would say if you're looking for a

1463
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,839
promotion

1464
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,440
if you can and i would encourage you to

1465
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,119
find out if you can because it will say

1466
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,400
a lot about the organization you work

1467
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,640
for talk with your manager about what it

1468
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,240
looks like to get promoted what do you

1469
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,640
need to do to get there and set some

1470
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,640
goals together if you can get your

1471
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,720
manager on board with those goals and

1472
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,040
helping you to create those goals then

1473
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
your likelihood for success and that

1474
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,200
promotion coming forward is probably

1475
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,160
significantly higher

1476
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,760
i'm going to follow this up with a

1477
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,839
question for seth manessi i'm going to

1478
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,359
put you on the spot

1479
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,680
what did you do which one yeah what did

1480
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,319
you do to highlight what to highlight

1481
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,119
this

1482
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,800
in your experience recently applying for

1483
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,760
a job yeah so um

1484
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,000
extracurricular things

1485
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,520
if you're just graduating college and

1486
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,640
you're looking to get noticed by

1487
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
employers the last thing that's going to

1488
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,960
get you noticed is

1489
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,079
stuff everybody else has done in college

1490
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,760
you need other things so matt noticed me

1491
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,240
potentially because i tried to stalk him

1492
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,680
at the local defcon group that he was

1493
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,359
talking about earlier

1494
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,200
um i don't think you even knew that like

1495
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,800
i went to try and find you because

1496
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,720
you're the hiring manager for the job

1497
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,559
that i was applying for

1498
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,280
and i knew you're and i got the job

1499
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,960
because i could talk to him about it in

1500
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,440
my interview um

1501
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,880
also i

1502
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,440
uh i did i did competitions in college

1503
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,359
relating to fields that i was interested

1504
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,319
in

1505
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,480
b-sides had a like an application

1506
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,400
security competition or something that i

1507
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,880
did very well with and there was a cyber

1508
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,720
force competition put on by the

1509
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,319
department of energy that i participated

1510
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,760
in for a couple years and did well with

1511
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,480
those and so being able to list okay

1512
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,079
i did these things

1513
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,480
in addition to just my normal college

1514
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,680
work

1515
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,440
is super helpful

1516
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,040
and when you graduated did you start at

1517
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,359
the bottom of the totem pole

1518
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,480
no

1519
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,160
so it works it does

1520
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,960
just one quick caveat to that

1521
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,079
there is a difference between

1522
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,520
extracurricular activities and

1523
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,160
extracurricular activities that are

1524
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,680
relevant

1525
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,839
if you have on your resume for a cyber

1526
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,480
security job that you're a beekeeper

1527
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,079
that's not really helpful i don't know

1528
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,400
what you think but it's not helpful to

1529
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,440
me if you say i'm engaged in my local dc

1530
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,760
435 or 801 group

1531
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,319
that's relevant right so understanding

1532
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,440
and

1533
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,720
there probably could be like a million

1534
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,559
things said about resumes or the

1535
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,680
approach but

1536
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
understand that hiring managers are

1537
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,440
often very busy

1538
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,280
you want to be able to present to them

1539
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,040
the what's in it for them

1540
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,119
as quickly as you can if you can find

1541
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,960
the kinds of things extracurricular i'm

1542
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,480
working with open source i'm working

1543
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,559
with my community i did this special

1544
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,520
project in school and you can share that

1545
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
that will be very helpful just like you

1546
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,400
said

1547
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
i have bees

1548
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,599
yeah tell me that you used an arduino to

1549
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,079
monitor like the activity of your bees

1550
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,119
and the amount of honey that they're

1551
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,480
making yeah

1552
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,440
then then let's talk

1553
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,200
okay does that answer your question

1554
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,119
yes thank you okay we're running low on

1555
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,880
time so we'll get this one in and then

1556
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,400
yeah john do you have one too we're

1557
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,640
gonna have one last question but uh i

1558
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
encourage you to come up

1559
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,280
to them after they're done uh you can

1560
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,680
probably find them after they're done

1561
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,960
and uh interact with them then

1562
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,400
okay um

1563
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,000
i guess the pared down version of my

1564
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,240
question is the the first half of my

1565
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,520
technical career was in like field work

1566
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,040
and then for various quality of life

1567
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,559
reasons i started looking for something

1568
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,599
else

1569
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,839
what is your advice to older people

1570
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,880
about how to make previous incarnations

1571
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,880
a little more relative or relevant

1572
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,839
rather when they're when they're

1573
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,000
applying for things can you clarify what

1574
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
you mean by field work i worked in oil

1575
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,480
field telemetry and hardware

1576
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,599
and it was pretty intense and i got into

1577
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,119
cyber security while recovering from a

1578
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,640
workplace injury

1579
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,960
i'll put it that way

1580
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
but

1581
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,359
yeah as someone going for a career

1582
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,040
change at exactly double the drinking

1583
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
age

1584
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,960
i can i can say that the answer that

1585
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,040
seth gave just a minute ago directly

1586
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,640
applies

1587
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,960
show that the way i often say this is

1588
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,640
show that you care about this by the

1589
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,640
time you put in if you are passionate

1590
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,079
about cyber security it's not a i took a

1591
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,480
class on cyber security it's a

1592
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,559
i took my own time my own money my own

1593
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,480
initiative my own resources and at home

1594
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,040
i built this lab with to learn how to

1595
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,359
run cerakata i wanted to learn more

1596
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,759
about

1597
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,839
red teaming and so i've been working on

1598
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,680
hacking the box i've been working on

1599
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,960
whatever the challenge is that you're

1600
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
doing show things that you're doing i

1601
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,720
think that the career pivot is very

1602
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,640
similar to the college transition of a

1603
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,799
new um person but

1604
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,400
for others for more comments on that but

1605
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,839
i i would say

1606
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,680
unless you can show

1607
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,319
relevant translatable skills you might

1608
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,400
be starting back in that area that that

1609
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,160
matt's talking about

1610
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,559
but i would also encourage you to

1611
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,480
take a look at the job that you want and

1612
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,079
try and figure out how do the things

1613
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,160
that i've done in the past plug into

1614
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,599
that right if you've been out in oil

1615
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,000
fields working with radio technology you

1616
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,280
probably had to do some sort of

1617
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,960
encryption back and forth on those kinds

1618
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,040
of things dig into that a little deeper

1619
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,559
and find a way to make it relevant if

1620
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,200
you can

1621
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,280
even general skills help like meeting

1622
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,520
deadlines and project managing and stuff

1623
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,359
like that it translates all over

1624
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,440
okay well

1625
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,880
we appreciate your time here i hope this

1626
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,240

this idea was pitched and i loved the

1632
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,720
idea and said let's make it happen
