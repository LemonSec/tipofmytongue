1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
welcome to my talk about the sync con

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,400
2021 network

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,399
how to build a conference network or at

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
least how we built this one

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
my name is tristan rhodes

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,440
we're going to talk about how we built

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,559
the network

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
photos of said network and then a little

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,199
bit about how this network has been used

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,199
and how it compares two years ago when

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,720
we were here

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,920
for sync on 2019.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
this picture actually is the conference

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
room where all the committee members

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
meet up to kind of run the network it's

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,200
kind of the

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
central station

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
and we have uh an example of the network

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,960
here we've provided a

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,719
switch and then a wireless ap for the

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,640
committee just so that

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,000
if things go really bad we still have

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
network access it's

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,879
always good to have a backup plan

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,239
so i work for weber state the network

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
architect

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
i have a wife three kids a dog and a

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
tesla which some might consider part of

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
the family

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
i play trumpet

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,560
and i

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
my pen my pandemic

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
hobby i picked up game development so

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
i've been doing that about a year

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
and that's a lot of fun for me

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
um i actually used my skills to create

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,520
three of the puzzles in the hackers

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,560
challenge

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
so if you're i think the category is

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
some fun so hopefully you have some fun

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
while you play those they're easy to

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
moderate so if you're looking for

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
something fun to do

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
and get some points on hacker challenge

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
i recommend trying those

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
and i love sync on

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
um i wanted to find out how many of you

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
this is your first time at sanecon

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,200
wow

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
how about half of you guys

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,439
and how many of you do networking as uh

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
for your day job

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
that makes sense for this talk

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,840
most of you uh how many work for the

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
government or education

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
that's almost everyone and then private

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,960
industry

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
oh that's not bad maybe a third

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,560
that's that's good that's a good mix

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
originally sincon was all just like

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,840
education and uh based and so it's great

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,039
to see more people coming in

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
so our we have a couple sponsors that

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
have made this network possible

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
centracom provides our internets they

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
give us a one gigabit dedicated link

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
just for us

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
and 30 ips public ipv4s and they've been

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
sponsoring since 2019

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,920
and they actually leave the circuit

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
active year round

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
and so you'll be able to get the eduroam

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
service

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
anybody who's coming to a

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
an event here at the conference center

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,160
will have access to eduroam

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
which is a wireless ssid that

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
is shared throughout the world

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
if you don't know what it is i recommend

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
looking up what eduroam

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,400
so the equipment sponsor is this year is

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
a cisco meraki

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
and they've been a sponsor for many many

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
years a great sponsor because they

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
provide our switches firewalls wireless

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,359
aps and

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
for the past two conferences cameras so

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
we use cameras for

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
theft prevention

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
and someone actually just used it to

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
find out if they were holding something

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
when they walked out of a room

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,680
you know like i know i had it at noon

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
and now i don't have it was i holding it

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,680
and so like things like that are

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,159
sometimes useful use of of cameras

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
so what was different about this year

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
uh you guys probably know about this

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
already

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
supply chain problems prevent

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
they greatly delay getting equipment in

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
and

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
additionally

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
some companies have reduced their

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
sponsoring budget for in-person events

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,319
like this

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,799
and so cisco was unable to give us

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,239
everything we asked for previous years

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,319
they just they were very

110
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
able to provide whatever we asked for

111
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,080
this year they said we can't give you

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
what you asked for but we will give you

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
what you need and so they helped us

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
piece together a solution that did

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
provide meet our needs

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
and so

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
we requested to use all meraki

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
again like we did in 2019.

119
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
meraki

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,478
is very uh quick and easy to get started

121
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
and and provides great visibility

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
uh that's why i like using for

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,000
conferences

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
but

125
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
for my day job i use

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,199
non

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,840
i use cisco non-meraki

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
so i also have that skill set so that's

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
what we were kind of a hybrid this year

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
and the requirements for this conference

131
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,680
we have about 1200 people here

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
this year i guess it's about 1100

133
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,240
but everybody brings multiple devices

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
i

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
personally have a watch phone and laptop

136
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,320
and

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,759
i'm sure some of you have similar things

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,520
or more

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
there's three huge floors

140
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
and five network closets connected with

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,120
single mode

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,479
fiber optic cables that's what we use to

143
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
connect the closets

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
the converse has pretty decent

145
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,120
wiring

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
so pretty much every

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
50 to

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
75 feet there's going to be a wired

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
port in the floor or the wall

150
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
we also need a dedicated

151
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,880
internet connection because we do

152
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
custom

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
rules on

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,680
what we allow in and out

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
we also

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
have some servers that are hosted

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
here and we need to have inbound nat

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
translations

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
and we didn't want to have to negotiate

160
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,360
that and coordinate that through a third

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
party

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
like for instance the conference center

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
and we also wanted to make sure we were

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
protecting the conference center from

165
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
sync on because as you know parts of st

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
con involve hacking that's how we learn

167
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,919
and we don't want the conference center

168
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,759
to accidentally get you know attacked by

169
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
people who are learning how to hack

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,039
and

171
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,520
yeah so some parts of the network can

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
hacking is allowed in some parts we want

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
to protect so that's why we need that

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
control

175
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
so far

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
our design choices at layer 2

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
this is the same we've done for several

178
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,240
years but

179
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
uvcc

180
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,600
made a great investment in wireless

181
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
access points they have over 50 wi-fi

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
five access points and a lot of them

183
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,360
have um antennas that kind of shoot down

184
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
into a small cell of

185
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
coverage and that's what you want in a

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,120
dense environment like this you don't

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
want to put up omnidirectional antenna

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
and c5 500 devices you just want to just

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
kind of have these segmented zones where

190
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
you can

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,199
have uh it's less noisy for the ap to

192
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
handle

193
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,520
so that so we use their aps for for

194
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
layer 2

195
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
and then

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
like i said uh previous cons like four

197
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
plus years ago we actually did bring the

198
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
aps here

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,240
because there was only a way to get that

200
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
much coverage but now we use the the

201
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
conference centers

202
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
wireless

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
there is a downside we did have to

204
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
coordinate all of our changes

205
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,080
so the eduroam and the saintcon ssid we

206
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
had to coordinate that with them and

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,800
they were very good to work with us on

208
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
you know changing the password and

209
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
verifying things are working

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
for our wired network the switching is

211
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
done through catalyst uh cisco catalyst

212
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,319
9200's

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
and that's a switch that has uh gigabit

214
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
ports poe

215
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
and fiber uplinks basically what we need

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
so there are three is um provided by the

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,919
meraki mx

218
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,880
it's a it's a default gateway

219
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
um for all the users it provides dhcp

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,199
service

221
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
it does nat translations and firewall

222
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,400
rules and it also has a client vpn which

223
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
was really only used by the

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
the admins of the network so we could

225
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,440
manage this

226
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
the equipment here using um

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
from hotels for instance

228
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,840
and the meraki equipment could be

229
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
managed really from anywhere anyways

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
because that's a cloud managed system

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
but the cisco equipment that we had

232
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
was you know requires local management

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
access so that's what that was used for

234
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,639
and one tip we learned this is a lesson

235
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,080
lesson learned from a previous

236
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
conference we set the dhcp leases to one

237
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
week

238
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
so that we never have to worry about a

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
dhcp service problem

240
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,639
for the for the rest of the conference

241
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
that's not exactly true because when

242
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,440
people

243
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
connect and disconnect on wireless but

244
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,199
we tried to reduce that as much as

245
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
possible

246
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
we had one conference where

247
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
the dhcp server

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,559
was just you know standard one hour

249
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,399
lease times or whatever

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
and when

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,880
when everybody showed up i think was the

252
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
second day

253
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,839
we had a

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
rate limit on dhcp on the switch port

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
which was kind of unfortunate it

256
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
shouldn't have been there but that rate

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
limiting shut the port down because they

258
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
thought it was a dhcp like a rogue dcp

259
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
server

260
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
but we addressed that

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
now with

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
dcp snooping if you guys don't know what

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
that is dcp snooping is a great security

264
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
feature that basically blocks all dhcp

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
except for trusted ports it's very

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
critical because if you are using dhcp

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
in your institution

268
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,959
if somebody hosts a dhb server

269
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,080
they can now

270
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
redirect all users through them and it's

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
like a man in the middle

272
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,760
so

273
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
okay so this is probably too small for

274
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
you to see but i can talk about the

275
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
colors so the uh

276
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
the green color is the uh uvcc wireless

277
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
and they have a layer two vlan over to

278
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
our meraki firewalls which we have two

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
of

280
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
for redundancy it's an active passive

281
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,399
redundancy and then we've got two

282
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
switches

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
that are basically the fiber aggregation

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
switches and those talk to each of those

285
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
clauses i talked about through single

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
signal fiber and of course we do two

287
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,640
links so that we can have a link failure

288
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,640
what else okay so blue is basically

289
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,560
the 90 cisco 9200 switching

290
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
and then the purple

291
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
um cisco gave us

292
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
five um

293
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
wireless aps that we use for special

294
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
purposes and i'll talk about that a

295
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
little bit but they're not the primary

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
they're not the primarily primary

297
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,480
wireless but they provide special

298
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
unique things

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
and then the yellow is the are the

300
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
cameras that we have throughout the camp

301
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
throughout the

302
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,760
conference go ahead

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
so you're saying can we install the

304
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
wireday piece on

305
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
in the conference center

306
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
yeah

307
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,239
the what's the question

308
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,079
so we actually only brought about five

309
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,079
yeah yeah

310
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,120
so

311
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
um i don't know if i talked about they

312
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
have about 50

313
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
access points already installed so i

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,560
think i do talk about later let's see

315
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
no worries

316
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
actually this is yeah

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
so they have like 50 of the cisco 3802s

318
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
so that's the wi-fi five generation

319
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
still great access point

320
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
and then we brought in five of the wi-fi

321
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,760
six

322
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
um 9130s ax which is basically top of

323
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
the line cisco access point

324
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
one unique feature that we are using is

325
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,959
uh

326
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,760
the

327
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
embedded wireless controller so

328
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
basically one of those five aps

329
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
you

330
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
you uh well i think i'll talk about

331
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
later i won't get too much detail and so

332
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
for testing we use we have an aircheck

333
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
device which is really good for seeing

334
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
things like

335
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
it does both wired and wired testing and

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
you can see the channel utilization

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
signal strength and then

338
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
what ap are connected to and then you

339
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
can walk around and see how you roam to

340
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
different aps

341
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,079
very useful

342
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,399
and i have firewalls were the merakis

343
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
and switches were the cisco 9200s

344
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,560
so the emitted wires control that's what

345
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,519
i was going to say

346
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,839
so the way this works is really pretty

347
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,399
slick you take a regular ap and you

348
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,600
install the

349
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
wireless embedded wireless controller

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,079
code on it

351
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
and it now it boots up with a

352
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,680
provisioning ssid and you just connect

353
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
to that ssid with your laptop or phone

354
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
you can use the they have a cisco as an

355
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
app for it

356
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
and then once you get connected it will

357
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
basically

358
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
join all of the other ap's on the same

359
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
layer 2 network so

360
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
in my instance it'll be the other four

361
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
aps and it picks one of those and it

362
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
turns it into a secondary wireless

363
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
controller so basically upgrades code on

364
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
that so now you have two

365
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,959
wireless controllers just running on

366
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
these these five aps

367
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,399
and because they're running in what's

368
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
called flex connect mode

369
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,200
they

370
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
actually are quite autonomous you can

371
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,279
take down both controllers

372
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,079
and reboot all the ap reboot the the

373
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
standalone aps and they will come back

374
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
up with their config and be functional

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,120
they the way the flex connect works is

376
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,639
they don't tunnel their

377
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
traffic to a centralized controller like

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
a cap lap tunnel that's not how that

379
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,279
works they'd actually just dump it

380
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,880
directly to the vlans that they're

381
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,440
attached to on vlan trunk

382
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,240
um

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
but this was pretty slick first time

384
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
i've used it so i had to learn how to do

385
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
that and it was pretty fun and fun to do

386
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
and you can actually connect to 100 aps

387
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
this way

388
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,399
okay so for wireless networks you may

389
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,360
have seen these on your devices sanecon

390
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
and eduroam are both the primary

391
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
wireless for the conference

392
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
those are both those two ssids are

393
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,279
provided by the 50 aps that the

394
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
conference center provides then the

395
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
bottom two hacking island and robot cafe

396
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,959
so hacking island was a request by one

397
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,519
of the presenters they wanted to have

398
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,279
the class he was giving a like a four

399
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,120
hour class wanted the students to be

400
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,199
able to connect with ssid and hack his

401
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
servers which were also on the same vlan

402
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,680
so we did that

403
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
and

404
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,399
that's just available kind of near the

405
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,959
classroom that's doing the hacking

406
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,320
then

407
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
robot cafe is was kind of widely used

408
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
because

409
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,600
the best practice for

410
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
a lot of wireless is to turn off 2.4

411
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
gigahertz it just travels so far and

412
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,519
it's so noisy there's so many devices

413
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
that use 2.4 gigahertz there's only you

414
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
know three non-overlapping channels so

415
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
it's kind of um

416
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,000
five gigahertz is much better place to

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
be

418
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
however there are a lot of devices that

419
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
don't support five gigahertz especially

420
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
small devices like raspberry pi's and

421
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
uh drones and uh robots

422
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
so that's why we created robot cafe

423
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
and

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
the other best practice we do is we

425
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
actually don't allow you guys to talk to

426
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,639
each other or attack each other

427
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
on the wireless it's basically not

428
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
there's no peer-to-peer communication

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
over the wireless

430
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
and robot cafe is different because a

431
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
lot of those drones and

432
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,399
devices you have to like have a

433
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
controller on the same layer 2 vlan as

434
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
the device to control it

435
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
and so that's why we have that

436
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
specialized network

437
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,519
any questions about that

438
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,800
i can't hear

439
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,839
what was this question

440
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,959
no did you have one

441
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,360
uh no it's actually on the wireless

442
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
controller config it's just um i think

443
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,199
it's called peer-to-peer

444
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,639
is the setting on the on the wireless

445
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
controller

446
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
peer-to-peer isolation

447
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
and you just say drop

448
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,839
it's pretty it's pretty simple to set up

449
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,519
another question

450
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
oh

451
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,560
no i'm glad you mentioned it because

452
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
yeah i do want to mention this thank you

453
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,040
for bringing it up i should have put on

454
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
the slide i just totally forgot so dc

455
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,199
435 had a request

456
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,480
they said we want people to be able to

457
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
connect to our special wireless network

458
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
and anybody who's on it we can

459
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,000
connect a visualizer

460
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
device that basically like visualizes

461
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
the traffic that their people are

462
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
connecting to

463
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,519
so that's what they did they have a

464
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
little ap down by their booth

465
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
and anybody anybody connected to that

466
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
would now show up on their big screen tv

467
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,399
who they were talking to with with

468
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
really cool visualizations of

469
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
packet flow who you're talking to and

470
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
you could see like how much someone was

471
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,680
talking and

472
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
and like for instance some websites talk

473
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
to a million places i think this specif

474
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
because of ads mainly wasn't we thought

475
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
yeah some some websites just talk to a

476
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
ton of ad services it looks like a

477
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,000
explosion of color

478
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
so yeah thanks for bringing that up

479
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
that's another special network we set up

480
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
yep

481
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,759
um you're asking about specific

482
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,639
frequencies we're using

483
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,639
i'll be honest i'm just using the

484
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
default

485
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,599
rf

486
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
so i didn't really tweak which channels

487
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
we use

488
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
as far as a radar nearby i don't know

489
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,199
you tell me

490
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
yeah

491
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
that's a good question

492
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,679
so yeah i was going to show off the

493
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,599
cameras

494
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,919
it's a pretty neat

495
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,799
system

496
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
it's there's a meraki app that you can

497
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,120
use that we use for just instant access

498
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,200
of what's happening and also obviously

499
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,559
the website marquee website is even more

500
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,360
useful for that

501
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,320
um

502
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
one of the fun things that we like to do

503
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
is very useful for troubleshooting is

504
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
packet captures

505
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
um we

506
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
can do really fast packet captures from

507
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
the mx firewall just a couple clicks the

508
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
cisco 9200s also have that capability

509
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,720
but it's more clicks

510
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
and so still you can get the information

511
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
so for instance we set up a coup there's

512
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
a couple places where there's side to

513
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,400
side vpn

514
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
for

515
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,640
like the red versus blue set one up

516
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
and so did the lte

517
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
service that was the private lte um

518
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,559
people

519
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,840
so we uh

520
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
we use these uh packet captures to

521
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,039
figure out like when things were working

522
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
like well who's talking on what ips and

523
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
is it even is it even trying to connect

524
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
properly you fire up the packet capture

525
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
and you can see

526
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
oh you're not on the right ip let's get

527
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
that fixed

528
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
you're supposed to be on a like like for

529
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
instance one of them is a static dcp

530
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
reservation so we

531
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
um so in several cases we have

532
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
uh statically set the the ip that people

533
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
get based off their mac address

534
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
and that was for the vpns it's very

535
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,039
critical to have the static ip

536
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
and also for investigating

537
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
suspicious traffic which there's a lot

538
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
of

539
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
okay i was going to share some things i

540
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
liked and didn't like about meraki

541
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
mostly i like

542
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
2019 is when i first started using

543
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,000
meraki and basically decided that i

544
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
really like them

545
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,039
so automatic upgrades has a built-in log

546
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
so if you don't have set up a log server

547
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
it emails me whenever a change is made

548
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
so we have a team of

549
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
network people that

550
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
work on this conference and we get

551
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,799
emails anytime one of us makes a change

552
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
so it's a really great audit log and

553
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
notification that yeah someone did

554
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
something

555
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
and that's i wish i had that um

556
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
all the time it's very useful

557
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,679
it also tells you lots of information

558
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
the bandwidth usage of every client

559
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,160
their host name

560
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
their ip mac address

561
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
and the domains or at least the

562
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
categories they accessed

563
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,559
and

564
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,799
what else

565
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
we already talked about reserved gcp we

566
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,080
did we do one-to-one nat that's how we

567
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
get inbound services

568
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
we actually used uh one one to many now

569
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
also i don't know if uh for the password

570
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
cracking team they wanted to give people

571
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
access to talk to a handful of vms on

572
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,159
the password cracking server and so we

573
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
actually have one ip that maps i think

574
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,640
with 10 different ports

575
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
and it maps basically to these vms that

576
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
they have on site so that was a one to

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
many nap

578
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
you can also

579
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
whitelet you can also block somebody

580
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
pretty much with just a couple clicks

581
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
in the meraki interface

582
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
and we'll show we'll try demoing that at

583
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
the end

584
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
there are a few things i didn't like the

585
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
the firewall is very limited however i'm

586
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
giving meraki credit from 2019 they

587
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,840
added object groups so

588
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
previously it would just be you'd have

589
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
to type in specifically what ips you

590
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
wanted and you couldn't like create a

591
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
group of like admins and list all the

592
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,919
admin ips and just throw on the admin

593
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
allow admins

594
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,039
and so that's something that they've

595
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,919
added and that helps a lot

596
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,600
it doesn't have a packet tracer for

597
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
instance that's something that cisco

598
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,679
asas have that you can see what rule

599
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
it's blocked on or allowed on that

600
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
that's very helpful

601
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,280
um there's really very limited ipv6 ipv6

602
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
support

603
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,799
so maybe 20 22 will be the year they

604
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
added who knows

605
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
um and for outbound nat so everybody

606
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,280
that's on sync on pretty much goes out

607
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
one ip and that's not too big of a

608
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,120
problem but

609
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
if we wanted the ability to we have 38

610
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
30 ips we could give 10 of those ips and

611
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
say just do just load balance users

612
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,760
across those on outbound nat

613
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
you cannot do that with meraki

614
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
that i know of

615
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,880
maybe a beta version

616
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
okay so sign for some photos this is how

617
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
i set up the network there was an empty

618
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
office you know with a pandemic a lot of

619
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
people are working from home so i use

620
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
one of those offices

621
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,159
and

622
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
we have the

623
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,679
you can see the cisco 9200s

624
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,799
stacked up there and then the 9130 aps

625
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,200
my laptop and my mountain dew

626
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
although i

627
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
it's possible that it's water because i

628
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,720
refill it with water

629
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
you never know

630
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
uh labels are good

631
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
so

632
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,280
i uh set up basically um

633
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,039
on those switch the 24 port switches i

634
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,480
set up

635
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
basically ranges of

636
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
what the different things we have solar

637
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
for instance ports one through four for

638
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
the audio visual network

639
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
that's what um

640
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,480
the audio visual system does for our

641
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,320
recording and streaming

642
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
and um then we have a network for the

643
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
wired users for instance like my

644
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
connection here for all the presenters

645
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
there's a dedicated wired link so people

646
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,080
don't have to rely on wireless

647
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
for the presentations

648
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,200
and

649
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
several other things but that's how i

650
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
labeled them

651
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,159
and packed them up and threw them in my

652
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,720
minivan

653
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
this is actually a picture from last

654
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
year but it's based looks similar to

655
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
this year um the top uh little device is

656
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
centric comms

657
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,039
um

658
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,880
isp device and they actually give us two

659
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
ports on the same vlans so we actually

660
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,720
set up

661
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,039
vrrp redundancy that's how the merakis

662
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,919
work

663
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,880
in

664
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,480
an active passive redundancy

665
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,799
and of course you all know yellow means

666
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,320
single mode

667
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
fiber

668
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,280
now the conference center has both

669
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,760
single mode and multi-mode and

670
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
plenty of it so it's really nice that

671
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
they're they have enough for that to use

672
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,600
their stuff and for us to add our stuff

673
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,158
on top of it

674
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
this is just an example of of

675
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,559
the jacks that we find throughout the

676
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
place sometimes they're on the wall like

677
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
i said sometimes they're in the

678
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
floor

679
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,279
four boxes the floor boxes are huge

680
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
that's usually where power is

681
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
and

682
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,799
network cables and usually a really bad

683
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
smell

684
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,720
that's just i guess comes with the

685
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
territory

686
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
but

687
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,799
uh

688
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
uh how many of you uh use your camera to

689
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,200
document things

690
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
yeah it's such a nice thing to instead

691
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
writing down a notepad it's like boom

692
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,440
you got it and you're not gonna fat

693
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,159
finger in a typo or anything and

694
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
sometimes you get additional information

695
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
too like what was next to it and

696
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,080
so i use that all the time for

697
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
documenting things

698
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,320
oh let's compare

699
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,279
the two years 2019 and 2021.

700
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,360
so this

701
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
uh number shows that

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,640
um

703
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
vlan 34 is basically the sync on ssid

704
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
and there was 1280 devices that that

705
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,159
used that ssid this was in 2019

706
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,240
so let's check out 20 21.

707
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,360
so i included 35 vlan 35 which is

708
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,320
eduroam and 34 is sink on so it's kind

709
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
of interesting

710
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
you can see that at least 378 people are

711
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
using a drum that's a lot

712
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
you know that's one third of the

713
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,400
conference attendees

714
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
and

715
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,679
i don't think you can quite add these up

716
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,039
because a lot of people connected to

717
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,279
both ssids and so they would get an ip

718
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,520
on both

719
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
so yeah i couldn't i don't think

720
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
accounting adding them up actually is

721
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
accurate but i think the 1224 is a

722
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,799
pretty good way of saying

723
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,360
it's about similar amount of devices as

724
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
2019

725
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,360
and then what types of devices

726
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,840
in 2019 43 percent were apple

727
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
and this next closest one was intel

728
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
which was around 19

729
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
and so

730
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
the thing that's missing from this chart

731
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,240
this is 2019.

732
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
there's about 30 percent not accounted

733
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
for and rocky used to not say like other

734
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,039
you'll see in the next one they actually

735
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,400
do call it other

736
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
and that's

737
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
caused by mac address randomization

738
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,559
which

739
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,600
modern

740
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
mobile devices in the end even you know

741
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,440
desktop devices

742
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,400
or

743
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
like windows devices will do

744
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
mac address randomization that's just a

745
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,039
privacy feature

746
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,960
it's

747
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
makes it gives you privacy and it also

748
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,600
makes it harder for admins to

749
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,279
control on their network and understand

750
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,960
what's happening

751
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
it's a trade-off

752
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
okay so what else that i was going to

753
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
show on this

754
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
um

755
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
okay so apple's at 43 let's see what

756
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,360
happens next

757
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,840
so apple dropped to 22

758
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,360
however the the other

759
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
went from 30 to 44

760
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,200
so what i think is that a lot of people

761
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
are getting apple updates and apples

762
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
apple's one of the biggest proponents of

763
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
the mac address randomization so that's

764
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,559
kind of why i think apple's dropped i

765
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,559
don't think people bought less apples

766
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,480
devices

767
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,080
i think that the apple devices now

768
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,159
turned on mac address randomization so

769
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,000
you don't really know who what kind of

770
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,480
device it is

771
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
uh for as far as bandwidth

772
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,159
um this was a slide from la 2019 and

773
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,960
you can see the peak day was about 600

774
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
megabits per second and we have a gig

775
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
link

776
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,880
funny story about gig links

777
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
when i first bought my

778
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,720
at my house i'm lucky enough to have

779
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,840
centurylink

780
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
gigabit fiber they don't call it gigabit

781
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
fiber anymore i think they call it 940

782
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
or 960 which would make sense because

783
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
there's overhead and you're never really

784
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,399
going to get a gigabit and people

785
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,919
probably complain saying i'm only

786
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,520
getting 9.50

787
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,840
i'm only getting

788
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,679
that's supposed to be getting a gig

789
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,480
but

790
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,919
so yeah that's

791
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,200
so as far so we're getting um

792
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
about 600 peak based off this average i

793
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
know this doesn't include instantaneous

794
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
bursts but based off the data we have

795
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,919
600 megabits

796
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:04,960
and

797
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
the total data transferred was 1.3

798
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
terabytes

799
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,639
let's look at 20 20 21.

800
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
so there's a lot more data transferred i

801
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,399
also

802
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
expanded the the graph to show the full

803
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,840
week

804
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,080
but the funny thing is the uh the peak

805
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,480
download was also 600

806
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
megabits per second so the similar peak

807
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,760
transfer

808
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,480
but we did transfer a lot more and then

809
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,840
the total unique clients that's kind of

810
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,039
cool

811
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,320
that's basically how many mac addresses

812
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,440
have we seen so about 1700 devices that

813
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,720
includes

814
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
wired and

815
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,000
i assume it includes all of our all of

816
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,840
our management devices

817
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,039
cameras like i said

818
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,640
and

819
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
as far as what what were people doing

820
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
just from like a high level the biggest

821
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,679
usage of our application was just udp

822
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,960
traffic

823
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,080
and what do you guys think udp traffic

824
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
was was probably

825
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,279
i think that's a good guess vpn

826
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,039
yeah

827
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,720
it could be other things too but

828
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,039
that's that's a really good guess

829
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,760
um what else we have oh so microsoft.com

830
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
so let's see how that's number three and

831
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,640
it was about seven gigabytes last year

832
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,320
our last conference here

833
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,159
let's look at the next one uh so this

834
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,960
year udp was still the

835
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
the biggest and microsoft.com went up to

836
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,679
440 gigabytes per second so there must

837
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,520
have been a big windows update

838
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,480
or something people

839
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,640
oh yeah downloading isos from microsoft

840
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
yeah i think i think was the dev like

841
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,520
class that did that or someone else's

842
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600
oh shakespeare's okay

843
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,960
yeah so downloading isos for classrooms

844
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
could would cause a lot of traffic

845
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,960
oh my my question was why so much itunes

846
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
i thought that had like died

847
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,640
i don't know why it says that does

848
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,760
anybody have idea why there's a lot of

849
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,080
itunes traffic

850
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
yeah exactly yeah it could be actually

851
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
apple music

852
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
um and it just shows up as itunes

853
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,799
because it's the same

854
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,960
network that it came from

855
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,760
yeah that's a good theory

856
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
it does have icloud separately i'm

857
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,520
seeing like maybe people just doing

858
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,279
backups

859
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,399
the icloud's pretty low

860
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
okay some lessons that we learned this

861
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,720
year

862
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
equipment that's in public areas will be

863
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,760
touched

864
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,720
so

865
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
that happens in two different ways

866
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
we had

867
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,640
a kids night there was some pretty crazy

868
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,919
drone flying

869
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
and

870
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,720
one of our

871
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
cameras got knocked over

872
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399
and i wasn't actually there to see it

873
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,559
but um we had to pick we were there to

874
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,158
re you know re-aim afterwards

875
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,080
and then the other thing that happened

876
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
is

877
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
some hackers challenged players

878
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
actually tapped into one of our aps that

879
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,720
were mounted on the expo floor

880
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,080
and

881
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,279
that's not something i really want them

882
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,960
to do because

883
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
it really makes my job hard when things

884
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,559
are going up and down without

885
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,440
and being modified without my knowledge

886
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,760
i'm not really upset about it because

887
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,080
it's possible that it was considered

888
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,840
a fair game so that's what i'm saying

889
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,039
maybe i'm going to do warning labels

890
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,880
next time like this is not considered

891
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,120
part of that any challenge please don't

892
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,440
hack this and i you know we're in people

893
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,159
at st con are usually very

894
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,760
honest and

895
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,000
willing to obey um

896
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,840
i think something like that i hope so

897
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,120
big no big deal but that's just

898
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
something that

899
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,919
we either need to not put in a public

900
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,519
area or

901
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,039
definitely add some labels that this is

902
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,440
not part of any challenge

903
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,480
and then

904
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,120
as far as a way we can improve

905
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,679
we had a couple problems where an access

906
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,559
point was plugged into a management port

907
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,200
and that was frustrating to find to find

908
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
out what was happening because the flex

909
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,120
i talked about the flex mode aps

910
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,399
they

911
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,399
have a v they require vlan trunk to send

912
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,480
the wireless networks through well the

913
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
management port actually connected into

914
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,600
the controller just fine so the

915
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
controller's like yeah this ap is good

916
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
to go

917
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
and but it wasn't good to go it had no

918
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,080
vlans trunk to it it was just a access

919
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,200
port

920
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,880
and um

921
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,760
so we that was one of the problems that

922
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,440
some of you may know about is that we

923
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,799
had problems

924
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
with some of the wireless ssids that i

925
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
created had not not working until i

926
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,120
fixed the vlan trunk so that was a

927
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
problem that could be solved by better

928
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
testing

929
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,240
like after setup so we're going to try

930
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
to do that next year

931
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,039
once again thanks for the sponsors we

932
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,159
really appreciate

933
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:54,880
the

934
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,519
value they provide

935
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,279
and uh any questions so far or

936
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,240
any questions let's start here

937
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,159
that's that's a really good question so

938
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,840
the question is

939
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
um

940
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,600
what's it like to work with the

941
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,440
conference center and how do they charge

942
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
for all the special network access that

943
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
we're getting from them and the answer

944
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,039
is they're great to work with and they

945
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,120
don't charge us anything extra they just

946
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
love having us as a customer

947
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,559
and um

948
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,360
i think we're one of the biggest

949
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,120
conferences that they have

950
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,279
and so they're very flexible they're

951
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,799
very

952
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,080
you mentioned the salt palace is very

953
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
restrictive and very formal it's not

954
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
that way here

955
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
that's one of the reasons we really like

956
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,279
being here

957
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,519
go ahead

958
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,200
um from my perspective i just do it ad

959
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
hoc so i don't i wasn't capturing

960
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,960
packets 24 or 7. um there's there's only

961
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,280
like the netflow type data like

962
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
like like you've kind of seen

963
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
very limited

964
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,719
capture of what was talking to what

965
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
we didn't really have a reason to

966
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,199
capture packets

967
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
so we didn't capture them it was only

968
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,119
for like you would turn it on and sit

969
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
watch the packets like oh yeah that's

970
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,359
that's good or that's not good and turn

971
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,480
it off

972
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,359
so

973
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,000
that's what we did

974
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,040
question i saw more hands

975
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,560
no wireless on the balcony

976
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,599
that's

977
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,280
not um

978
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,040
i don't think there is any wireless aps

979
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,599
on the balcony um if you if you were out

980
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,280
there and you saw those big lte devices

981
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
those are actually for the private ltd

982
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,680
challenge

983
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,800
um but no no wi-fi i don't think they

984
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
explicitly excluded it but i know

985
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
there's no outdoor aps and there's no

986
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
antennas facing that way

987
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,599
so is that like something you would like

988
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,800
to see

989
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,599
i could tell the conference center

990
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
rf jammer

991
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,520
it's always possible go ahead

992
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,320
so the question about some of the

993
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,000
problems we had with eduroam

994
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,320
and i am not certain of all the details

995
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
about that but there was an institution

996
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,839
that was testing and finding some

997
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,160
problems and i was able to make some

998
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,040
changes that made a jerome happier

999
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
so

1000
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
jerome as far as i know is working

1001
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,279
pretty well right now

1002
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
questions

1003
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,920
oh okay

1004
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,640
so

1005
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
eduroam

1006
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,400
like i said it's going to be a permanent

1007
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
installation of eduroam basically the

1008
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,720
the 50 aps that are doing

1009
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,960
um the sink on right now they're gonna

1010
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
we're gonna turn off sync on and we're

1011
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
gonna leave on eduroam and they'll stay

1012
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
that way and we'll we actually have a

1013
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,119
small

1014
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,359
pf sense firewall that we leave here

1015
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,800
year round for when the conference isn't

1016
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,079
happening

1017
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,599
and that's so ed jerome should be

1018
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,480
working year-round for when we leave yep

1019
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
i appreciate the questions go ahead

1020
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,079
um that's a good question

1021
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,440
is

1022
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
oh it's my life how much sleep we don't

1023
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,000
need the laptop

1024
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
the question is do we think centrical

1025
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,280
might be

1026
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,240
throttling the

1027
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
the network and the question is i i

1028
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,440
don't think so just because i don't i

1029
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
don't see like a

1030
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
a flat lining type effect

1031
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
i just seems like the peaks naturally

1032
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
kind of stop there

1033
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,880
you could be right but i mean

1034
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,160
they were really good to work with as

1035
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
well they like we have direct access to

1036
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,400
them

1037
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
and they

1038
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,200
they are um i think they would tell us

1039
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,480
if they were doing that

1040
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
yeah and i didn't see any indications

1041
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,520
that that was happening

1042
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,000
i never saw it like flat line at

1043
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
600.

1044
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
but it's possible there's some other

1045
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
reason that it's not going above 600 but

1046
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
we'll see

1047
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,839
good question

1048
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,280
