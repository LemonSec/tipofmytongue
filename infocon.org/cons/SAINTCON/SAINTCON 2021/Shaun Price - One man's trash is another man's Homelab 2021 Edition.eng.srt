17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,519
there that's nice right

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440

i am sean price also known as clipper um

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,199
a little bit about me i'm a uvu graduate

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,399
from right here in the valley um you've

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,840
probably seen this about me slide before

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
because i reuse it because i like doing

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
this

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
um i love wireshark packet capture um if

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
you haven't done the ctf the pack after

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
ctf it's fantastic go play it it's been

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
a lot of fun had a lot of fun with that

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
i have strong opinions about vlans and

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
network segmentations i've had that

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,119
bullet point for probably six years now

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
and i will never take it out

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
i'm a mountain bike enthusiast i love

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
old school stereo systems

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
fast scars 3d printing and most

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
breakfast foods even the ones that are

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,799
cut off at the bottom

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
so when i first thought about doing this

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,320
presentation i was like yeah we'll do an

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,279
update 2021.

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,240
and then supply chains hit

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
then budgets were smashed

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
and then enterprises weren't replacing

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,560
their gear

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
so all this like dumpster diving antics

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
that we've become so accustomed to as

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
people just throw away gear yeah that

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,320
dried up quite a bit

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,439
so

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
what have we done since last time now if

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
you came to my 2019 presentation you

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,560
might remember this slide right here is

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
anyone remember the slide that i put up

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
from 2019 and i said hey

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
if someone was to go really crazy and do

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
something awesome build a nas out of

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
that box right there that super micro

62
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
cse 846

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,320
and i waited

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
and i waited

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,440
and none of you did it so i did

66
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
i wish you would have done it you would

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,520
have saved me all this time and effort

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
but alas i went and bought one because

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
it looked exciting and fun

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
um as you can see

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
notice that price when i bought it we'll

72
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
show you an updated version of that in

73
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
just a bit

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
here is the build

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
build picture the first one i did of it

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
as you can see i've actually just got a

77
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
regular intel reference board in there

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
that's not a super microboard if you do

79
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,120
decide to do regular reference intel

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
reference board and you are in a super

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
micro chassis you need to buy that guy

82
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
right there and i've got a link to that

83
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
um all of this information i'm going to

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,519
provide via sketch or sketch i don't

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
know how you say that that thing

86
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
i'm going to have the presentation there

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
i'm also gonna do a spreadsheet of all

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
the stuff i've bought recently and kind

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
of the links to get it so if you're if

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,760
you're into buying some of that you can

91
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,959
do that i'll make sure that little

92
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,239
adapter's in there

93
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
um shout out to the novel support

94
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
connection mouse pad that thing i got it

95
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
in 2001 on a tour of novell's campus i

96
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
still use it daily

97
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,920
the chassis is right there getting built

98
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
and

99
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
so if you remember before the best place

100
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
to get spinning drives is your local

101
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
friendly best buy on black friday and i

102
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
said hey i'll see y'all there well no

103
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
one else came it was just me i drove up

104
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
and down the valley on

105
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
midnight on thanksgiving evening um i

106
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
called my sister to get her out of bed

107
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,319
and say hey will you come with me and go

108
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080

109
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
fun thanks for the invite well i didn't

110
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
know if they're going to say one per

111
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
customer or if they were going to like

112
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
they had my picture from other antics

113
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
i've done at best buys before i don't

114
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
know so she came with me

115
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
i drove up and down the wasatch front

116
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
and picked up these drives now

117
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
everyone told me it's like you can buy

118
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
these online and it's the same price you

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
don't need to do this i'm like well i'm

120
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
going to be special i'm going to go to

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,519
different best buys to make sure i get

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
different batches and get different

123
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,720
serial numbers so let's say there was a

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
bad day at the factory and i'll get

125
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,280
fresh ones

126
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
all my serial numbers are like within a

127
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
thousand of each other but whatever i

128
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,920
went to six best buys got almost the

129
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
same one

130
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
so anyone who's into drives and data

131
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
hoarding like myself you have to burn

132
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,959
these bad boys in and make sure they're

133
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
good so here they all are set up in your

134
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,439
original cases rookie mistake number one

135
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,839
that i have done um you shuck them first

136
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
and then test them bad idea

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,279
because when it

138
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
inevitably fails you have to put it back

139
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
in the enclosure to take it back

140
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
there are stories about people sending

141
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
them back to the factory shocked and

142
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,680
it's okay but for safety sake i i think

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
you should keep them in the in the

144
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
clamshell until you're sure they're

145
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
happy there they are right now running

146
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,000
bad blocks you can see bad boxes running

147
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
right here all six of them burning in

148
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
one thing that not a lot of people know

149
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
is you should probably put a fan blowing

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
down through them or on them or around

151
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
them while you're doing this because

152
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
those enclosures aren't really meant to

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
be running 24 7 really heavy workloads

154
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
and they can get hot so just get a fan

155
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
blowing on them you'll see my super

156
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,360
scientific sticky notes right there with

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
the serial number of each drive in the

158
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
model that i pulled off of it just for

159
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
my own references

160
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
but that's them bad boxing luckily

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
they're all great and they're in service

162
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
now

163
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,360
and that's what it looks like in the

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
rack all happy and cozy so i've got

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
these this is full right here of those

166
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
ones that i showed you i put my old

167
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
drives in that row and then i've got two

168
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
more rows for future expansion so

169
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
pretty awesome

170
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
truenas looks like that

171
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,479
got myself

172
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
96 gigs of ram

173
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
storage 10 gig all that and that's what

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
ends up looking like build so

175
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
unfortunately none of you would build it

176
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,160
for me so i had to do it myself

177
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,440
csc846s are now 1300.

178
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
why

179
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
well companies have been asked to slash

180
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
budget which slash budgets which include

181
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
putting off upgrades and hardware

182
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
refreshes and all that there's a global

183
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,759
chip shortage you may or may not have

184
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,720
heard about

185
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
supply lines are terrible there's a

186
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,039
queue outside the ports to get stuff in

187
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,479
cryptocurrency mining is getting super

188
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,759
popular and happy so everyone's buying

189
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,400
gpus chia killed all the hard drive

190
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
markets thank you so much for that and

191
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
you're all out there buying it

192
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
literally when i looked through last

193
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
time most of the things i presented were

194
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
bought within about a week and they're

195
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
all dried up so that's great i'm glad

196
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
you're buying it it's so good um

197
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
so talking about hard drive specifically

198
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
on the slide um best buy did in 2020 due

199
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
to 14 terabyte drives for 189 so they

200
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,479
may do it again this year i sure hope

201
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
they do if they are we'll see you again

202
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
may you not um if those out in the

203
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,479
market is anyone in the market for gpu

204
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
right now struggling with that one a

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
little bit

206
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,759
the best place right now to find a gpu

207
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
somewhat reliably is your best buy

208
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
they're they're letting people know when

209
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,639
they're going to get their next

210
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,319
shipments and drop in you have to show

211
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
up the next morning about 6 30 6 45 7

212
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,280
o'clock get your wristband and get in

213
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
line and you may get lucky

214
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,199
that's where we're at with those

215
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,800
so what makes a good home lab let's just

216
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
talk about the basics we've gone over

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
this before but we'll do it again you

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
got your cpu for your compute your ram

219
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
um ecc for servers and workstation class

220
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,560
you need a chassis something to put in

221
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
in some courts of some sorts a bmc and

222
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
ilo and out-of-bound management super

223
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
nice to have if you can swing it

224
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,479
storage is going to be your most

225
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,680
variable cost of course you get your

226
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,440
cash you got your capacity

227
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,960
networking we got to get some switching

228
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
10 gig if we can swing it which we still

229
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
can which is awesome nicks are still

230
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,199
available and optics and decks are great

231
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
just remember this is a marathon not a

232
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,039
sprint i get excited you all get excited

233
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
we all do it we go to a presentation on

234
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,199
the home lab and you were all so

235
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
inspired by my presentation

236
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
that you go out there and want to buy

237
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
stuff that's awesome but just remember

238
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
there's always another deal that's

239
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
probably something my dad taught me from

240
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
day one i'd get really excited about

241
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,599
something and i said dad this deal is

242
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
only going on today we have to do it

243
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
he's like there's always another deal so

244
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
there is so if you don't get some part

245
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
that's okay go on to the go into your

246
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
backup plan or wait a little bit and

247
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
you'll get through it

248
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
um if you remember i created this called

249
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
the ideal home lab trifecta you've got

250
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
your uptrend upfront cost of the

251
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
hardware you're buying you've got your

252
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
ongoing cost which is your power cost

253
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,879
and then you got your performance and

254
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
you want to balance all those three and

255
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
then you have to go through a big old

256
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,479
gate called the cohabitant acceptance

257
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,800
factor

258
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,080
that is a gnarly gate my friends

259
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
for me easiest kid on planet i live

260
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
alone so anything goes server on the

261
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
floor serving the entryway tripping on

262
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,199
hard drives that's all good for some of

263
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,039
you fine folks that might not be as easy

264
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,000
we're going to talk about that a little

265
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
bit

266
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
uh yeah i i dedicate a slide to it

267
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,759
saying yes this is a challenge

268
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
dealing with the chaff we're going to

269
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
we're going to do this things that help

270
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,679
you making a homeless home pro or home

271
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
prod useful for everyone in your home

272
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
build a media server and say hey look

273
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
how easy this is to watch all of our

274
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
videos isn't this nice oh it is this is

275
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
from the home lab that you spent all

276
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
this money and all those hours in the

277
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
basement tink run great buy more yes

278
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,440
good

279
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,920
automated backups honey let me install a

280
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
tool that you'll never have to worry

281
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,959
about your data it'll automatically just

282
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,680
back up to our server in the basement

283
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
not to worry hey good hey yeah buy more

284
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
buy more hard drives go have fun on

285
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
thanksgiving night fighting all those

286
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,839
crazies out there

287
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,519
included uh cameras and security put

288
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
some surveillance up make them feel nice

289
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
and safe great thing

290
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
keeping your home have neat and tidy

291
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
also a great thing to do if it is oozing

292
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,600
all over the house you will have a bad

293
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
time

294
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
being upfront with the cost and

295
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,240
expectations of costs if you say hey

296
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
running the server is only going to cost

297
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
us a quarter a day

298
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
that may be accurate

299
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
but when you do the math over the cost

300
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
of a year that's a lot of money so be

301
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,360
upfront with that and then show them how

302
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
it's like progress your benefited your

303
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
career your job your brand show all the

304
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
great things of it things that hurt the

305
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,040
home lab it's loud

306
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
yes i love putting enterprise enterprise

307
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
gear in my house yes it's loud no it's

308
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
not white noise quit telling yourself

309
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,560
that lie it's not it's miserable

310
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
it's ugly yes it is ugly it's meant to

311
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
go in a data center not in your parlor

312
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,560
keep hidden

313
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
it never seems to end there's always

314
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
just one more thing to buy or change

315
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
but the number one thing i heard and

316
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
this is the feedback i got last time

317
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
specifically was there just isn't room

318
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,680
for it you know i'm in a small apartment

319
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
or i've just got a bedroom in this place

320
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,920
there's no room for for a home lab so

321
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,479
you know what you do

322
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,360
you hide it in plain sight

323
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,200
thank you

324
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200

lacs

331
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
and what the lac lacs

332
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
is solid legs

333
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
uh years ago they were solid all the way

334
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,399
through and it was great and they

335
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
weren't fantastic recently and even up

336
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
to like five years ago they've gone to a

337
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
hollow leg system

338
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
so this is what i did with mine i'm not

339
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,839
gonna hit too much on this part like

340
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,360
what i did because if i didn't turn out

341
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
amazing it's okay but i'll tell you what

342
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
went wrong

343
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
but these legs are hollow they are a

344
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
cardboard tube

345
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
so what you end up doing is you cut out

346
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,279
that little it's just a little end plug

347
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
right there and there's an end plug on

348
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
the bottom you pop those out

349
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
and then you drop a two by two down it

350
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
and when you drop a two by two on it you

351
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
end up with four solid legs now when i

352
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
told my dad about this project he goes

353
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
well why don't you just get a two by

354
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,079
four cut it down so it's perfect so it

355
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,120
doesn't wobble in there because those

356
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
legs are about 1.75 and a two by two

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
that comes out to like one five so they

358
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
kind of rattle around in there and i was

359
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
like well i want to make it so if you

360
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
didn't have power tools at home or you

361
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
just want to use those free cuts at home

362
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
depot or lowe's or whatever you can just

363
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
cut it to length and use some grabber

364
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,959
shoes to tie it in there you could cut

365
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,079
it down to make it look a little bit

366
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
better but it's in a leg so do we worry

367
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,839
about that too much

368
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
so nothing too wild about these raccoons

369
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,200
i put them on right here you can see the

370
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,560
metal rack rails and they're right here

371
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,680
on the front

372
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
i put those on because i want it to be a

373
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
little bit more robust when when you're

374
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
working with a two post rack all of your

375
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,680
strength and all of your mounting

376
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
security comes from having those nice

377
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,800
those rackers nice and tight on those

378
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
front rails so i thought because a lot

379
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,240
of people just put grabber screws in it

380
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
and just go right into the wood and it

381
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
makes it hard because you might get a

382
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,519
good grab in there over time they're

383
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,720
going to rattle and it's going to make

384
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,079
that wood kind of

385
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
disintegrate and break apart i did the

386
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,959
middle rails thing could that be a

387
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,480
little bit more robust and it is it is

388
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,600
actually pretty sturdy in there like

389
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,959
they're not they're not going anywhere

390
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
they're solid

391
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
um but the trouble is i lose the

392
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
tolerance in between these legs so right

393
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
default out of the gate you can fit most

394
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,760
devices between those legs just fine

395
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
you put those metal rack rails in there

396
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
and you lose

397
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
about an eighth of an inch maybe

398
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
maybe a quarter and so if you've got

399
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,399
something that's a little bit wide you

400
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,360
kind of have to jimmy it in there and

401
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
the legs bow out a little bit so that's

402
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
kind of one danger i ran into it

403
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
um the stuff i've got in here all fits

404
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
great but i did try to put some other

405
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
switches i had and i had to run into i

406
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
had to run into troubles with that

407
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
a shout out to yukaya for letting me

408
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
borrow stuff to put in there

409
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
um what it could look like in your home

410
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
could look like that

411
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
that could be your home lab just sitting

412
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
there right next to your roomba

413
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,880
careful with your cables don't let room

414
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,760
eat them

415
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
um

416
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,959
i went for some other

417
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,560
alternatives where i put like a book on

418
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
it but i think a tablecloth with the uh

419
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
the lamps the most homey and the most

420
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
acceptable

421
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
uh so

422
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,920
one other thing that i've heard a lot of

423
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
feedback on is i kind of take things to

424
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,160
the extreme and anyone that knows me

425
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
knows i do this every time i'll get an

426
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
idea and i'll just become like

427
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
infatuated with it i'll just go crazy

428
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,040
everything i can do about it learn

429
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
everything go to the tens

430
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
not everyone wants to do it that way and

431
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
that's cool and to be honest most of our

432
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
home lab workflows that we're working

433
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
with require much less resource than

434
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
we're thinking like honestly

435
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
who's running hardcore stuff on their

436
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
home lab 24 7.

437
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
most of the time it's idle just hanging

438
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
out so the whole point is to try out new

439
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
technologies new methodologies learn

440
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
ideas and stuff not really running prod

441
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
here um

442
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,440
and when it's running 24 7 because you

443
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
don't want to spin it down and spin it

444
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959
up those twin 130 watt tdp processors

445
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
that are so fast they get pricey and

446
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
they get warm so it's not a lot of fun

447
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
so

448
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
i've also found that a lot of

449
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
enterprises are starting to get rid of

450
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
these very small form factor devices

451
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,199
that are used in call centers that are

452
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,519
used for data workers just very tiny not

453
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,800
necessarily think clients talking to a

454
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
back-end vdi but we're actually talking

455
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
about true small compute nodes now these

456
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
first ones we're going to hit are

457
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
actually thin clients um super

458
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
affordable this guy right here the hp

459
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,399
t620 41 right now

460
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,199
uh four core software on chip amd or

461
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,320
soldered on

462
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
uh it's a gx415 not the fastest you're

463
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
not gonna win any speed records on it

464
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,959
but it still will pretty work pretty

465
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
well for you uh you can officially have

466
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,639
16 gigs of ram one of these but folks

467
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
have taken them up to 32 gig no problem

468
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
at all and so four core 32 gig ram with

469
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
an msata ssd so you can have a little

470
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
storage built on there for 41 bucks

471
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
three of those it's a pretty cheap home

472
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,839
lab if you want to do like a little k3s

473
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,040
cluster or something like that that'd be

474
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,079
super cool

475
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,839
uh the hp t620 plus is all of the above

476
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,399
but you get a pci express slot now what

477
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,760
could you do with that

478
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
you could put in a 10 gig ethernet card

479
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,839
which would be awesome go up to 10 gig

480
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,360
or you could actually do a hba

481
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
and run a drive shelf off that guy so

482
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
you could have a shelf a just a dumb

483
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
shelf full of drives hanging out the

484
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
back put an hpi in that for your compute

485
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
for a hundred dollars plus the cost of a

486
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,639
shelf you've got yourself the biggest

487
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
scale out and as you could buy for

488
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
cheap super cheap

489
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
keeping on the same topic of our thin

490
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
clients you got the hp t730 that is a

491
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,639
four core soc but it's the amd rx series

492
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
427 that actually has a gpu built into

493
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
it so if you want to do some gpu uh work

494
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
built on that you can do that i guess

495
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
it's an e it's an apu instead of a jeep

496
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,199
or a gpu it's an apu

497
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
uh again 16 gigs ram officially you can

498
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,440
take them up to 32 it has a half height

499
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,519
pci express slot just like i spoke

500
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,399
earlier

501
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
but it has m.2

502
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
for nvme so if you want to be a little

503
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
bit quicker storage or utilize an nvme

504
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
you have you could totally do it with

505
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
that one word of caution on those

506
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
there's not a lot of air that moves

507
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480
through those guys so if you've got a

508
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
pci express slot that or a card that's

509
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
pretty hot pumping out some heat you

510
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
might want to think of some aftermarket

511
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
cooling or get a fan blowing on there or

512
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
something you could run in some troubles

513
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,880
uh the next we're gonna come to the

514
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,160
lenovo m900 tiny this guy is a hundred

515
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
twenty dollars

516
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
has an i5 6500t or higher there are some

517
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
higher ones four core and it does have v

518
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
pro if you want to do your intel remote

519
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
stuff super awesome uh up to 32 gig gram

520
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,079
officially and it has a 2.5 inch uh

521
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
saturn connecting there too so if you

522
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
want to do some like maybe a very small

523
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,839
like hyper converge setup you could have

524
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
an nvme for a cache and a sata for your

525
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
capacity build two three of those up

526
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
you'd have your pre yourself a pretty

527
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
sweet uh hci lab for not too much

528
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,680
keeping it going on you a little bit

529
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
more i'm just going to keep jumping up

530
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
on many got optiplex 50 50 micros that

531
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,160
way you're going up to a 7600 t uh one

532
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
cool thing about if you stay above the

533
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
6000 and the 7000 series you will be

534
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,039
able to take advantage of quick sync

535
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,319
intel quick sync and that's kind of

536
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,439
where the

537
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,799
really where like most of the features

538
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
came were usable by that point so if you

539
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,520
want to do a pretty awesome um media

540
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,760
server and do transcoding with your

541
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,359
gpu that'd be a great option

542
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,199
um these are your performance kind of

543
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,079
what you're looking at if you're going

544
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,599
to go with any of those options that's

545
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
just your just benchmark so we can kind

546
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,640
of see kind of what the cost difference

547
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
does we'll go back there just kind of

548
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,960
look

549
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
120 dollars is going to be

550
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
in this arena right here your 41 dollars

551
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
are right about there and they just kind

552
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
of move up so more money more

553
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
performance that's how it goes

554
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
one thing i did want to show you and

555
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
i've got one here today

556
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,880
is this ec200a

557
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
thanks to donno for sending this to me

558
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,600
this guy was sent to or was marketed

559
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
towards our friends who do like branch

560
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
servers you know want like just a little

561
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
small compute note of their branch

562
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
z on d 1518 four quarters eight threads

563
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
up to 64 gigs of ecc ram um has an ilo 4

564
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
for out of band management super cool

565
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,000
uh two more and two additional gigabit

566
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
copper nics two 3.5 inch hard drive

567
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,919
trays and you can 3d print those on

568
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,520
thingiverse there are some adapters for

569
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
them and an m.2 nvme and these can be

570
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
had for 150 to 200. if you wanted to

571
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
build yourself a pf sense or an open

572
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
sense or some kind of software router

573
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
it's a good option if you're standing

574
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,280
under a gig

575
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
pretty cool right there

576
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,799
now

577
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,559
this is the level setting slide for

578
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,240
myself i put the slide in for myself you

579
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,320
can just look at it

580
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,679
does my work road really need 45 cores

581
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
am i simply heating up my house for no

582
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
reason

583
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
do my workloads justify this much nvme

584
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,000
or do i need poe for every port

585
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
he chose not to listen to the voice of

586
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,400
reason and send it anyway

587
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,120
just going to send it

588
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
okay obtaining components now we're

589
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,880
going to go from our thin

590
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
client they're thin light cute we can

591
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
hide them their stuff we're going to

592
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,280
talk about a little bit bigger stuff now

593
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,039
which will be super awesome

594
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,320
obtaining your components these are kind

595
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
of your bread and butter places to get

596
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
them end of life decommission equipment

597
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
from your employer if you have a pc

598
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
purchase program or a recycling program

599
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
see what they can do to

600
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
make that a system for your employees be

601
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,840
able to buy your ex gear make sure you

602
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,160
do proper data destruction policies of

603
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
course make sure to follow those

604
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,039
have a guy

605
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,799
have someone you know that has hardware

606
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,000
i'm going to plug the utah home labs

607
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
discord a lot of folks have been joined

608
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
that there's tons of us out there who

609
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
are buying selling trading getting rid

610
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,320
of stuff you can find some good deals

611
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
there of course you got your classifieds

612
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
your facebook marketplace your ebays and

613
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
then your fourth would be your it

614
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,440
recyclers um they generally charge a

615
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
little bit more sometimes you get a

616
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
warranty um that's how it goes

617
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
talking compute um we're gonna talk from

618
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
the jump from 2019 to 2021 these are

619
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
basically the processors in a v2 versus

620
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,799
e3 we are going to make the jump in 2021

621
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
to ddr4 yes

622
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,240
we finally got the price down to where

623
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
it it justifies it i believe

624
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,159
um right now if you want to get real

625
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
excited here are the secret treasures

626
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
that i promise you

627
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
remember the think server rs 140s that i

628
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
was really happy about the 2019 uh back

629
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,679
in 2019 this is their dell cousin

630
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,120
r220s

631
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,159
um those cpus do have quick sync for

632
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:22,960
that

633
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
16 gigs of ram you can fit a 16x pci

634
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
express slot in there they're short of

635
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
depth they're 1u they're quiet they'll

636
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,240
run all day and they're 200 bucks

637
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,520
great place to start if you wanted to

638
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,919
start in iraq um and they fit quite

639
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
nicely that's the that's the lenovo one

640
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,919
but they're the same size

641
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,360
the next secret hidden one is the

642
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
gigabyte r160 and r180 these came under

643
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,520
various different um marketing um

644
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
penguin computing use these um rely on

645
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
was one of these these are e5 v3 v4s

646
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,799
they've got 16 ddr4 slots

647
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,640
four sata hot swap bays i know i wish

648
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
they were sas but they're sata

649
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,559
two pci express slots and they're a full

650
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,039
length in a 1u so they are a full length

651
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
so full length but in a 1u and has a

652
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,320
pretty good out of band management and

653
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,520
they're about 230 to 250 right now and

654
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
as far as like

655
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,039
the the age old question well aren't 1u

656
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,120
servers really loud we always hear that

657
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
it's actually not bad i'm running one of

658
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
those myself and you'll see a picture of

659
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,080
it here in a bit one thing you can

660
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,600
always do well not always if you're out

661
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
of band management supports it or if

662
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
your ipmi supports this or if you hop in

663
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
there and change it one great thing to

664
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
do is

665
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
get your cpus in there get get them get

666
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,919
your heat spreaders on there make sure

667
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
that's as efficient as you can and crank

668
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
prime95 crank suddenly start just

669
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
rocking cpu just start churning cpu get

670
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,400
them hot and then you go to your pwm and

671
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
start offsetting it down just ticking

672
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
that down little by little until you get

673
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
to the point where cpus are about to

674
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
thermal then kick it up a little bit

675
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,559
from there and you'll probably stay

676
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,400
under your thermals by doing that you

677
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
can make it idle and be much more quiet

678
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
when it's not working granted when it

679
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
spins up it still will spin up and you

680
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
still will he'll hear it but you'll know

681
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,600
based on that exercise doing the prime95

682
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
and kind of getting it where you wanted

683
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
it you're not going to overheat it so

684
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
it is great they're quiet most the time

685
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
if you get some really heavy loads on it

686
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,039
you will start to see

687
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
you will hear those fans start throttle

688
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,280
up

689
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,799
in this test bench right here this is

690
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,919
dual

691
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,799
uh 2693 v3s and i've actually got it

692
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,799
idling at 92 watts

693
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
and that test system has 256 gigs of ram

694
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,720
in it so

695
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,440
uh that's twin 12 cores 256 gram and

696
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
we're under 100 watts really not bad for

697
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
what you're getting there

698
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,679
now i want to talk about one of another

699
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
failure because i think that's what i

700
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,000
think that's why most of you come is to

701
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,520
listen about all the boneheaded things i

702
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
do when i first got that proc or first

703
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
got that setup i was going to do a 2690

704
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
v3 that's this guy right here on the

705
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
right 12 cores 24 threads 135 watt tdp

706
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,559
that's a hot processor and i thought you

707
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
know what i'm running i put one in it

708
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
just to test to make sure i work well

709
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,760
and i was like okay that's kind of where

710
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
it's at

711
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
and then i said well

712
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,520
this is a dual

713
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
dual proc motherboard why don't i just

714
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,159
put two of these uh very power sipping

715
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
55 watt processors in there that'll be

716
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
better so i got on ebay and i bought the

717
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
2630 lv3 so now i'm going to 16 cores 32

718
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
threads and i'm like hey i'm still under

719
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,240
that tdp number

720
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
my problem that's the only number i

721
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
looked at right there i looked at coors

722
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
and and cpu frequency but i looked at

723
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
the tdp

724
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
what i didn't look at was this tiny

725
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
little t case which they have like

726
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
scroll way down on the intel arc if you

727
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
scroll all the way down you'll get to

728
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,919
this little

729
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,360
this little case

730
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,559
now your tdp obviously is

731
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,520
um

732
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,679
your max power load kind of like a rough

733
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,600
figure figuring that out your t case is

734
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,840
how much or what temperature the

735
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,520
integrated heat spreader can actually

736
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
handle and keep the cpu safe you'll

737
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
notice there's a giant difference of

738
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,400
989.9 celsius to 60.4 celsius so

739
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
i didn't even know what that was i just

740
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
went off this number and said oh this

741
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
will be great let's put that in there so

742
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,559
i rip out my big hot processor and i put

743
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,840
little power sipping ones in i'm like

744
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
this is gonna be awesome

745
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,799
i fired up i'm like okay 60.4 tk i

746
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,360
didn't know about this yet um

747
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
and this is what it looked like i'm

748
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,159
sorry these slides are really ugly

749
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,919
you'll see them better

750
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
this for this test bench i did just one

751
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
of them so i got one here one there

752
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,360
that's my cpu load you can see it's kind

753
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
of all over the place

754
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,279
graph fail i took a summarized instead

755
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,120
of individuals whoops but one thing i

756
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,559
want to really point out is notice the

757
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,840
temperature differences if you can see

758
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
them right

759
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
the temperature differences

760
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,039
is this guy this low power cannot break

761
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
60 degrees

762
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,440
so what does that do to my fan speeds

763
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
compare those and compare those so i put

764
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,039
in these power sipping processors but

765
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
since they were not designed to get as

766
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
hot my fans had to work double time

767
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,559
literally two bucks time

768
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,200
and so my fans were working harder the

769
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
cpu core count was higher but they had

770
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,720
lower

771
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
lower base clocks so they were actually

772
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
pushing harder and if you look at my

773
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,799
lovely uh graph here i got 89 watts here

774
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,679
not graph 89 watts versus 103.

775
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,760
so i literally spent all that money to

776
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
save five watts and make my server twice

777
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,158
as loud

778
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
those lasted in there for roughly a day

779
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
and i pulled them out and then i went to

780
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
the internet and like started be like

781
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,039
these processes are crap what i do no

782
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,640
i'm just a and didn't look at that

783
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
so let that be a word of warning look at

784
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
the tdp and look at your case if they're

785
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
stable up to 90 celsius your fans can

786
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,640
get away with spinning lower and and

787
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,520
letting the cpus get a little bit warmer

788
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,279
so

789
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,799
a lot of people say you know i like the

790
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
idea of something with a bunch of cores

791
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,240
tons of ram but i don't want the full

792
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
rack i don't want to go down this rabbit

793
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
hole i just want like a desktop like i

794
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,799
want a desktop that i can do this stuff

795
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,520
on

796
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
i have an answer for you and i present

797
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
to you the microatx x99 all in one

798
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,559
server now the first thing you're going

799
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,880
to see is that the x99 bass motherboards

800
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
from aliexpress and ebay

801
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
i know most of you are not most of you

802
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
anyone saw me said wait a minute in 2019

803
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,000
you said don't use these i did i did say

804
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,960
that

805
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,320
because there were tons of options and

806
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
there were enterprise options and they

807
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
were great and i'd only like had

808
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,880
experience with one and it worked and it

809
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
was fine but i just don't have that

810
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
confidence yet well

811
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
the manual has actually been translated

812
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,520
pretty well to english

813
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
shipping time still terrible they're

814
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
still awful

815
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,559
bios updates and modifications are now

816
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,080
emerging via the community there's

817
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,600
actually some github projects where

818
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,240
people are writing new bios and um ways

819
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
to interact with the bios um so you're

820
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
not just stuck with whatever it's

821
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,919
shipped with and i've built a few now on

822
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,000
the value i'll work really well

823
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
you get the same e5 v3 v4 proc ddr4

824
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,200
memory the awesome thing about these is

825
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
they will take ecc or non-ecc

826
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,919
so let's say you've got a desktop that

827
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,120
you've got some ram or some desktop

828
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,880
brand where i'm laying around you can

829
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
buy one of these motherboards

830
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,120
get yourself a zeon and put your desktop

831
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
ram in it for now until you want to buy

832
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,120
the ecc maybe you never go to ecc it's a

833
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,039
great stepping stone to start

834
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
they come in a variety of flavors like

835
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,520
as far as like the the uh peripherals

836
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
and like like the slots and what you get

837
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,039
they're all over the place kind of use

838
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
this as a guide is what you want somehow

839
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
have like an x16 slot some will have

840
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,640
like three x4 slots just depending on

841
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
what you want to do is the one you want

842
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
they're all pretty much the same they're

843
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,480
they're made by folks like machinist and

844
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
two other words i'm not going to try to

845
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
say um

846
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
because they're hard uh they're they can

847
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,520
head from 70 to 70 to 120 right now more

848
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,000
or less they used to be 40 to 90 but

849
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
unfortunately prices have gone up a

850
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,399
little bit

851
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,279
um

852
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,640
if we're going to take a little pause

853
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
from um

854
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
home lab thought if you have a if you

855
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,320
want to make a gaming rig for

856
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
like a friend or a child or something

857
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,559
this isn't a bad option

858
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
especially when you get to the um

859
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,919
especially when you get into the

860
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,200
processes we're gonna get to in just a

861
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,159
bit

862
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,760
on that note one things they don't have

863
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
one thing they don't have is they don't

864
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
have any out of band management or ilo

865
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,559
two cool projects to hang out or to

866
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,360
check out are the pi kvm and test pilot

867
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
basically network-based kvm that can

868
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,279
build on raspberry pi it's a great way

869
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,640
to get out of band management on a

870
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,159
motherboard that was never built for it

871
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,600
and it's super flexible you know put it

872
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,799
on one server move to the other one it's

873
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
not tied to anything and you can do that

874
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,320
for less than a hundred dollars versus

875
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
buying a network-based kvm if you ever

876
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,240
bought one of those another cool tool is

877
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
an iod and i'm probably saying that's

878
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,200
wrong it's probably like iodd because

879
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,399
based on what it does has anyone ever

880
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
heard of these an iod device

881
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
they're amazing right

882
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
here's mine right here what it is it's

883
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
just a driving closure that you put your

884
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
own hard drive in there and it has a

885
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
folder that's called underscore iso you

886
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,279
drop every iso you like into that folder

887
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,720
and when you plug it in there it

888
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
emulates a virtual disk drive of that

889
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,039
iso so if you're selling an operating

890
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
system you just go through your scroll

891
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
through your options of the iso you've

892
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
got in there hit ok plug it in it's like

893
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
you just put the disc into the machine

894
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
so no more building flash drives to

895
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
install from super handy these are about

896
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
100 bucks they're great to have

897
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,520
and i don't work for them at all i just

898
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,399
like them

899
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,279
they're great i like sharing my toys

900
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,080
um talking about x99 motherboard builds

901
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
the reason i bring this up is because

902
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
you can get yourself a 6 core 12 thread

903
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
box with 64 gig cc ram

904
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,200
for 289 dollars

905
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,440
how do you touch that in a desktop right

906
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,399
um

907
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,840
it's totally unheard of obviously you

908
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360
need a case and you need a power supply

909
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
of course but likely you've got an old

910
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
atx box laying around this takes just

911
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
off the shelf atx case micro utx if you

912
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
wanted a little smaller um

913
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
generic run of the world power supply so

914
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
that's all it takes if you want to go

915
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,679
really big 12 core 24 thread um and 120

916
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,799
gigs of ecc ram under 500

917
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,120
you could do a lot of stuff with that

918
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,799
box alone if you want to like nest your

919
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,559
home lab and say here's my home labs

920
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,919
virtualization platform and then i've

921
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,039
got sub home labs that are nested in it

922
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,240
now

923
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,799
here's me in 2019 i'm not making fun of

924
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,640
him but myself this is literally me well

925
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,919
what about software support that

926
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,360
probably won't work

927
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,159
well

928
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,919
esxi likes it

929
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,240
windows seems to like it proxmox runs

930
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
great regular ubuntu shelves great i did

931
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
obviously have to put a network card in

932
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
there because it has a real tech

933
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,760
ethernet so you have to put a one that

934
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
has supported drivers or inject your

935
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,279
driver into esxi if you want

936
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,399
but

937
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,919
you know i've done a bunch of them and

938
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,559
they're great i i wanted to hate on them

939
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,399
and i really did and i was a hater but i

940
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
am strong enough to say i was wrong and

941
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,240
if you want a solid home lab for on the

942
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
cheap and have it quiet in a desktop

943
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,720
case you definitely have an option

944
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,799
if you wanted to go a little bit higher

945
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,720
a little bit more robust the super micro

946
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,799
x10s are around still you'll get double

947
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,279
your memory capacity you'll get far more

948
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,279
robust in your pci express slots all

949
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,320
sorts of

950
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,240
options there for you

951
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,000
these can be had in a regular atx form

952
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
factor so you can fit them in a regular

953
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,120
desktop case they do have the out of

954
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
bound management built in

955
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,360
but

956
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,240
they're 275 dollars so

957
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,159
you know it's a trade-off do you want to

958
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,240
roll the dice and and build the cheaper

959
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
aliexpress style or do you want to build

960
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,120
one of those choices yours they're both

961
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,159
great

962
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
um talking about good value processors

963
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
here's my list for 2021 of the ones i

964
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,679
like

965
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,080
um that's not a typo that processor is

966
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,000
14.

967
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,279
it's a 2620 v3 six cores 12 threads 85

968
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,720
watts

969
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
and the t case on these ones vary but

970
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,080
since they're going in a desktop case

971
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,000
you can put put a big ol

972
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,760
cpu cooler on there air you need to do a

973
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
liquid one because these are just

974
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,399
2011 v3s so you mount those just be

975
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,760
careful if you're if you do a super

976
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,880
micro

977
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
dual slot board you're gonna have to do

978
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
a narrow ilem if you do a regular be a

979
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
square ilm and you can come talk to me

980
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
about that after if you want um but yeah

981
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,159
your processors are not the expensive

982
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,399
part of these builds we're talking 14 up

983
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
to 85 just depending on what you want

984
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
it's choose your own adventure at this

985
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
point

986
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,799
um

987
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,799
and the and these will go based on um

988
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,799
the power draw i've got a 2690 v3 in

989
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,279
um in that chinese motherboard and the

990
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
and the power seems to be fine with it

991
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,519
pushing that 135 watt proc so so far so

992
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,960
good on there

993
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,120
let's talk networking i love talking

994
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
networking um

995
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,960
these are these the network core

996
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,559
switches and stuff for this year that

997
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,720
i'd like to go with first is a ruckus

998
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,960
7150-c12p

999
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,600
you get yourself two sfv sfp plus ports

1000
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,840
for 10 gig and you get 12 copper one gig

1001
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
ports which do poe plus

1002
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
solid solid core if you if you're not

1003
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,000
looking for a ton of ports great place

1004
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
to a great place to get one they can be

1005
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,679
had from anywhere from 140 to 300 um

1006
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,399
closer to 300 now the 140 price we

1007
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,000
actually on the utah helms discord we

1008
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
actually did a group buy and bought i

1009
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,720
think well they're all right there

1010
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
that's the picture of them

1011
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
me updating them that was me um we all

1012
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
bought those together and then we drove

1013
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
them up to each other it's been great

1014
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,440
they're super fantastic we've got some

1015
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
folks that have deployed them outside um

1016
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,200
covered obviously but they're handling

1017
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,559
the heat just fine

1018
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,919
uh the next one if you want the kind of

1019
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,840
a bigger core is your brocade

1020
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,399
icx6610-48p 48 ports of one gig poe plus

1021
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,159
and eight ports of 10 gig in an sfp plus

1022
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
it was about 180 right now great core i

1023
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,799
run that myself it's been absolutely

1024
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
flawless one thing you do need to keep

1025
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
in mind with it is it likes its power

1026
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
clean meaning if you've got a modified

1027
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,600
sine wave ups and it clicks over to it

1028
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,960
there's a good chance your switch will

1029
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
reboot

1030
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
you you could maybe try a power

1031
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,159
conditioner i ended up having to get a

1032
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,640
more of a rack mount pure sine wave

1033
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,799
ups to keep mine from rebooting

1034
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,840
now you're gonna say well why don't you

1035
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,600
just have both power supplies plugged in

1036
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,880
one into house power one into the

1037
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,519
battery power in my experience any time

1038
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,440
that battery flicker or the ups

1039
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
flickered to test itself you know how

1040
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,760
these sometimes will just kind of

1041
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,720
quietly

1042
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,679
on you

1043
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,600
my switch would reboot and so i'd be in

1044
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,480
the middle of doing something i'd hear

1045
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
that little click and i'd be like uh-oh

1046
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,679
and i'd listen very carefully and for

1047
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,960
very faintly all the fans spinning the

1048
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,600
basement like oh switch is rebooting and

1049
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,519
that's about a 10 minute reboot so

1050
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,240
that's super fun let me tell you

1051
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
now if you don't want to go the

1052
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,760
enterprise x the x enterprise used gear

1053
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
that's totally cool this micro tick

1054
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,519
right here that i've got listed 24 ports

1055
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,720
of one gig it's not poe however you can

1056
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,359
power it via poe which is kind of cool

1057
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,560
it's actually number one port will

1058
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
actually take a poe in

1059
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
um i think it's number one port it might

1060
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
be it's labeled it'll actually take poe

1061
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,960
in so you could power it from an

1062
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,879
injector or you could power it from

1063
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
another switch if you want to use a

1064
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,879
digital switch it does have two 10 gig

1065
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,359
sfp plus ports which is great and it's

1066
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,760
super simple for like folks that really

1067
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,199
aren't like into networking day in day

1068
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,280
out it's a gui driven there's a command

1069
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
line but it's gooey driven

1070
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
super easy to figure out like honestly i

1071
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,639
i had never seen one and within like

1072
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
five ten minutes i was like oh this is

1073
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,839
easy enough and got that all built up

1074
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,480
vlans uh link aggregation all that cool

1075
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
stuff so those are some good options and

1076
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,879
they're 110 to 130 on amazon you can buy

1077
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,918
those today and they're pretty fantastic

1078
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,320
as far as network cards go um these are

1079
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,918
pretty much kind of the tried and true

1080
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
everyone loves these ones

1081
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,440
and i'm not going to say go buy one or

1082
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
over the other make sure it there's

1083
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,880
drivers for your operating system that

1084
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
you're going to put it in but honestly

1085
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
get what you can get right now

1086
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,280
whatever's on a good deal whatever looks

1087
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,079
good

1088
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,760
great go ahead and grab that

1089
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
it's just there's not enough

1090
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,599
differentium differences in them in kind

1091
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
of the use case that i have that i've

1092
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,359
had a big reason to like say we'll only

1093
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,440
buy these or only buy those um get what

1094
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
you can get on that case

1095
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,280
um dax and fiber have been completely

1096
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
unaffected by all this i don't know why

1097
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,320
like you can go on fsf.com today and buy

1098
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
yourself like 400 transceivers they're

1099
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,240
all there i don't know they have not

1100
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,359
been

1101
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,079
touched for whatever reason

1102
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,839
storage we're going to talk a word about

1103
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,160
hbas our favorite um my favorite but

1104
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,359
something that anyone who's going to do

1105
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,640
any type of data hoarding is going to

1106
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720
use is an hba and that's how you're

1107
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
going to basically connect all of your

1108
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
drives into your motherboard um

1109
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,839
these are the options and these prices

1110
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
are updated for this year and that's

1111
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
about what you can get them for now

1112
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,119
pretty much anything sas 308 based is

1113
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,839
going to be great these are kind of the

1114
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:57,840
specific uh

1115
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,040
[Music]

1116
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
kind of generic lsi flavors of those

1117
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
um those are the prices they're running

1118
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,040
at you can get them they'll be great

1119
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
a word of warning

1120
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,480
hbas need to dissipate 10 to 15 watts of

1121
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,359
heat

1122
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,599
a lot of folks myself included have put

1123
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,599
an hba in a desktop box without adequate

1124
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,920
airflow through it and really weird

1125
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,520
stuff starts happening you'll start

1126
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
getting random drivers you can get cr

1127
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,560
data corruption and then one day your

1128
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,920
machine will boot and you have no hard

1129
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,040
drives

1130
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
and that's happened to several of us

1131
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
that have worked on this so make sure

1132
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
you can get some some air moving across

1133
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,280
that

1134
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
and it doesn't have to be fancy it

1135
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,599
doesn't have to be a ton just get some

1136
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,119
air moving across if they just sit and

1137
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,200
soak in a small small area or something

1138
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,960
with bad cooling you're gonna have a bad

1139
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,079
time um i was asked about specifically

1140
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,520
talking about like back planes and

1141
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,160
connectors and can like what goes what

1142
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,760
so this is a visual representation of

1143
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,359
what they look like as far as you can

1144
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,400
tell the difference if you're looking at

1145
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,200
it the way i like to do it

1146
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,880
sat it into sass so was that a hard

1147
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,599
drive into sass you bet your ass

1148
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,280
sass into sata you don't get your data

1149
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,119
i literally made that up today i hope

1150
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
it's okay uh but yeah that's how i

1151
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,800
remember it now

1152
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,599
um

1153
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,280
take it use it spread it spread the good

1154
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,240
word

1155
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
a lot of folks talk about back planes

1156
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,880
and what the connections look like and

1157
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
how they are the easy rule of thumb now

1158
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,160
this isn't always accurate there's a

1159
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,200
rule of thumb but most most cases if

1160
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,359
it's a sas six gig it's going to be the

1161
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,839
8087 or the 8088 if you're doing

1162
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,160
internal external if it's a 12 it's

1163
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,440
going to be the 8643 or the 8644

1164
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
the easy way to remember it

1165
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,079
six is a rectangle 12 is a square

1166
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
that's kind of the easy way to remember

1167
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,160
there are some newer um some of the late

1168
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
edition of the sas 6 gigabit per second

1169
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
cables were the squares the the 8643s

1170
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,720
but that's kind of the easy way to to

1171
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
remember it

1172
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,520
of course if you don't want to actually

1173
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,119
use a backplane you can do breakouts for

1174
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,200
either you know um go from here to

1175
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
individual satas a lot of folks do this

1176
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,560
and it works just fine you can find

1177
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,160
those at any

1178
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
um

1179
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
any cable place that you want to get

1180
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,079
them they're they're easy they work well

1181
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,160
um talking about the back plane you kind

1182
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,240
of say well what does my backplane need

1183
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,200
it really depends on which

1184
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,839
manufacturer your back plane is super

1185
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,520
micro is awesome if you click on that

1186
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,720
link and this will be in the slide deck

1187
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,079
of course that'll take you to the

1188
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,440
documentation on the back planes it'll

1189
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,280
tell you what their

1190
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,640
features are what their capabilities are

1191
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,480
what kind of connections they need

1192
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,359
it's all right there super well

1193
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,720
and the power can usually be an old

1194
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
school molex or it could be something

1195
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,680
proprietary something hanging off the

1196
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,400
board

1197
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,599
just be careful when you're out there

1198
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,920
buying if you're buying a generic case

1199
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,440
and putting a different motherboard in

1200
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,400
it that's where you're going to kind of

1201
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
run into issues but if you're buying

1202
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,760
something that's kind of like built as a

1203
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,839
storage node

1204
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,200
it's going to be all connected anyway

1205
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,079
and it's all going in you're not going

1206
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,359
to really have to worry about it unless

1207
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,800
you have to replace your hba in which

1208
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,680
case you're just kind of looking at the

1209
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
end going oh i need one that has that

1210
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,280
end on it okay

1211
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
storage this has turned fun

1212
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,160
thanks to chia storage is hard and

1213
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,640
painful but it's still here if you want

1214
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,520
to go the speedy fast ssd nvme route the

1215
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,839
p3600 and p3605 mwah are beautiful

1216
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,320
400 gig to 2 terabyte capacities

1217
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,640
fantastic ride endurance you will have a

1218
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,400
hard time murdering those drives

1219
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
like you can like don't try but they'll

1220
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
go for a long long time like we're

1221
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,160
talking

1222
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,040
literally like double triple the triple

1223
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,520
the right endurance of our um our sata

1224
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,839
friends as far as the sata side goes i

1225
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,240
like the s 3500 still those are current

1226
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,960
prices so 480 gigs are about 40 bucks

1227
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
and then 1.6 will run you about 150 and

1228
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,640
those will just be

1229
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,880
regular sata

1230
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
as i said earlier with your hard drives

1231
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,760
there's still the easy store the

1232
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,280
elements the my books the shucking these

1233
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
are your best bet to get the cheapest

1234
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
spinning storage you get

1235
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
one website i do want to point you to is

1236
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
shocks.top that tracks all the ones that

1237
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,680
are easily shuckable and easily usable

1238
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,800
and it'll actually give you kind of a

1239
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
buying guide on whether it's a good deal

1240
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
or not a good deal or to hold off so

1241
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,320
check in on that as you're um as you're

1242
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
looking for those if you want to go the

1243
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
sas route cool those drives are starting

1244
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,760
to come out even when not come out those

1245
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,800
drivers are still

1246
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
available-ish

1247
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,079
you have to have a sas backplane

1248
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,240
obviously or a sas connector um if you

1249
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,160
go to bitdeals.tech they are selling

1250
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,599
those right now eight terabyte sales

1251
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,880
drives for 100

1252
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
so you can pick those up not too bad

1253
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
now

1254
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,839
remember when i said earlier in the

1255
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,960
presentation that we're going to talk

1256
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
about some kind of more the the bigger

1257
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,800
stronger big storage chassis and i said

1258
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,119
the csc846s are ridiculously expensive

1259
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,000
now

1260
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,400
i do have two options for my friends

1261
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,280
here

1262
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
um this is the cse 836 the super mario

1263
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,119
this is a little cousin of it it is

1264
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,560
still on the v2 so you're gonna be with

1265
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
ddr3 memory in this case

1266
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,800
but this is fully kitted out for cell

1267
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,760
right now

1268
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,240
um twin 2620 v2s uh 32 gigs of ram it

1269
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
does have a dual port sfp plus in a 10

1270
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
gig 10 gig nick with sp plus two 920

1271
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,800
watt platinum uh super micro power

1272
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,760
supplies

1273
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,240
16 bay 3.5 inch shipped 500 right now

1274
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,040
and

1275
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,960
if you want to know where to buy it it's

1276
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
the same place as this

1277
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
the second is a brand new and when i say

1278
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,079
brand new like i've been working this

1279
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,599
presentation for a while now

1280
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,440
like literally testing on this was going

1281
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,800
on last night

1282
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,319
so this is fresh off the fresh off the

1283
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
home lab research um it's the

1284
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,079
do-it-yourself setup you bring your own

1285
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,240
e5 v3 or v4 cpu it has two 10 gig nics

1286
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,520
has the very versatile sas 3008 hba

1287
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
redone at 700 watt power supplies 12 3.5

1288
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
inch

1289
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,359
slash sata

1290
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,800
and you can see kind of the way that

1291
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,720
they're arranged it's a 1u that you

1292
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
actually slide the cover off and you set

1293
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,599
them down in it kind of cool

1294
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,520
and has four 2.5 inch ssd hot swaps up

1295
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,119
front so if you want to do some cash on

1296
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
there on the front and have your

1297
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,480
spinning storage a little bit farther in

1298
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,000
that and have it all in one and it's 200

1299
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,599
right now

1300
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,119
what they look like right now and thanks

1301
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,280
to vortex for doing this for me um this

1302
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,400
is what it looks like

1303
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,359
so

1304
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
there's your drive caddies there you got

1305
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,000
your cpus and memory in the back

1306
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
the little removable caddies are

1307
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,400
actually kind of nifty to pop those out

1308
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
as far as

1309
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,359
booting up put it we put cpu and ram in

1310
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,800
there it works fine got to the bios so

1311
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
it looks like they'll work just fine for

1312
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
if you wanted to build a cool zfs box or

1313
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,880
or any kind of mass storage box they're

1314
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
pretty sweet there

1315
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,040
uh this is bash ninja's box i helped him

1316
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,640
i sent him this price list you could fit

1317
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
through it um this is sitting in a super

1318
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,960
micro x8 1u case so old old

1319
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
garbage case not garbage case old box

1320
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,040
here's an old box we did retrofit it

1321
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,480
with a micro atx aliexpress motherboard

1322
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,359
that is a um

1323
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,560
a 10 gig

1324
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,119
uh network card right there and he's

1325
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,119
just got his ssd hanging out there

1326
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,359
fitting in a 1u little low profile of

1327
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,800
that we'll have that build available as

1328
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,000
well if you want to kind of build

1329
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
something small and light in a one new

1330
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
form factor

1331
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,640
uh next one that a good friend chucker j

1332
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,760
built he is a support engineer

1333
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
um he was replaced he did want to run

1334
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,839
all the desktops he had he i need mass

1335
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,359
somewhere like four or five desktops for

1336
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,680
his actual um compute work he's a

1337
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
support engineer so he's really tasked

1338
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,440
with bringing in a lot of like customer

1339
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
info or like or duplicating customer

1340
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,200
issues rather like we're on this version

1341
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,560
of this software doing this that and the

1342
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,079
other we need to build that and and so

1343
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,240
we can test stuff um the cool thing

1344
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,359
about his

1345
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,720
is i don't know if you can see it very

1346
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
well that he's got 32 vms running on

1347
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,079
this guy

1348
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,880
and in a box that has

1349
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,319
um 256 gigs of ram he's this is a v2 but

1350
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
he's got two of those p3605s i told you

1351
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,200
about so he's got twin of those ssds and

1352
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,960
it's sitting in a very attractive just

1353
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
atx box sitting on his desk totally

1354
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,280
quiet runs all day he's happy to claim

1355
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,079
with it

1356
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,160
so kind of some cool stuff that other

1357
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,359
homelanders have been doing kind of give

1358
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,200
you some ideas on on what's been helpful

1359
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,760
for them that if you look in that top

1360
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,200
corner there that's actually that micro

1361
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,160
tick

1362
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,280
switch i referenced a little bit earlier

1363
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,440
so coming full circle some resources to

1364
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,200
follow and contribute to as we learn and

1365
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
pay this forward serve the home the

1366
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,119
buyer's guide and forums great resource

1367
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,480
a lot of folks doing some cool stuff

1368
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,119
there um reddit the homelab group the

1369
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,760
data hoarders super great

1370
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,000
i do google image search a lot basically

1371
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,480
it's like sff887 yup okay that's what

1372
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,760
that looks like you know

1373
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,079
um obviously youtube if anyone wants to

1374
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,240
join the utah discord for utah home labs

1375
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
that's right there if you don't want to

1376
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,200
scan the qr code i get it there's the

1377
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,680
url to type it out manually

1378
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,040
and with that

1379
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,079
i'll leave it on there so everyone can

1380
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,920
get it do we have any questions that

1381
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,480
you'd like to ask me or things that i've

1382
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,400
not gone well over

1383
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
yeah

1384
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,920
hmm

1385
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,240
the so the question is using basically a

1386
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
notebook and using the the m.2 nvmes and

1387
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,960
expanding that out to something else pci

1388
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,839
because it's pci express

1389
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,359
just notch it out yeah

1390
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,359
okay so the closest i've done to that i

1391
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,640
haven't done that specifically but the

1392
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,440
closest i have i have gone from the m.2

1393
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,520
out to a um u.2 adapter so i have i've

1394
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
gone to m.2 to ut2 that works perfectly

1395
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,240
i've never done one of those what you're

1396
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,880
describing but i want to now because

1397
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,760
that sounds pretty cool um one thing on

1398
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,040
the back of this on the bottom of this

1399
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,079
guy

1400
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,160
that is an m.2

1401
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,440
so you could actually expand this out

1402
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,760
with this guy being your head node right

1403
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,720
so

1404
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,160
awesome question i wish i had an answer

1405
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
that i've done it but something we

1406
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,440
absolutely will discuss and look at

1407
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,599
that'd be super cool

1408
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,000
any other questions

1409
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,880
that's a fantastic question question is

1410
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,800
how do you separate home prod from home

1411
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,280
lab and there's tons of ways to uh tons

1412
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,920
of ways of doing it um me personally

1413
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,079
what i've found been the best for me

1414
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,280
is i run i consider the actual bare

1415
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760
metal as my home prod and so that box

1416
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,640
that i that that gigabyte box the

1417
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,880
the dual v3s that i've got that actually

1418
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,640
is running esxi

1419
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,599
and then my home lab is nested within it

1420
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,079
and so my home prod my my core bare

1421
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,160
metal running esxi has got my

1422
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,839
my home prod boxes they're they're

1423
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,520
actually running like the vms that are

1424
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,599
running the home automation

1425
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,280
uh media servers backup servers all that

1426
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,040
good stuff and then what i've done is i

1427
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
install either another virtualization

1428
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,200
hypervisor or like a container something

1429
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,880
to run containers on or something within

1430
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
it as a vm so then i just nest my home

1431
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,400
lab within prod by doing that i can make

1432
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
it break it crash it mess with all these

1433
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,920
vms that are nested in and i never break

1434
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,400
my prod the other cool thing is you're

1435
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
not really dependent on fancy switches

1436
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,079
and networking and stuff because it's

1437
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,160
all virtual right so if you want to do

1438
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,400
some cool distributed switches and

1439
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,000
you're talking memory speeds at that

1440
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,079
point because you're never hitting wires

1441
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,800
right so mine is i do a i do a nested

1442
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,559
method where i've got my prod one and

1443
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,480
then i nest my lab underneath it that's

1444
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,000
how i do it

1445
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,160
uh for some people like to go with like

1446
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,760
if you're running a media server they

1447
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,440
want that physical so they can take care

1448
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,880
or take advantage of quick sync and all

1449
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,720
that stuff that's one way to do it

1450
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,760
that's kind of one of the things i

1451
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,839
brought up with those little low power

1452
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,839
boxes that i like to use those make good

1453
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
home prod stuff say hey this little box

1454
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,440
just does this and that's where it lives

1455
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,160
i used to virtualize my um my main

1456
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,599
router my open sense router i used to

1457
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,599
have virtualized but the trouble i ran

1458
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,520
into is if for whatever reason i wasn't

1459
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
available and someone was at my house

1460
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,119
and wanted to reboot it it's a lot

1461
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,880
easier to say hey you see that black box

1462
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,000
that's plugged in there just unplug that

1463
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
and plug that back in versus okay first

1464
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,960
what you need to do is log into my

1465
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,480
hypervisor and once you get to the

1466
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
hypervisor find the open sense okay go

1467
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,520
ahead and reboot that after logging into

1468
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,200
that right so

1469
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,079
i i

1470
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,000
typically like to run a physical edge

1471
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
firewall now um because that reason also

1472
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,480
if i happen to break my virtualization i

1473
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,000
lose the internet which is kind of a

1474
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,079
pain

1475
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,200
any other questions

1476
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,439
yes

1477
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,079
so i guess it really comes down to

1478
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,440
if preferred is like which one do you

1479
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,480
want to learn or which one do you want

1480
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,800
to like use long term right so if you're

1481
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,559
like if let's say you're an esxi shop or

1482
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,839
you're a vmware shop at um at work i'd

1483
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,280
say you're on esx so you're actually

1484
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,440
running it at home um if you want to

1485
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,040
have all the bells and whistles and all

1486
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
the good stuff that uh that you get at

1487
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,119
work you can sign up for vmug advantage

1488
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,359
that's 200 a year from vmware and you

1489
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,200
get everything they have it's literally

1490
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,559
an all-you-can-eat buffet of vmware

1491
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,720
goodness and so there was a time when i

1492
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,319
actually ran vsan at my home

1493
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,640
hyper-converged and then i realized how

1494
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,880
terribly expensive that was and painful

1495
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,280
so i did do that um if you're looking

1496
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,240
just like

1497
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,839
just like i want to get my feet wet and

1498
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,520
and and kind of have the free

1499
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,720
alternative i don't really care too much

1500
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,520
about vmware proxmox is a great option

1501
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,319
a lot of folks um really like unraid

1502
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,079
onraid's very popular and a lot of folks

1503
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,160
run that i've run in the past as a test

1504
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
and and that's good um one thing that's

1505
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,599
coming down the pipeline that's been

1506
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,200
that i'm really excited for is truenas

1507
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,160
scale

1508
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,440
and what that's going to give us is

1509
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
that's going to give us build out nas

1510
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,440
in a hyper-converged solution where

1511
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,520
actually our storage our zfs storage can

1512
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,680
scale out as we add nodes and it will

1513
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,559
actually host containers and vms and

1514
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,720
jails and all that so that's super cool

1515
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,359
coming down the pipe too

1516
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,559
and slides are going to be on the on the

1517
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,400
sketch link after

1518
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,000
and then just uh i'll have there and

1519
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,400
also have the um the google spreadsheet

1520
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,839
with all the stuff like the links being

1521
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:08,880
by it

1522
