1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,360
okay so my name is Gabrielle and today

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,160
I'm going to talk about threat hunting

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,020
and cloud-based environments

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,279
so just a quick table of contents so you

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,199
know what you're getting into I'm gonna

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,720
do a quick introduction go a little bit

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,420
into threat hunting 101 talk about the

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,040
cloud very briefly and then talk about

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,260
some multi-cloud considerations and

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,519
things along those lines

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
so as far as an introduction why am I

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,940
here

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,280
um I get all set a lot my name is

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,260
Gabrielle I have been in the information

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,180
security field for a little bit now

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,860
started out doing medical device

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,039
security and vulnerabilities and kind of

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,840
did a lot of stuff from there so I did

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,520
some vulnerability management I worked

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,699
as a cloud security engineer at a

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,140
company that used five different cloud

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,760
service providers so it got really well

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,000
versed in that and then um

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,860
currently work as an SE for netwitness

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,220
so

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
I wanted to start off with a quote uh

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,840
mostly because I wanted to use this cool

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
quote slide template but this is from a

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
good friend of mine Dr Eugene spafford

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
he said that a system is good if it does

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
what it's supposed to do insecure if it

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
doesn't do anything else and that always

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,680
comes back to me I always end up

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,119
thinking about that and

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,680
thinking about how true it is especially

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,520
while threat hunting

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,200
all right so threat hunting 101 with a

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,540
quote from Liam Neeson because it

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,079
belongs there

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,600
so what is threat hunting threat hunting

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
is a proactive opportunity for an

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
organization to uncover attacker

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,899
presence in their environments it's an

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,399
intelligence driven analysis to

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,140
determine if and when attackers have

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,360
gained access to their resources

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,979
attackers can evade detections and

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,500
bypass alarms sometimes so hunting is an

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
important addition to any security

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,038
program

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,479
there are a few different types of

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,760
threat hunting you can do structured

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
threat hunting which is a little bit

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,560
more formal

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,140
to search for attackers and tactics that

57
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,060
are specifically used by them you can

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,500
also do unstructured threat hunting

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,340
which is a little bit more free flowing

60
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,900
it's a little bit more ad hoc they tend

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,760
to be a little opportunistic and they

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
can be a lot harder for newer

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
organizations and newer programs that

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,140
are trying to build their threat hunting

65
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,819
capabilities

66
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,800
they're also a situational and entity

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,020
driven which are a lot of times when you

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,980
find something and you're like okay

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,780
we're gonna look more into this and it

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,580
turns into threat hunting

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,459
so across those three different types of

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,140
threat hunting there are a few different

73
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,060
ways to go about it um there's

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,739
intelligence-based threat hunting which

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,140
is a little bit more reactive it's a

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,300
hunting model that uses iocs from threat

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,760
intelligence resources or sources and

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,739
from there the hunt follows predefined

79
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,620
rules established by your security tools

80
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,860
and threat intelligence that you have

81
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,080
a lot of times these intelligence-based

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,140
hunts they'll use iocs hash values IP

83
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,500
addresses domain names networks or host

84
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
artifacts that are provided by

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,819
intelligence sharing platforms

86
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,620
on the other hand there's hypothesis

87
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,319
hunting which is proactive and it uses a

88
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,080
threat hunting Library so a lot of times

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,760
organizations will align with miter

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,860
attack Frameworks and stuff like that

91
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,900
and use Global detection playbooks so

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,700
that they can identify advanced

93
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,379
persistent threat groups and malware

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,640
attacks

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,940
hypothesis based hunts use ttps and

96
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,819
things like that from attackers

97
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,980
there's also some custom hunting you can

98
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,720
kind of do a hybrid of those things if

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,580
you want to once you get really good at

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,500
what you're doing based on situational

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,420
awareness and Industry

102
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,060
base hunting methodologies so it'll

103
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,000
identify anomalies in Sim and EDR tools

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
and you can customize

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,659
what you're looking for based on

106
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,519
customer requirements

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
so a lot of the custom situational hunts

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
are based on those customer requirements

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,459
or they're proactively executed based on

110
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,860
situations so if you're looking for

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,320
something related to geopolitical issues

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,620
or targeted specifically attacks

113
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,440
these hunting activities can draw on

114
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,479
both Intel and hypothesis based

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,479
methodologies

116
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,400
so a hypothesis driven cycle is

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,259
oftentimes a lot easier to start with

118
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,060
for organizations because it allows you

119
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,040
to kind of work through a specific

120
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,199
process and

121
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,540
just go through the the steps that kind

122
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,160
of allow you to learn the threat hunting

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,300
process

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,419
so with a hypothesis driven cycle we

125
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,220
would start with visibility so that's

126
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,460
where you're successful hunt begins if

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,680
you have really limited visibility it's

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,300
going to skew your data and it's going

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
to instill a lot less confidence in your

130
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,479
results

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,580
ways that you can improve visibility can

132
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,740
be as simple as deploying EDR agents

133
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,100
Network visibility AIDS aggregating logs

134
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,080
things along those lines

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,120
to further this developing a robust

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,100
pipeline that enriches data is extremely

137
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,139
helpful it includes things like

138
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,360
geolocation data parsing and

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
standardization and using threat

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,500
intelligence feeds

141
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
intelligence analysis is your next phase

142
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
that you're going to want to focus on

143
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,080
this is when the hunt Team Works to

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
identify potential threats in the

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,199
environment and works with key

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,820
stakeholders to better understand the

147
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,180
scope and environment of the hunt

148
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,400
so a lot of times this is when you'll

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,500
use an attacker methodology like miter

150
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,199
attack to Aid in TTP research and

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,240
develop critical system lists and

152
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,460
diagrams that can be helpful during this

153
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,960
stage

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
hypothesis formation is the third step

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,100
that is when you're going to develop

156
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,259
hypotheses targeting activities that

157
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,060
threat actors might perform in the

158
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,680
environment and they can be used to

159
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,660
guide the behaviors that the team looks

160
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,419
for during an engagement

161
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,940
analytic creation is when your team is

162
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,500
going to develop specific queries or

163
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,120
analytics to identify the targeted

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,460
threat Behavior based on the parameters

165
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,280
set in those previous steps

166
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,039
execution is the fun part it's when the

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,860
hunt team executes their test cases and

168
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,360
retrieves results for the follow-on

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,860
analysis

170
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,900
and then finally investigation and

171
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,639
invalidation

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,620
um determine whether identified activity

173
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,199
is malicious so this is one of the steps

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,940
where visibility preparation will really

175
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,979
pay off if it's done thoroughly

176
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,600
it'll also lead into increasing

177
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,880
efficiency and detection rates

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,919
any true detection will also likely be

179
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,380
turned into an actual investigation at

180
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,860
that stage

181
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,220
all right so some key threats that a lot

182
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,720
of times we're looking for that we see

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
during threat hunting

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,300
um 90 of cyber attacks are initiated via

185
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,759
fishing this is when I'm sure everyone

186
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,860
knows this but when email is used as an

187
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,600
attack Vector to inject malicious code

188
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,479
or divert a user to a phony site or

189
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,520
false site to harvest credentials things

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,800
along those lines ransomware is another

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
top threat here

192
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,600
um it's obviously in the news constantly

193
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,639
it's uh ransomware as a service is also

194
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,440
becoming a really really big

195
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,539
things so it's a lot more accessible to

196
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,099
groups that might not have been able to

197
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,199
use ransomware otherwise

198
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,180
nation state actors are attackers that

199
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,860
are often motivated motivated by

200
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,319
politics and nationalism based on the

201
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
political landscape we will see more or

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
less of those

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
and finally Insider threats is

204
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
continually being talked about more and

205
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
more it's a lot of times when people are

206
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,319
using their authorized access or

207
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,819
knowledge of an organization to harm

208
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,380
that organization

209
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,120
so something that you might not see on

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,699
this is misconfiguration a lot of things

211
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,639
along those lines thought

212
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,800
contribute to the vulnerabilities in

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Cloud environments because I would say

214
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,199
that when you look at a cloud

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
environment you're number one

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,120
issue is going to be misconfiguration or

217
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,919
something along those lines

218
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
but that kind of takes us into

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,360
one is a threat of threat so when we're

220
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
threat hunting we are looking for

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
a very specific thread so much like a

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,460
crime a threat has very clear parameters

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,560
in uh to meet in order to be considered

224
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
as such so

225
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
very similar to what you might see in

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
criminal justice means motive and

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,539
opportunity is what makes up a crime and

228
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,219
it's also similar to what makes up a

229
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,620
threat so means is your way to commit

230
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,839
the crime or do whatever you're trying

231
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,479
to do motive is your reason why you're

232
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,919
going after what you're going after why

233
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,539
you're doing what you're doing an

234
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,520
opportunity is your chance to commit the

235
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,199
crime your chance to infiltrate whatever

236
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,640
all right and then the hunt the hunt

237
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
needs a plan I mean we went through that

238
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,240
methodology really quickly that just

239
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,740
kind of outlined what a hypothesis

240
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,860
driven plan would look like and

241
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,660
all hunts need to have some sort of plan

242
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
so your purpose what are you doing

243
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,459
your location where are you doing it

244
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,899
your scope is really important when

245
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:10,920
you're threat hunting because it's

246
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,540
really easy to get overwhelmed with

247
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,399
everything that you're seeing and then

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,959
finally your outcomes what do you want

249
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,060
to find you don't want confirmation by

250
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,980
us here but you do want an expectation

251
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,959
of what you're specifically looking for

252
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
all right now on to the cloud

253
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,180
it really is just someone else's

254
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,519
computer so how does threat hunting

255
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,040
change in cloud-based environments it is

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
estimated that 50 of the world's data

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,580
will be stored in Cloud infrastructure

258
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,740
by 2025. that is 100 zettabytes give or

259
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,140
take a little bit of data across public

260
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,839
clouds government clouds private clouds

261
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,940
and just cloud storage providers in

262
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,120
general

263
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,940
this is the meme that I always think of

264
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,500
when I think about the cloud just

265
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,880
because these guys are my favorite from

266
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,279
Toy Story so oh the cloud

267
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,620
all right so your key differences

268
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,360
between Cloud environments and on-prem

269
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
environments are going to lie in how

270
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,700
information is obtained and analyzed and

271
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,860
the response mechanisms and tools that

272
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,200
are used those are often very different

273
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,700
in cloud-based environments

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,100
also when you're working in Cloud

275
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,839
environments there are three fundamental

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,700
truths three fundamental precepts that

277
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,279
you want to keep in mind so just because

278
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,320
an organization is in the cloud does not

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
mean attackers stop I don't know how

280
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,519
many times I have seen people think that

281
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,260
for some reason putting things into a

282
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,580
cloud is like putting them in a safe

283
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,100
somewhere but that's not the case

284
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,480
um I would say honestly in today's

285
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,820
landscape you could be attracting more

286
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,380
attackers when it comes to Cloud just

287
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,579
based on how terrible your

288
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,120
misconfigurations are so number one

289
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,579
number two it is really beneficial to

290
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,920
your defense strategy strategy to

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,779
understand

292
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,100
adversaries objectives and the trade

293
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,079
crop that they use to act on them so if

294
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
you don't know what you're looking for

295
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,700
or what someone might be going after in

296
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,519
your system that's a problem

297
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,620
number three visibility across all

298
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,320
layers is super important even where Ops

299
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
management is on the CSP side of the

300
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
shared responsibility model

301
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,380
so you need to visualize as much as you

302
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,959
can in your environment you don't know

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,060
what you don't know to quote one of my

304
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,260
fantastic co-workers

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
so what is that shared responsibility

306
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,019
model

307
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,140
um this is one of the weirdest gray

308
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,600
areas in Cloud environments it is both

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,820
very well laid out and also very

310
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,000
confusing so an AWS shared security

311
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,660
model AWS claims responsibility for

312
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,640
protecting Hardware software networking

313
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,220
and facilities for the AWS cloud

314
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,660
services

315
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,940
Azure Microsoft Azure claims security

316
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,640
ownership of physical hosts networks and

317
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,279
data centers so both AWS and Azure state

318
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,420
that your routine Securities

319
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,459
responsibilities depend on which

320
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,980
services that you select

321
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,000
so when you look at the Shared

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,440
responsibility model the way that I

323
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
always like to explain it and look at it

324
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,140
is

325
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,380
as a customer your responsibility lies

326
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,260
for security in the cloud

327
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,600
as a cloud service provider whether it

328
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,779
be AWS Azure gcp anyone along those

329
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,839
lines your responsibilities lay in

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
security of the cloud so

331
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,760
putting things in the cloud does not

332
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,560
make them secure you need to learn how

333
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
to configure things correctly and things

334
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,680
like that but it is very important

335
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,420
especially when you're threat hunting

336
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,279
and you're looking for certain things in

337
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,019
the environment to know where your

338
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,700
responsibility lies in securing your

339
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,240
infrastructure

340
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,779
all right then I quickly want to talk

341
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,600
about multi-cloud considerations

342
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,560
um

343
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,660
that's been kind of a buzzword in the

344
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,820
industry for a while now and I know we

345
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,680
all love buzzwords

346
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,480
but it is definitely something we're

347
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,700
talking about so according to the

348
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,660
flexera 2022 state of the cloud report

349
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,060
89 of responding organizations reported

350
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,120
having a multi-cloud strategy and 80 are

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,740
taking a hybrid approach by combining

352
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,620
use of both public and private clouds so

353
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,920
you can see here 89 taking a multi-cloud

354
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,300
strategy I would say that's a pretty big

355
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,519
majority nine percent are sticking with

356
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,260
the single public cloud and two percent

357
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,579
with the single private cloud

358
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,899
so when you're talking about multi-cloud

359
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,700
environments it's really important to

360
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,500
understand what the differences are with

361
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,019
these so there's a lot of differences

362
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,700
between cloud service providers

363
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,860
oftentimes in compliance and

364
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,139
configuration transparency there are

365
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,820
some things that you can do with AWS

366
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,540
that you can't do with Azure vice versa

367
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,800
differences in remote data sources and

368
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,300
infrastructures your infrastructure is

369
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,800
going to look different across different

370
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
cloud service providers it's just the

371
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,480
nature of how things are set up

372
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,760
there will also be a lot of differences

373
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,240
in core security capabilities and apis

374
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,279
and finally cross environment analysis

375
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,120
and data correlation must be factored in

376
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,320
one of the biggest issues that I've run

377
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,300
into especially when creating you know a

378
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,500
security data Lake based on cloud

379
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,300
environments and things like that is

380
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,639
standardization of certain types of data

381
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,680
it's very different all across the board

382
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,420
all right so steps to take when you are

383
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,180
trying to Wrangle your multi-cloud

384
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,440
environments

385
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,420
first of all you want to normalize that

386
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,160
data and invent information that flows

387
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
between the multiple environments

388
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,579
including cloud service providers and

389
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,800
any on-prem environments you have try

390
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,779
and find a way to standardize that data

391
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,639
as much as possible

392
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,740
number uh you know you also want to

393
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,600
understand the events that happen across

394
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,160
environments sometimes they can look

395
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,660
different but they're actually the same

396
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,760
type of event

397
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
number two understanding systematic

398
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,260
threat modeling so taking attacker's

399
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,720
view of the application can really help

400
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,240
you develop hypotheses and threat Model

401
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,279
A little bit better so again it comes

402
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,380
back to the psychology of the attacker

403
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,060
what are they looking for what do you

404
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,319
have that would be valuable to them

405
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,120
number three education so you want to

406
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,220
understand what you have and how it fits

407
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,560
together with each other if you're

408
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,060
duplicating a lot of things from Cloud

409
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,199
to Cloud

410
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,899
that could be a potential issue down the

411
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,540
road you also step four want to

412
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,800
actualize you want to connect everything

413
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,079
into a narrative how does it all connect

414
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,880
together how does it work together and

415
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
how does it support each other if you're

416
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
using separate cloud service providers

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,620
and different Services across those

418
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,100
providers

419
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,279
yeah so as far as building a threat

420
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,440
hunting program I mean there's a lot of

421
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,360
different

422
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,180
I guess levels of threat hunting that

423
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,339
you can get into and it really depends

424
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,560
on the resources that you have and the

425
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,660
people that you have and the tools that

426
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,980
you have and there's a million different

427
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,740
things that can factor into it so as far

428
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
as I think that following a maturity

429
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,180
model like this would actually be really

430
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,720
beneficial because you are not trying to

431
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,480
have the most advanced threat hunting

432
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,399
program on day one I mean you can try

433
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,339
but it's gonna be really hard so I mean

434
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,260
a lot of there's unfortunately a lot of

435
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,660
places starting on this model that don't

436
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,699
have a threat hunting program whether

437
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,220
it's lack of resources or just

438
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,620
I don't know the reasons it makes me sad

439
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,079
but I get it everyone starts somewhere

440
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,339
so

441
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,560
there's also if you're going to start

442
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,180
out I think an initial

443
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,639
level of threat hunting is a good one so

444
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,800
relying on automated alerting tools and

445
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
correlating tools so if being able to

446
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,360
see how your data fits together things

447
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,060
like your WAFF your antivirus your IDs

448
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,220
your sim tools just kind of figuring out

449
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,079
what pieces each of those grabs and

450
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,699
putting them together there's not a lot

451
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,800
of hunting in that stage it's more of a

452
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,079
getting your visibility on point kind of

453
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,819
like talked about earlier where you

454
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,140
really need to understand what

455
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,179
everything looks like and see that Total

456
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,579
Landscape that you have

457
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,500
if you move up a little bit you've got

458
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,140
your minimal that sounds kind of

459
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,079
offensive I don't mean it that way but

460
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,660
um your it data is included for your

461
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,939
daily activity so you've got your all

462
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,319
your IIT data you've got all your

463
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,000
visibility set up you can see everything

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,340
you can start leveraging your threat

465
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,860
Intel feeds on any of the tools that

466
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,900
you're using and correlate a lot of the

467
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,720
data that is fed to your tools so

468
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
you're starting to kind of understand

469
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,100
the landscape okay you know these are

470
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,480
the threats that tie to the things that

471
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,179
I have going on right now

472
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,640
next up procedural

473
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,100
again a little bit more advanced your

474
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,780
analysts and researchers at this stage

475
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,660
are developing a lot of procedures at

476
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,559
this point

477
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,179
um threatening procedures things like

478
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,200
that

479
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,120
a lot of times though it is limited to

480
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,039
known or published ones so it's you know

481
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,200
procedures playbooks that other groups

482
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,900
are using and things like that

483
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,940
once you get up to the Innovative stage

484
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,620
that's where a lot of things get super

485
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,679
fun you can start obtaining data and

486
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,260
using data visibility and machine

487
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,980
learning to develop your own procedures

488
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,539
um

489
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,919
this stage does get a little bit hairy

490
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,660
because as you're starting to

491
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,160
standardize things from multiple Cloud

492
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,419
environments

493
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,280
it gets a little crazy there's a lot of

494
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,660
scale to address and deal with so

495
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,600
um it is a rough stage to be in but if

496
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,900
we want to look at the Utopia of threat

497
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,120
hunting that would be the leading

498
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,940
stage of the maturity model so at the

499
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,500
leading stage you would have the ability

500
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,840
to automate repetitive processes so

501
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,400
you're not wasting your time on those

502
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,860
tune existing processes to make them

503
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,600
more efficient

504
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,520
you'd be able to dedicate more time

505
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,140
because of that to build your own

506
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,700
processes

507
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,679
you would Define your metrics so kpis

508
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,660
and slas are super important once you

509
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,360
get to a mature threat hunting model

510
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,580
automated risk scoring again is

511
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,380
fantastic it takes some of the guesswork

512
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,700
out of things and if you can just

513
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,780
correlate data into a single risk score

514
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,340
that'll be super helpful and not having

515
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,140
people you know comb through some of the

516
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,820
lower level data

517
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,980
Horizon scanning

518
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,460
again super helpful regular hunts also

519
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,380
super helpful if you can get those done

520
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,780
pretty regularly start adding in new

521
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,160
procedures that you've come up with

522
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
processes things like that that'll be

523
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
really helpful for your threat hunting

524
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,299
program and finally High data visibility

525
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,740
whether it be a security data Lake where

526
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,539
you've got a bunch of stuff where you

527
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,220
can manipulate data to look at it or

528
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,679
anything across those lines data

529
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,780
visibility I think is one of the if you

530
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,760
take anything home from this take home

531
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,179
that data visibility is important

532
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,360
foreign

533
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,299
so if anyone has any questions I'm happy

534
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,900
to answer them

535
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:13,200
[Applause]
