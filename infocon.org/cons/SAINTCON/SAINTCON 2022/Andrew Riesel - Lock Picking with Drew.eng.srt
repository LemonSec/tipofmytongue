00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,159
hey welcome to lock picking 101

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,960
my name is Andrew Riesel I go by Drew

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,599
most of the time I'm the director of

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,300
security red team operations

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,920
this basically means my team and I break

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
into stuff get paid for it and don't get

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,039
arrested very often

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,800
I locked pick as a hobby a sport for

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,660
work and do it because I love to get

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,039
into things I'm not supposed to get into

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,439
I'll try to cover the basics of lock

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,660
picking today which includes what a pimp

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,780
Tumbler lock is and how to identify one

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,820
the reasons we can pick locks in the

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,960
first place

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,000
my opinion on a starting set of lock

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,020
picks

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,120
General types of picks and their usage

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,940
different ways to tension a lock and

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,620
then just some general tips and tricks

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,160
of learning

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
so pin Tumbler lock is probably the most

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,140
common lock you'll encounter in America

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,600
these are found on front doors padlocks

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,860
safes

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,680
lock boxes mailboxes Etc

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,380
if the key has a flat bottom and teeth

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,760
on the top

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,880
it's most likely a pin Tumbler lock

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,360
the pin Tumbler lock has several parts

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,060
that make up the lock the outer casing

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,159
which holds everything together green

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,380
and the image to the right the plug

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,240
which is the part that rotates and

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,299
unlocks the device in yellow

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,340
the key pins are the pins that interact

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,740
with the key and raise the driver pins

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,840
to the correct height which are red in

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,460
the image

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,680
the shear line is where the plug meets

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,659
the outer casing

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,820
the driver pins which prevent the plug

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,799
from turning until they're raised to the

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,140
shear line which are blue

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,780
and the pin chambers that hold are that

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,060
are the holes in the outer casing that

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,479
the plug and the holes the pins in place

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,220
if you look at the graphic in the lower

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,560
left it shows that when the proper key

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,540
is inserted into the lock

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,940
the key pins are raising the driver pins

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,160
to just above the shear line which

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,840
allows the plug to rotate freely

54
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,540
so in a perfect world driver pins would

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,060
be exactly the same diameter and the pin

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,239
Chambers would be perfectly in line

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,580
if this were the case then lock picking

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,860
would be almost impossible

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,140
luckily for us mass production allows

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,360
tolerances of materials which are

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
acceptable in manufacturing

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,040
in the diagram you can see exaggerated

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,879
example of accepted tolerances

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,099
when tension or rotational pressure is

65
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,040
applied to this lock binding will occur

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,920
at the largest diameter pin first

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,660
followed by the next largest down to the

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,640
smallest diameter

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,700
this is referred to as the locks binding

70
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,379
order

71
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,959
in the example at the right

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,300
pin two from the front of the lock is

73
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,040
the largest and will bind between the

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,620
plug and the outer casing first when

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,900
tension is applied to the lock

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,879
this will be followed by the first pin

77
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,819
the fifth pin the third pin and then the

78
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,500
fourth pin

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,659
if we raise the driver pin above the

80
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,060
shear line the plug will rotate a very

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,459
small amount and the next largest pin

82
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,379
will bind

83
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,599
to pick this lock we only need to repeat

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,099
this process for every pin

85
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,860
so a large number of picks isn't

86
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,920
necessary especially when you start out

87
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,659
in my opinion you don't need any more

88
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,640
than eight picks to start

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,560
I have a monstrous collection of

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,400
lockpicks well over 150. but to be

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,540
honest I use four or five 99 of the time

92
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,700
you can get upward of 50 low quality

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,640
picks for 20 bucks on Amazon but I'd

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,620
recommend against this

95
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,360
you should expect to spend between

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,340
thirty five and a hundred dollars on

97
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,200
only eight picks that are professional

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,120
grade quality

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,099
quality picks will be made as Superior

100
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,040
materials have far better finish and

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,620
hold a more consistent Kick profile than

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,780
the cheaper sets

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,298
lock picking is almost exclusively based

104
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,358
on feel of what a lock is doing inside

105
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,919
better picks are going to allow you to

106
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,479
feel what's going on inside the lock

107
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,340
much better

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,500
my recommendation for a starter set

109
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,620
would be for single pin picking a short

110
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,979
hook a deeper hook a curved reach hybrid

111
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,060
a diamond and a gem pick and for raking

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,699
rocking and scrubbing locks I'd

113
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,580
recommend a Bogota a snake rake in a

114
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,780
city rake

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,000
these picks get their name from profile

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,580
of the pick itself and or the curvature

117
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,000
of the pick

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,979
so it's really important to hold a pick

119
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,840
in a way that you'll receive feedback

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
from the lock

121
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,320
a few recommended holds are shown in the

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,460
slide

123
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,979
lock picking is a delicate process most

124
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,259
of the time to set a pin it can take

125
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,780
less than a millimeter of motion

126
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,660
if picks are held too tightly or used or

127
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,820
if you're using a fist it's much more

128
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,680
difficult to feel what's going on inside

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,220
that lock

130
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,320
tensioning a lock is accomplished by

131
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,060
inserting a tension wrench into the

132
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,600
keyway and adding torque to the plug

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,940
when picking use light tension to begin

134
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,000
with if you can feel if you can't feel

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,039
any binding pins then increase the

136
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
tension a little bit until you feel a

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,180
pin bind

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,919
if all the pins feel like they're

139
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,960
binding then release a little bit of the

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,919
pressure

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,139
until you can feel just one or two pins

142
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,400
bind

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,919
if the part of your finger pushing on

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,360
the tension wrench is turning white

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
you're probably applying too much

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,460
pressure

147
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,199
so I've mentioned a few different

148
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,180
techniques of lock picking such as

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,160
single pin picking raking rocking and

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,180
scrubbing

151
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,100
I'll try to clarify here what each of

152
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,759
these are in the upcoming slides

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,139
single pin picking is a process of

154
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,419
finding the binding pin raising it to

155
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,340
the proper level above the shear line

156
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,000
and moving on to the next binding pin

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
the process is repeated until all

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
binding pins are at the shear line and

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,080
the plug rotates

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,660
this method will open far more locks

161
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,020
than scrubbing raking or rocking

162
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,360
you'll have far better control of what's

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
Happening inside the lock using this

164
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
technique

165
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,479
scrubbing raking and rocking a lock are

166
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,160
considered the easiest methods of lock

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,860
picking

168
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,300
it's just a matter of putting tension on

169
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,580
the plug using a specially designed pick

170
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,800
to manipulate as many pins as possible

171
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,660
at once

172
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,580
these techniques are not very successful

173
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,039
in high security or well manufactured

174
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,900
locks

175
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
in the example scrubbing is done by

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,060
applying tension to the plug and

177
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,160
scrubbing the pick in and out up and

178
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,400
down of the lock until pin set start to

179
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
set

180
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll clarify here what each of these are

181
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,020
in upcoming slides

182
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,319
hooks which include deep hooks hybrid

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,860
reach short Hooks and gen picks are

184
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,099
primarily used for single pin picking

185
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,259
hooks are used by applying tension to

186
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,660
the plug inserting the pick into the

187
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,620
lock and feeling for that binding pin

188
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,240
The Binding pin will have more

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,580
resistance than the other pins and feels

190
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,819
more like a metal on metal rubbing

191
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,460
once The Binding pin is found the key

192
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,500
pin is raised until the driver pin is

193
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
set immediately above the shear line

194
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,960
once this is accomplished the next

195
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,639
binding pin will be found and the

196
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,620
process repeats for as many pins as

197
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,319
there are in the lock

198
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
so what do the pins feel like at each

199
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,979
stage

200
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,460
a non-binding pin that is not set will

201
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,800
feel a little bit springy they'll be

202
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,020
obvious downward Force pushing on that

203
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,699
PIN

204
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,280
a binding pin will feel like metal on

205
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,900
metal friction and have a little bit

206
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,759
more resistance

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
a pin that is already set will have no

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,699
added downward Force it won't feel

209
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,979
springy at all you'll only feel the

210
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,599
weight of the key pin and gravity

211
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,440
the half diamond pick named due to the

212
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,479
appearance of the head of the pick can

213
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,000
be used to single pick or can be used to

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,159
rake or scrub a lock

215
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,080
in this example we're seeing the half

216
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Diamond being used as a single pin pick

217
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,180
the half diamond is inserted into the

218
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,459
lock and each pin is touched to find The

219
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,839
Binding pin

220
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,540
once located the pin is raised until the

221
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,519
driver pin is just above the shear line

222
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,220
and again at that point the next binding

223
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,720
pin is located and raised

224
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,360
the Bogota pick is primarily used to

225
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,740
rake a lock

226
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,779
raking a lock is all about moving

227
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,300
multiple pins at once and applying

228
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,279
tension to the plug

229
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,740
a rake type pick is inserted into the

230
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,080
lock and moved in and out up and down in

231
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,740
the keyway until the lock opens

232
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,140
if the lock doesn't open in a minute or

233
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,660
two release all the tension on the plug

234
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,120
and try again

235
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,160
other common picks that can be used for

236
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,200
raking are the snake rake in the city

237
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,680
rake

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
rocking a lock is done by inserting the

239
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,740
pick a city raking this example all the

240
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,600
way into the lock and moving the pick up

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,940
and down rocking it on an imaginary

242
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,019
fulcrum point forward and backward

243
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,240
movement is also applied to the pick in

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,040
order to hit the higher and low sections

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,519
of the pick

246
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,080
so setting the driver pin exactly in the

247
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
right location above the shear line is

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
what makes lock picking challenging

249
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
if you raise the keep in too high you'll

250
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,580
end up over setting the PIN

251
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,620
over setting is when the key pin is

252
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,019
pushed up past the share line and gets

253
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,480
stuck up there due to the tension

254
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,580
if this occurs

255
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,800
the plug will not rotate even if you

256
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,220
have all the other pins set

257
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,779
it's difficult to recover from over

258
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,820
setting and sometimes easier just to

259
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,800
start over again

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,779
a recovery method that's worked for me

261
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,360
is to very slowly release tension on the

262
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,080
lock until you hear or feel the over pin

263
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,640
overset pin drop

264
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,100
you might drop more than one pin that

265
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,260
was over set but you might get lucky and

266
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,100
only drop that one

267
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,220
so tensioning there are two primary

268
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
methods to tensional lock from the

269
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,380
bottom and from the top of the keyway

270
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,779
with bottom of keyway tensioning the

271
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,339
tensioner is placed at the bottom of the

272
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,779
keyway

273
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,060
bottom of tensioning tools are normally

274
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,700
a piece of flat metal bent into an L

275
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,959
shape

276
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,000
they can have twists in the body to

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
provide additional Comfort while picking

278
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
however these twists can dampen feedback

279
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,560
on the lock

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,660
with top of keyway the tensioner is

281
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,820
placed at the top of the keyway

282
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
commercial type of keyway tensioners

283
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,920
have an s-shape and little teeth at the

284
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,880
end

285
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,800
these can have a longer side that helps

286
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,420
you get into keyways that sit much

287
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,760
deeper in the housing and a short side

288
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,740
for normal keyways that are flush with

289
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,300
the housing

290
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,640
a lot of Pickers add shrink wrap to the

291
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,459
handles of top of keyway tensioners for

292
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,540
comfort

293
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,300
two of mine in the lower left show this

294
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,579
these additions again are more

295
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,680
comfortable but they can dampen feedback

296
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,279
from the lock

297
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,560
so bottom of keyway tensioning is where

298
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,940
most people start out since it's

299
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,620
incredibly stable

300
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,660
the end of the L shape that's inserted

301
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,940
into the keyway can be very long since

302
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,380
it doesn't interfere with any of the

303
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,300
pins above it

304
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,579
the tensioner itself can also provide a

305
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,680
nice bottom platform that you can slide

306
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,380
on slide picks on

307
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,600
this platform is useful in raking and

308
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,399
scrubbing locks

309
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,620
the biggest disadvantage of using bottom

310
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,540
of keyway tensioning tools is it takes

311
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,000
up a lot of space in the keyway which

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
reduces the space a picker has to work

313
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,660
with

314
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,779
so in this slide on the

315
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,000
right hand side

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
the green portion indicates where the

317
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,740
pins sit and the purple portion

318
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,139
indicates the room a picker has to work

319
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,000
with when using bottom of keyway

320
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,760
top of keyway tensioning is what most

321
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,519
Pickers progress to over time

322
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,100
as a picker starts to single pin pick

323
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,740
more and more a larger work area is

324
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,940
desired

325
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,940
top of keyway provides a much larger

326
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,220
area for pigs to move

327
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,620
there are two examples of topic keyway

328
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,019
tensioners in this Slide the one on the

329
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,459
left hand side shows a commercial

330
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,100
tensioner and the one on the right shows

331
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,839
a custom made tensioner

332
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll cover how the custom tensioners are

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,240
made in later slides

334
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,740
a disadvantage of top of keyway

335
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,720
tensioning is the amount of material

336
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,480
that is inserted into the keyway is far

337
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,700
less than that a bottom of key wave

338
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,860
this length is restricted by the first

339
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,720
pin in a lock

340
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
this can cause the tensioner to slip out

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,720
of the keyway much much easier

342
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,399
so on the left side with the green

343
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,040
that's the commercial top of keyway

344
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,860
tensioner the green portion is going to

345
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,660
be where your PIN sit and the purple

346
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,839
portion is going to be how much room you

347
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,060
actually have to work with your pick

348
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,339
on the right hand side is the custom

349
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,600
tensioner

350
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,760
the green portion is going to be where

351
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,639
the tensioner actually sits the red is

352
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,500
where the pins sit and then that large

353
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,620
purple area is going to be how much room

354
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,360
you actually have to work with your

355
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,779
tools

356
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,959
so when I started out picking I hadn't I

357
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,700
had trouble determining what locks to

358
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,339
attempt next I'd finish a Master Lock

359
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,100
and just go buy another Master Lock

360
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,440
at the time I didn't realize that there

361
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,660
were different difficulties and locks

362
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,519
based on manufacturers and security

363
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,260
levels

364
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,360
there's a really useful Reddit group

365
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,279
that's put together a belt system for

366
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,980
lock Pickers this is like the belt

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,779
system that's used in certain martial

368
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,860
arts

369
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,079
in order to progress to the next level

370
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,260
belt color a certain criteria must be

371
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,639
met first

372
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,980
this is normally advancing to a more

373
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,100
secure or better manufactured lock

374
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,899
shown in the slide are the first three

375
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,240
belts that can be obtained and the locks

376
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,699
that qualify for those rankings

377
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,339
additional information on this can be

378
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,560
found at the r lock picking on Reddit

379
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,579
so bottom of key tensioners are

380
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,800
incredibly easy to make and in most time

381
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,860
in most cases absolutely free the main

382
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,620
material for these can be found inside

383
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,959
old windshield wiper blades

384
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,699
when people change out the windshield

385
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,100
wiper blades at auto parts stores they

386
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,440
throw away the old ones so when it rains

387
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,240
or snows head out to one of these stores

388
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,639
and grab as many old windshield wiper

389
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,139
blades as you want

390
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,480
there's a long flat piece of Steel

391
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,820
inside the blade that's the perfect size

392
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,100
for bottom of key tensioners

393
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,139
additionally there are different widths

394
00:15:58,139 --> 00:15:59,880
of this piece of metal inside certain

395
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,959
blades

396
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,760
this will allow you to build a tensioner

397
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,459
that fits inside of smaller keyways and

398
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,160
smaller locks much easier

399
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,980
to build one of these go out and get an

400
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,740
old windshield wiper blade pull out that

401
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,300
thin piece of metal that will be used

402
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,160
for your tensioning tool

403
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,440
cut it to the desired size and put a 90

404
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,180
degree Bend in the end

405
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,160
you can then put a Twist in the body if

406
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,000
you like for comfort

407
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,300
so cut top of keyway tensioners are also

408
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,579
fairly easy to make

409
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,560
the difference is the material will need

410
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,540
to be purchased

411
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,820
I make my top of keyway tensioners out

412
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,320
of Music wire that I get off of

413
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,940
amazon.com

414
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,680
I've included the link at the end of

415
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,500
this presentation if you're interested

416
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,839
once you have the music wire bend the

417
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,839
tip 90 degrees before you cut it since

418
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,880
the tip of the top of keyway is much

419
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,500
shorter than out of bottom of keyway

420
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,880
it's easier to bend first and then cut

421
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,220
you want it long enough to tension the

422
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,619
lock but not so long that it touches the

423
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,900
first pin inside the lock

424
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,179
cut the handle to the desired size after

425
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,000
that and file the tip until it fits

426
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,939
snugly into the top of the keyway

427
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,919
the tighter the fit the more control

428
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,559
you'll have over the plug

429
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,419
come find me in the lock picking Village

430
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,819
if I'm not there if you'd like to try

431
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,040
one of these top of keyway tensioners

432
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,220
out

433
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,039
so lock pits are mass produced and have

434
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
little bits of metal still attached to

435
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,039
them from the stamping process

436
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,539
finish on these picks are not always the

437
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,140
best and can feel rough inside of a lock

438
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,600
if you polish a pick you'll be able to

439
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,460
feel what's happening inside of a lock

440
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,900
much better

441
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,200
to do this grab some sandpaper I usually

442
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,419
start with 500 grit and work my way up

443
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,220
to a thousand Grit

444
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,100
sand the sides the top the bottom of the

445
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,400
pick until it is smooth to the touch

446
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,740
make sure you don't change the profile

447
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,140
of the pick tip

448
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,600
I'll then use a flitz metal polish after

449
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,640
this process to put a mirror finish on

450
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
the tool

451
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,059
remember you're only doing this to

452
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,919
remove leftover material from the

453
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,260
manufacturing process and to give the

454
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,840
pick a nicer feel you're not really

455
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,700
wanting to remove the metal of the pick

456
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,179
itself

457
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,240
so practice locks are great to see

458
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,340
what's going on inside of a lock

459
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,799
this will help you identify how far the

460
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,840
distance between pins are

461
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,820
and what it looks like when the key pin

462
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,919
is raised as well as when the driver pin

463
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,660
is set

464
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,299
remember lock picking is based on feel

465
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,720
not sight so if you decide to get one of

466
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,059
these locks be careful that you don't

467
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,059
become dependent on picking visually

468
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,980
there are two types of practice locks

469
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,980
that I'm familiar with the clear acrylic

470
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,600
locks that allow you to see through the

471
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,919
entire body

472
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,020
and the Cutaway type that has a window

473
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,360
cut out of a real lock

474
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,580
because cutaway locks are made from real

475
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,460
locks they can be useful in learning the

476
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,980
feel of how log picking works

477
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,320
the acrylic locks tend to feel much

478
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,559
different than a real lock in my opinion

479
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,900
another option is to create a practice

480
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,140
lock on your own

481
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,179
excuse me by gutting the lock and

482
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,039
re-pinning it with just a few pins at a

483
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,640
time this is called Progressive pinning

484
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,980
by doing this you'll get the feel of

485
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,020
where each pin is and what it's like

486
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,480
when a pin is set to the correct height

487
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,720
an additional benefit to this method is

488
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,240
that it gives you a real in-depth

489
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,120
knowledge of how locks work and how to

490
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
pin them

491
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,299
so over time locks get all kinds of

492
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,220
garbage in the keyway this can gum up

493
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,200
the pins and the plugs making it more

494
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,820
difficult to feel what's going on in

495
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,400
there whenever I pick a lock I hit it

496
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,559
with something called Houdini lock Lube

497
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,880
if I have it

498
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,860
it cleans out the junk in a lock and

499
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,419
lubricates the moving Parts without

500
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,760
gumming up the inside like other Loops

501
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
can

502
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,539
another option is to use dry graphite

503
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,299
spray it doesn't clean out the lock but

504
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,880
it does provide a good lubricant

505
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,740
try to avoid stuff like three in one

506
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,220
oils and WD-40 to lube a lock

507
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,679
they'll do a job in a pinch but over

508
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,960
time tend to gum up the insides and make

509
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,280
everything feel pretty sticky

510
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,080
so you can get locks from all over the

511
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,640
place you can buy them at hardware

512
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,679
stores buy special ones off the internet

513
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
or even trade locks unlock picking

514
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,220
forums

515
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,620
if you live near a truck stop people cut

516
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,299
locks off their trailers all the time

517
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,000
and they just leave it on the ground

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
these things are perfectly pickable you

519
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,020
don't need the shackle portion to be

520
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,120
intact to practice with it

521
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,760
a place I use frequently is the Habitat

522
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
for Humanity

523
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
they can't sell locks they don't have

524
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,100
keys so they take the locks off and sell

525
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,960
them for scrap metal

526
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,880
if you offer to buy them at scrap metal

527
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,700
prices or a little above they tend to go

528
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,080
for that sale

529
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
can normally get a five gallon bucket

530
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,799
full of locks for about 20 bucks

531
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
these are some of the sites I borrowed

532
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
images from and gifts for this

533
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,679
presentation I would highly recommend

534
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,260
reading the book or PDF lock picking

535
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,220
detailed Overkill by m Gibson it's

536
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,039
downloadable all over the place from a

537
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,020
lot of areas for free

538
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,299
a few channels I watch regularly on

539
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,760
YouTube are the lock picking lawyer The

540
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,580
Helpful lock picker in Bosnian build

541
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,340
if I get stuck on a specific lock most

542
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,659
likely one of these guys will have

543
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,900
suggestions on how to defeat it

544
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,179
the link for the music wire that I use

545
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,580
for my top of keyway tensioner is at the

546
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,080
bottom right

547
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
the QR code on the right will link

548
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,220
directly to the page I use

549
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,980
just ignore the C2 agent install and

550
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,600
select yes when prompted
