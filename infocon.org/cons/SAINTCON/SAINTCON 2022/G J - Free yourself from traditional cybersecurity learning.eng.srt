00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
welcome to Free Yourself from

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,279
traditional cyber security learning

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:06,480
I wanted to learn cyber security

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,860
learning cyber security today and I'm

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,559
going to talk about my journey my

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,199
journey isn't perfect I had plenty of

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,119
challenges along the way

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,720
and I'm not done with my journey yet I'm

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,119
still learning

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,199
um

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,840
and I hope that this talk will get you

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
started on your own journey in cyber

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,180
security learning

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,960
um

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,120
with that being said I'm going to talk

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,280
about my progress and my journey so far

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
so

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,840
from the beginning as a young kid I've

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,420
always been around Tech and puzzles

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,460
um we've done we do a lot of tech and

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,340
puzzles as a family a lot

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,500
um one of the earliest experiences of

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
the pot of puzzles

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,699
what is when my father came home from

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,699
Saint Khan 2013 with these puzzle Badges

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,280
and I thought it was really cool to

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
assemble them and see what they and try

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,240
and figure out what they meant

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,060
and I want to know how things work in a

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,820
Natural Curiosity to lead the discovery

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,500
of things

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,000
um so after many weeks of begging my

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,299
father to let me come to Saint Khan

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,880
he let me come so I could see what it

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,619
was really like

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,220
um

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,759
so I started competing in 2019

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,460
and the hackers Challenge and it was a

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,420
lot of fun I did not know as much as I

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,680
wanted to know and it was really hard

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,540
like I knew nothing

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,920
I didn't know how to do any of the

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
challenges

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,720
so being in this world that I had no

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,240
idea how to operate and function

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,920
was very interesting after I could not

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,020
compete in the 2020 because of covid and

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,379
uh but I practiced a couple of things

49
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,379
but I had to learn all that and do it

50
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,020
and prepare it all by myself

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,540
so after covid I went back and in 2021 I

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,900
competed in the hackers challenge again

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
I did

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,440
a significantly better than the last

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,780
year and I remained at top 20 the entire

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,660
year up until the trivia and I did not

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,180
know half as much of the trivia as

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,640
everybody else so I ended up around the

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
top 100 and I really wanted to do better

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,700
so I've been really looking forward for

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
this year because I've been preparing

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,160
and I hope to do really well

63
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,280
so I had a big problem in my cyber

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,319
security learning

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,860
and it is I didn't have any budget I

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
don't have a job

67
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,900
and so I don't have a job to give me

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,739
opportunities to learn these things

69
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,800
um

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,720
I had to get creative with the resources

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,180
available to me in order to learn the

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,459
things that I wanted to learn

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,540
um

74
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,140
I reached out for help and here are a

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,480
couple things that I found my first

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,680
program is called try Hackney it is an

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
online or digital cyber security

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,599
learning platform and it has lots of

79
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,060
options to pick from from digital

80
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,640
forensics or computer forensics it

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,099
includes the discovery recovery and

82
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,060
investigation of Digital Data

83
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,920
malware reverse engineering which is

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,140
taking malware and seeing how it really

85
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,159
works

86
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,459
and network traffic analysis and is

87
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,560
capturing and looking at pieces in for

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,080
of information called packets sent over

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,799
a computer network

90
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,799
um

91
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,019
try hack me has actually hackable

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,139
machines so you can create an on-demand

93
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,720
Cloud hacking

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
room

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,940
on by and you could learn hacking by

96
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,940
actually hacking and if you've ever

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,520
heard the saying learn by doing it is

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,199
100 True for cyber security

99
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,759
I use this to learn by doing this in a

100
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,220
controlled and safe environment so if

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,940
something went wrong I could fix it and

102
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,160
start back up and figure out what I did

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
wrong

104
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,620
um rooms are separated like track track

105
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,320
me separates their services into these

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,680
things called Rooms each room has like

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,759
specific area that it would cover and it

108
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,259
teaches you

109
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,180
step by step how to do something so you

110
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,220
can go through the room and it will

111
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,680
teach you how to do it

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,400
and so you can when you go back

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,740
try it again and you will know exactly

114
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,380
how to do it

115
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,539
you can do this you can do a room as

116
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,120
many times as you wish

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,780
and you can pick from a very big variety

118
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,400
of rims

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,259
when you are going through rooms you

120
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,380
answer questions as you go through

121
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,660
to make sure that you're learning and

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,120
you're comprehending what you have just

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
read and done

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,860
um and it also ensures that you're doing

125
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,560
the whole task and not skimping out on

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,500
some parts when it gets hard

127
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,560
um so what if you what do you do when

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,180
you get stuck

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,400
or you get an error that you that Google

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
doesn't know the answer to well the

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
answer is community uh you reach out I

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,400
reached out to people on Discord they

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
have a Discord server that is completely

134
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,199
free to join and they have specific

135
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,100
chats to help you with these rooms and

136
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,660
there are a bunch of people willing to

137
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,620
help you

138
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,020
if you need a little nudge in the right

139
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,419
direction there's a special hint channel

140
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,060
that allows they will just give you a

141
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,800
tiny hint so then you can get on your

142
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,380
way and figure it out yourself

143
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,620
um mostly everyone is super nice and

144
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,539
totally willing to walk you work you

145
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,979
through the issues that you come across

146
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,199
in order to do this you need a computer

147
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,259
right

148
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,220
one that has all the tools that you need

149
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,960
they have virtual machines ready and

150
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,699
waiting for you

151
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,120
um you can a virtual a cloud virtual

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,220
machine is a digital version of a

153
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,139
physical computer

154
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:04,979
um

155
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,400
a virtual machine is software can run

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
programs or operating systems and can

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,819
connect to networks they can also run

158
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,400
updated updated software for an extra

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
challenge you can also run a specific

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,620
version or software to practice or learn

161
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,180
a particular exploit

162
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,400
once you hit start machine

163
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
you will it will start load up and you

164
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,840
will have a machine to use to hack to

165
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,460
your heart's content

166
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,099
until you're one hour's up because

167
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,259
remember

168
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,479
I don't have any money so I wasn't able

169
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,720
to pay for the premium subscription that

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,580
allowed you to have it for more than an

171
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,960
hour

172
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,479
um so

173
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,419
this meant that I had a the virtual

174
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,639
machine would shut down immediately on

175
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,680
the dot for one hour

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
and I noticed a workaround after some

177
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,220
digging through and it is you can use

178
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,400
your own hacking computer

179
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,199
um so

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,620
and I wanted to do this because I wasn't

181
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,060
super fast at doing these things

182
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,120
initially I had to sit there and read it

183
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,940
multiple times try it over and over and

184
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,020
over again until I finally got it right

185
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,699
um

186
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,360
so this allows me to do it without that

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,820
limitation of one hour so I needed my

188
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,899
own computer

189
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,500
so I convinced my father to let me have

190
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,839
an old computer to work with

191
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,180
but the issue is

192
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,940
it had a really bad hard drive

193
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,640
it would not boot up at all

194
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
it couldn't boot up

195
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,920
and it I tried re-imaging it like

196
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,899
starting from the very beginning getting

197
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,519
rid of Windows and then putting it back

198
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,459
on and it just did not work the hard

199
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,839
drive was completely out of the computer

200
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,580
so I had to come up with yet again

201
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,339
another creative solution

202
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,380
um

203
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,420
so that allowed me to use the computer

204
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,760
without touching the hard drive at all

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,000
so after lots of research I found

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,040
Kali live it is a bootable USB drive

207
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,600
that bypasses the hard drive completely

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,760
I was able to set up I was able to set

209
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,160
up with everything that I needed

210
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,860
using Cali live you might be wondering

211
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,440
what is calling it is a special

212
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,899
operating system built specifically for

213
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,060
testing of products

214
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,959
security it is also called penetration

215
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,779
testing or pen testing it can also be

216
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,019
referred to as red teaming I just

217
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,440
downloaded in the image of Kali live and

218
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,240
all the tools I needed and installed it

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,459
to a USB drive

220
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,640
and the Cali features are in some of the

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,800
Cali features that are super important

222
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,540
security tools are

223
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,420
and they're built in are

224
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,320
um nmap which is a network mapping tool

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
for scanning networks and identifying

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,779
open ports and addresses

227
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,540
um Metasploit which is a framework with

228
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,720
tons of different built-in capabilities

229
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,060
for exploits

230
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,660
um

231
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,540
hashcad which is used for cracking and

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,019
decoding hashes or password recovery

233
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,600
you can use dictionaries with this or

234
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,560
word list that you create

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,440
um

236
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,019
burp Suite which is for web application

237
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,019
testing

238
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,820
Hydra which is a Brute Force password

239
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,000
cracker and Wireshark for Network

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,459
traffic analysis and packet capture

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,899
um so for I used etcher to initially

242
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,140
give the cop put the Cali life on the

243
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,500
USB on the one on the left but it didn't

244
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,120
work the intended way

245
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,519
it was meant to

246
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,420
um it did not save a thing I did and

247
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,060
later I realized that I needed to

248
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,640
partition the drive and it's basically

249
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,519
telling a computer what part of the U

250
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,760
what part of storage is for what

251
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,480
um

252
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,000
so I used a different program called

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Rufus that allowed me to do that at the

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,279
same time

255
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,700
and eventually I had the one on the left

256
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
and it broke

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,660
and so I needed to make a new one so I

258
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,720
made the one on the right which had uh

259
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,820
like a hundred times more space for me

260
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,600
to do all the things that I have learned

261
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,480
um after I felt pretty good about myself

262
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,540
and like I know all this stuff I decided

263
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,680
to compete and the BYU CTF and a CTF is

264
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,500
I captured the flag competition where

265
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,940
you compete to solve the solve problems

266
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,700
and get flags to turn them in for points

267
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,220
kind of like it is the hack like the

268
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,860
hackers challenge here at St con

269
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,200
um I found about I found out about it in

270
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,140
the sync on Discord server

271
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,860
um I tried it and it was very fun

272
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,360
but I really sucked like I did not know

273
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,860
anything

274
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,579
um

275
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,380
I got Rick Rolled way too many times

276
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,779
during that too it was really not great

277
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,000
um so there's one uh problem in

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,220
particular I want to point out

279
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,980
um because I struggled so much with this

280
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,240
one

281
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
um I was given this picture and the

282
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,920
problem reading somehow somewhere

283
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,680
something in this picture has a flag but

284
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,320
my friend blue Orca won't tell me where

285
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,019
it is can you help me

286
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,800
and so I got to work and I found the

287
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,019
building that is right next to it and

288
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,040
has that uh has the sign out on the

289
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,000
right

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,160
and I thought that was very important

291
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,500
given that it's covered in a blue mark

292
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,800
from like your iPhone you mark it over

293
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,660
so then they you couldn't read the

294
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,519
address and know exactly what you were

295
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,959
doing

296
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,540
um so I Googled it I didn't find the key

297
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,060
but I was so sure that it was that

298
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,040
because it was kind of shaped like I

299
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,380
thought it was shaped like an orca so of

300
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,019
course it had to be that

301
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,480
um but I neglected to look at the giant

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,480
blue water tower literally in the

303
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,260
picture

304
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,019
and if I had just Googled the name of

305
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,680
that water tower I would have gotten it

306
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,639
um so sometimes it is just

307
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,980
in plain sight

308
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,839
um next I want to talk about one last

309
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,899
type of cyber security and personally my

310
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,060
favorite to play with

311
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,940
the he The Human Side of security

312
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,040
it is also something that I really

313
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,300
wanted to learn

314
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,639
for those of you that may know who my

315
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
father is he really likes his social

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,779
engineering

317
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:19,620
um

318
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,139
he

319
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,899
and he has a big library of social

320
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,360
engineering books and I decided to read

321
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,639
some so I could learn how to do what he

322
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,079
does

323
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,100
um

324
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,920
my favorite was by far never split the

325
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,260
difference by Chris Voss

326
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,220
um

327
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,740
after reading all these during school

328
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,620
one day I decided to apply what I just

329
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,720
learned

330
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
so I try I was thinking why don't I do

331
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,579
something weird and see if I can get

332
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,300
people to do it so I went into class and

333
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,139
got like two students other students to

334
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,420
take off their right shoe and leave it

335
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
in front of the door

336
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,500
and we were trying to get

337
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
some get the people to take off their

338
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
right shoe and leave it at the door and

339
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,880
walk in with only their left shoe not

340
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,899
their left only their right

341
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,339
um

342
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,139
it's random yeah is it weird yes but did

343
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,899
it work most definitely within five

344
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,260
minutes we had over 10 shoes sitting in

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,540
front of the door

346
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,000
um if I didn't even have to put out a

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,959
sign or say any words at all and they

348
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,519
just did it

349
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,100
um there was also an outcome that I

350
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,399
didn't expect that came out I had

351
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,860
created a couple of students a group of

352
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,139
students that would try random stuff

353
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,660
every class period and I'm still to this

354
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,320
day very much paying for what I did very

355
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,420
at the very beginning

356
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,800
um

357
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
I have a couple of lessons that I've

358
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,420
learned over my journey the first is if

359
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,220
you put your mind to it you can do

360
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,600
anything

361
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,120
anyone can learn to do this it takes

362
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,600
work and it takes practice it takes

363
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,480
persistence and dedication without these

364
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,680
things

365
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,380
you can't do it but if you have all

366
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,079
these things anybody can learn this no

367
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,420
matter who you are

368
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,060
um there are a few number two there are

369
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,740
free resources

370
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,600
I didn't have a budget

371
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,940
and if you don't have a budget there are

372
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,279
still opportunities for you

373
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,279
I've found a lot of free resources for

374
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,639
this and it made my learning process a

375
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,899
whole lot better

376
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,120
you can try some of the resources that

377
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,399
I've mentioned or you can go and find

378
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,180
some for yourself

379
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,660
and there are tons out there so if you

380
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,459
can't find some keep on going

381
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,320
persistence

382
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,040
dedication number three don't be afraid

383
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,480
to reach out

384
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,299
Saint Khan is an amazing Community I

385
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,000
have been helped by so many people in

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,020
the community

387
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,260
and they've contributed so much of their

388
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,900
time and expertise to me and I'm very

389
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,240
thankful for that they've made me who I

390
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
am today

391
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
um

392
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,240
we have a very strong Community to help

393
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,240
lift everybody up and every everybody is

394
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,540
a newbie at some point and everybody

395
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,539
started at that low point so

396
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,660
everybody can help bring the new people

397
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,360
and give them the the knowledge that

398
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,220
they need

399
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,799
um and it is okay to not know something

400
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,860
and this is okay to ask ask these

401
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,620
questions even though they may be basic

402
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
or simple or like at the very beginning

403
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,960
like you don't want to waste anybody's

404
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,080
time it's okay you can ask those

405
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,460
questions because that's how you start

406
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,440
um number four there are some things

407
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,679
easier to pick up than others

408
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,080
some things will be really hard to learn

409
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,380
and some will be easy

410
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,660
I didn't know which ones were easy which

411
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,600
ones were hard until I tried them and

412
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,220
that's okay

413
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,940
some things will be a big challenge

414
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,320
until you learn the fundamentals

415
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,299
sometimes at number five sometimes it's

416
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,360
super simple even where it doesn't seem

417
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
like it it's always a good idea to look

418
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,500
at the most basic situation and look for

419
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,100
the simple answer the basic solution

420
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,799
and sometimes I got stuck looking for

421
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,960
something way more complicated when it

422
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,280
was really simple

423
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,980
so I recommend that you start from the

424
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,600
very beginning

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,640
and work your way up

426
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,100
all right thank you everybody for coming

427
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,740
to my talk I will open it up to some

428
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,160
questions

429
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:15,759
[Applause]

430
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,440
see all right

431
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,720
um it let's see

432
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,380
um

433
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,520
a lot of it is uh a lot of it is being

434
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,360
able to get out of I got out a lot of a

435
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,240
lot of school work and negotiated like

436
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,179
if I do this pay give you this paper for

437
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,980
another class instead can I still get

438
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,320
points for this it was very great I

439
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,700
didn't have to do half as much work

440
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,059
um

441
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,059
a lot of also getting into places that

442
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,820
like I shouldn't you know and then being

443
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,380
able to uh I know a lot of I like to use

444
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,280
fusion 360. and so I negotiate like got

445
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,039
my got a teacher to put me on the

446
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,080
education license for that even though I

447
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,419
am not enrolled in the class

448
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,980
so it's pretty fun
