1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,920
all right we are going to show you how

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,620
to put together probably the coolest

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,920
mini badge at syncon 2022 this is the

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,500
Darth Vader mini badge it's one of the

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,500
ones that I've created but it's not for

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
General consumption by the attendees

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,840
this is actually used by me to hand out

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,939
to folks that have made some significant

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,619
contributions to the conference and it's

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,199
kind of my individual thank you gift for

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,420
them and so that's how we're treating

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,399
this but

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
if you're one of those lucky people to

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,820
get one of these this instruction video

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
is how to put it together without

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,420
breaking it or causing problems and

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,820
making it easy as possible for you so

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,860
let's get right to it I'm going to bring

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,420
this down we'll get this this camera

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,640
close and let's look what's inside the

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,379
bag here

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,239
inside the bag you should have several

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,879
components and

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,620
Vader it's kind of hard to get out of

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,199
the bag sometimes

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,780
but here we go so inside this bag you

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,780
should have the Darth Vader PCB you

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,180
should have four of these two position

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,159
pin headers

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,860
and then you should have a green

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,180
resistor

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,720
a green LED oops it kind of bounces all

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,280
over the place so green resistor green

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,360
LED

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,420
two red resistors and two red LEDs so

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,220
that's where these are

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,020
here and then there's going to be this

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,080
resistor that's marked blue

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
so the blue resistor is for the LED

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,900
filament and so we'll put that on when

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,579
we do that later so that can go up there

42
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,880
and sit by him and then the red LEDs and

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,700
the green LED actually fit on this front

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,880
face of the Darth Vader and so I'm going

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,820
to show you where it's not marked and so

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,079
you've got to kind of pay some close

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,600
attention to to where I'm going to show

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,320
you here so on his front face plate

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,479
there is

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,520
a small pad

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,460
of for an LED right here

52
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,040
and so it actually goes top to bottom

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
that's the orientation and this one

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,239
right next to it also goes top to bottom

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,940
the one on the right is intended to be

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,980
the green LED

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,860
the one on the left will be a red LED

58
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,660
and then down here

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,200
there's going to be a red

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,459
LED on these two pads right here okay

61
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,080
the other pads so this one that's going

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
to be horizontal this one that's

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
horizontal and this one that's vertical

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,200
are the resistors for the individual

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,500
LEDs and so let's go ahead and get

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
started I'm going to add a little dab of

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,840
solder to one side of each of the LED

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,900
positions to make it easier to put those

69
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,459
LEDs on here in just a minute so I'm

70
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,319
going to get a hot iron

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,660
clean tip

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,940
and I'm just going to heat up this

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,200
topmost pad and put just a tiny

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,120
dab of solder on it

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,019
the next top pad tiny dab of solder and

76
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,540
then this next top pad right here is a

77
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,400
tiny dab of solder

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,819
and so those right there will be for

79
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,040
setting those LEDs if you want to see

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,599
that just a little bit I put put it on

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,860
the two top pieces so this pad this pad

82
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,599
and this one all three for the LED

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,220
positions

84
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,780
and then what we're going to do is we're

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,599
going to put the red LEDs on First and

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,159
so I'm going to grab the red LEDs and

87
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,019
pull them out of this little case you

88
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,300
can do that by being a little or put a

89
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,040
little finesse into the

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,319
LED case you got to be careful not to

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,959
make these snap and bounce all over the

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:40,860
place

93
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,739
and so it's a little bit of a process

94
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,220
but you can get those out

95
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,000
now as you can see these LEDs are super

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,959
super tiny but on the back of them shows

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,480
the orientation that we need to know

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,459
about okay let's see if this will focus

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,739
in with the light

100
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,360
it's kind of hard I hope the 4K thing

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,379
works this right here is the orientation

102
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,420
you'll see the little nub on the bottom

103
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,659
end toward the bottom of the tweezers

104
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,580
that signifies the negative side of that

105
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,940
led and the negative sides for these

106
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,220
LEDs on this entire badge Point down

107
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,740
toward his feet okay and so that's also

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,660
a negative side and so those two are

109
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,180
oriented correctly so what I'm going to

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,979
do is I'm going to turn this to the side

111
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,780
to make this a little bit easier to

112
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,740
handle

113
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,720
and I'm going to take

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,820
one of these LEDs

115
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,680
and I'm going to turn it over to where

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
the negative side is pointing toward his

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
feet that's where the little nub goes

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,580
and I'm going to grab

119
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,659
my soldering iron

120
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,240
and I'm going to grab and just ever so

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,800
gently grab that led and I'm going to

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
heat up that solder that I put up there

123
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,919
on that pad

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,100
and just move that led right into it

125
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,020
and so that's one of the red ones what

126
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm also going to do is I'm going to

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
just rest my tweezers on top and heat

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
that pad up for a third time and you'll

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,540
actually feel that led sink even further

130
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,220
down it's kind of a soldering technique

131
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,320
that'll work really well

132
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,000
and so you'll notice that I put this

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,460
first red LED on the left hand side of

134
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,419
his chest

135
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,120
this other LED again with the nub

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,740
pointing down which means it's kind of

137
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,120
backwards so I'm going to twist it

138
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,800
around

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
LED pointing to his feet is going to

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
come down here on this little pad and so

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,580
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get

142
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,020
right in here

143
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
grab it nice and gently and I'm going to

144
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,699
heat up this solder right here at the

145
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,160
edge and just slide the LED into it

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,620
and then I'm going to rest my LED or my

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,120
tweezers on top of the LED and I'm just

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,860
going to heat it up until it sinks down

149
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,180
flush

150
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,580
and then once I'm done with that

151
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,000
I can take this little bit of solder and

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
I can just put it right at the bottom

153
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
end of that led

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,580
and just touch it with the soldering

155
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,199
iron and that should be all that's

156
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,720
necessary to connect that led

157
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,039
and I'm going to do the same thing up

158
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,620
here with this led so now both of those

159
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,120
if we take a look

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
in the camera both of those LEDs are

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
connected

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,240
in those positions okay again these are

163
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,259
the two red LEDs

164
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,520
um and that's where they go so now what

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,600
we're going to do is we're going to do

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,780
the same exact thing with the green LED

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,160
and it's just going to set to the side

168
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,699
at the top on his chest

169
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,759
so it's a little bit of a pain I'm doing

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,080
this off camera a little bit but

171
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,060
grabbing the green LED

172
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,560
popping it out

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,259
these are super small LEDs to be able to

174
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,120
fit on his chest

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
on here if you look really closely you

176
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,060
can see that nub pointing this way

177
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,919
and so that's the negative side meaning

178
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,900
that that has to be turned around and

179
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,520
pointed toward his feet

180
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,139
and I'm going to set it just right here

181
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,380
on the the PCB so I can get a good hold

182
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,060
of it

183
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,220
get right up here close and I'm going to

184
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,699
grab it

185
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,740
and I'm going to heat up this solder pad

186
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,199
right here and just slide that led into

187
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,280
it

188
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,160
put my tweezers on top and just gently

189
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
resting it and heating that solder one

190
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,580
last time

191
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,440
it kind of lets it sit right down flush

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
with the board I'm going to get my

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
solder now

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,660
and this fine solder makes this a whole

195
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,819
lot easier to work with and I'm just

196
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,259
going to touch

197
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,539
that and on this other side just because

198
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,220
I think I didn't have quite enough

199
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,800
solder I'm going to add just a dab right

200
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,660
there

201
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,199
and so now just like that the green LED

202
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,599
is on there next to the red LED it's not

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,180
perfect not the best solderer in the

204
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,180
world but I can get the job done so next

205
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,500
we're going to put on the resistors for

206
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,180
this and so I'm just going to heat up

207
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,660
one side of this pad here one side of

208
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,699
this pad here and I'll do the top one

209
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,800
over here for good measure and that's

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,280
where the three LEDs

211
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,139
um or or sorry there were three LED

212
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,819
resistors are going to go and so I'm

213
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,979
going to open up this tab with the two

214
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,740
red resistors in it

215
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,599
you can kind of just stick the

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
tweezers in there just be careful not to

217
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,900
push through and poke yourself

218
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,300
but these are two 68 ohm resistors I'm

219
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,199
going to set them right here

220
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,560
and they go

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,140
I'll just kind of set them on the board

222
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,479
and get them all ready

223
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,000
and for this one I'm going to turn him

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,559
this way because it's easier to do this

225
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,240
when you're right-handed

226
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm going to take this little guy

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160
and then I'm going to set him right

228
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,140
actually you know what I better remind

229
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,220
myself real quick which ones go where so

230
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,120
on the back the LED comes out

231
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,640
and goes over

232
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,920
there okay so I'm just following the

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
traces to make sure that I remember

234
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
where

235
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,880
where these things go

236
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,820
and which resistor sinks which

237
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,760
thing okay so the red resistor is the

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,800
one at the top like I thought

239
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,279
so uh 68 Ohm resistor one of them goes

240
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,620
right here at the top

241
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,019
and I'm just heating up that solder pool

242
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,060
and letting that sink down and be flush

243
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,519
I'm gonna grab the other red resistor

244
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,580
and it goes down here on his belt on

245
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,519
this one that's vertical

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,860
for this led so I'm just going to again

247
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,300
heat up this little solder thing and

248
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,880
Slide the resistor in rest my tweezers

249
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,100
gently on top and heat it up one last

250
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,680
time sinks right down and then we'll

251
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,600
take both of these resistors and

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
complete the other side

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,260
with

254
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,560
just a tiny dab of solder there

255
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,019
and a tiny dab of solder there and

256
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,360
that's all that's needed for that

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,880
next we're going to get

258
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,360
the green l or the green resistor

259
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,700
slightly different value if you do mess

260
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,899
this up and they get in the wrong

261
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,459
position it's not going to hurt much

262
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,380
it's just the LEDs won't be the right

263
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,800
brightness all the way across the board

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,040
so 56 Ohm resistor

265
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
comes in right here

266
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
and I'm just going to do the same thing

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
I've done up to this point grab the

268
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,899
thing heat up this

269
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,660
drop that in there rest my tweezers on

270
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,100
it make sure it's flush against the

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,060
board

272
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm going to grab the solder over here

273
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,660
and I'm just going to connect the other

274
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,019
side

275
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,200
and we have all of the hardest LEDs and

276
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,660
components on the front on the board

277
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,480
without any problems or a few problems

278
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,519
right okay the next thing we need to do

279
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,279
is connect the LED filament to the board

280
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,880
the LED filaments inside this container

281
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,220
it's there to keep it from being bent

282
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,680
because they are super fragile

283
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,420
unless they're reinforced with something

284
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,640
so you just kind of carefully open that

285
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,500
up inside

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,660
this is going to be the LED filament

287
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,100
we'll pop it out and you can kind of see

288
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,839
what that looks like a couple of things

289
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,760
for you to recognize and notice about

290
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,940
this on one end there's going to be a

291
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,040
lead that has a little hole in it right

292
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
next to the edge and the other side will

293
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,079
not have a hole in it and so to make

294
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,440
this really easy the side with the hole

295
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,760
goes to the very top of the PCB board so

296
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
it's the top of the lightsaber in order

297
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
to put that in there what you're going

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,860
to want to do is turn this sideways and

299
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,800
very carefully and only one movement

300
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
bend that down so it's at about a 90

301
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,060
degree angle okay and it's super fragile

302
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,060
because that hole will actually break if

303
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,560
you bend that back and forth even more

304
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,600
than once or so and then at the bottom

305
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,399
end you're going to do the same thing

306
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,620
holding the out the filament so you

307
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,019
don't twist it or put pressure on it at

308
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,740
all

309
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,240
and then you're just going to bend this

310
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,339
same one down at that same 90 degree

311
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,420
angle

312
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,640
and then and once you've done that you

313
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,040
can safely grab the PCB and just stick

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,860
the top piece in that top hole and the

315
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
bottom one will fit right there on the

316
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,579
bottom hole oops

317
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,500
kind of popped out you got to be careful

318
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,079
again not to break the filament

319
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,399
and then you're just going to gently

320
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,380
turn it over and set it on the ground

321
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,320
right here so that the the pcb's weight

322
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
is holding it

323
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,180
to the or on the board and then

324
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,639
literally we're just going to add a

325
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,560
little dab of solder to lock it in on

326
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,079
the bottom make sure it's pushed down

327
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
and flush

328
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,459
add a little blob on the top

329
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,339
and then this filament is actually

330
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,279
installed and looking great and so the

331
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,660
important thing is to have it as flush

332
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,220
to the board as possible so that it's

333
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,800
got some structure so you don't crack it

334
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,860
or break it and then at this point that

335
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,779
led filament is in there but we need one

336
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,639
last resistor which is the blue one

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,160
right here in order to turn down the

338
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,560
brightness of that that lightsaber

339
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,480
because without a resistor

340
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,839
of a significant value that thing is as

341
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,079
bright as the Sun so I'm going to take

342
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,120
this this resistor

343
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,860
goes right here

344
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,620
it's a big one it's easy to install

345
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,880
so I'm gonna grab my tweezers

346
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
see if I can do this with my left hand

347
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,779
and we're going to take this

348
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,480
and I'm just going to heat that up

349
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,060
and push that resistor into it again

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,519
rest my tweezers on top heat it up one

351
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,839
more time to make sure it's flush with

352
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,160
the board

353
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,420
and then I'm going to get this little

354
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,160
piece of solder here

355
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,339
and finish this up by

356
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,639
connecting it to the bottom end of that

357
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,680
and then that resistor will tone down

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,740
that led filament just enough to make it

359
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,600
not just overwhelm you

360
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,399
okay last thing we've got to do is put

361
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,500
the pin headers together easiest way to

362
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,660
do this is to just find one of these

363
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,240
boards that you built or you have on

364
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,579
your badge or whatever that has one of

365
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,860
these open positions

366
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,079
and stick

367
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,899
the to the two position headers in the

368
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,980
corners

369
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,260
and then once you do that these will

370
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,180
kind of line right up with where they

371
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,560
need to be

372
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,779
to get a slightly bigger piece of solder

373
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,519
to make this process just a little

374
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,940
easier

375
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
this piece

376
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,779
I'm going to grab my iron and I'm just

377
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,820
going to rest my finger on the board to

378
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,740
keep it flush and I'm just going to add

379
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,300
just a tiny bit of solder at the first

380
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
foot

381
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,459
second position

382
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,380
and then once those are set and cooled

383
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,420
the rest of them should just go pretty

384
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,139
simple and easy

385
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,079
foreign

386
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,980
badge is complete and I don't have a

387
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,779
really good let me see if I can get him

388
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,959
to fire up for you the he uses the clock

389
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,760
on the mini badge and I don't have a

390
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,100
clock on this board but I can most

391
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,800
certainly put some power in here and we

392
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,019
can light up his uh lightsaber let's

393
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,139
just put some power right there some

394
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,540
power right here

395
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,019
oh maybe I pulled him off the three bolt

396
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,660
lead so it's not going to work here but

397
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,339
I promise you it'll work when you stick

398
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,980
it on your badge this is the Darth Vader

399
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,959
mini badge I hope you enjoy it and

400
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,579
