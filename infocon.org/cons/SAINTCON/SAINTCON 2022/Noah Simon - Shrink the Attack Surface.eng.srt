1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,820
all right uh we'll get started

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,620
um thanks to everyone in the room for

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,880
sticking around

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,740
uh if you're doing work that's totally

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,179
cool

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,139
um

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,240
if I say one thing that perks your ears

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
even if you're multitasking I'll deem

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,740
that a success so uh thanks for sticking

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,300
around on a Thursday afternoon my name

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,440
is Noah I'm with a company called

12
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,119
axonius we're going to talk about

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,240
shrinking the attack surface today I

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
think a topic that's

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,000
super important to dive into

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
um so I wanted to start by Framing it

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,579
this way which is actually with the

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,340
second law of thermodynamics

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,399
now disclaimer I am not a physicist I

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,180
can't tell you everything about

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,860
thermodynamics

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,120
um I bet there's someone in the audience

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,460
who might be able to uh educate me on

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,320
thermodynamics but if you boil it down

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
the second law of Thermodynamics it

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,980
essentially states that everything gets

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,559
more complex over time

28
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,160
um

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
when I'm thinking about the attack

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,879
surface I think this Rings true right

31
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,140
and this is kind of the frame of

32
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,359
reference that really helps me think

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
about the attack surface everything's

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,360
becoming more complex whether that's

35
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,820
attack Behavior whether that's the

36
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,260
technology environment that we're all

37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,680
tasked to secure so this is really a

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,960
good frame of reference for today's talk

39
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,000
so I'm going to talk about uh what is

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,159
the attack surface and how's it changing

41
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,180
so

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,340
let's all Define it first so that we all

43
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,140
kind of see it the same way and then

44
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,600
obviously how's it changing today and

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,740
how does it change over the last few

46
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,360
years

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,439
and then I want to spend most of the

48
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,420
time thinking about fundamentals on

49
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,939
shrinking the attack surface there's a

50
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,619
lot of steps that we can take that are

51
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,560
fundamental to actually reduce the risk

52
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,119
of exposure reduce the risk of

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,060
compromise and happy to take any q a and

54
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,040
if if anyone has any at the end

55
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
so attack surface 101

56
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,340
um here's a basic definition of attack

57
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,079
surface

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,759
when I boil it down I think of an attack

59
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,340
surface as everything you have in all

60
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,500
the ways that they possibly could be

61
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,239
compromised

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,520
so all entry points that can compromise

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,400
any or all assets

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm curious if anyone has a different

65
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,540
definition or if this kind of sounds

66
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,459
similar to the way you might think about

67
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,480
an attack surface

68
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,959
I don't see a lot of disagreements so

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,760
um with that

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,319
a provocative statement that I don't

71
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,420
really believe is that provocative right

72
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,340
I don't think any one organization can

73
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,500
defend their entire attack surface right

74
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,819
so that's why we're talking today about

75
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,920
shrinking it right controlling what you

76
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,319
can to reduce uh to reduce that attack

77
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,760
surface

78
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,000
a company can have all the tools all the

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,280
Personnel in the world but with today's

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,860
digital environment uh simply covering

81
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,840
everything is not really possible I

82
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,980
think we all know this so

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,080
so how's the attack surface changed

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,239
um obviously if you went back 10 15

85
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,459
years ago

86
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,540
digital environments were pretty pretty

87
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
simple right you had endpoints you had

88
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,220
servers within a traditional Network

89
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,000
for company walls maybe a firewall

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
um and securing this environment was a

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,099
lot more simple than it is today so this

92
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,680
is you know 10 15 years ago obviously A

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,959
lot's changed over time we added mobile

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,099
we added multiple identities we added

95
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,519
custom and internet-facing applications

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,340
we added all sorts of digital uh assets

97
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,300
including websites

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,299
if you look at it closer to today uh

99
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,640
it's obviously expanded much more right

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
we have digital Supply chains we have

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,340
um third and fourth party vendors we

102
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,379
have iot devices that are connected to

103
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,700
corporate networks and also home

104
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,780
networks

105
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,900
we have obviously collaboration tools on

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
the right hand side we have cloud

107
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,680
workloads and SAS applications which

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
have absolutely exploded in the last few

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,260
years with SAS spend actually

110
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,500
surpassing Cloud infrastructure spend

111
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,420
um so this is no surprise to anyone

112
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,739
really I think everyone's familiar with

113
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,540
how the attack surfaces expanded but

114
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,918
when I mean that everything's become

115
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,779
more complex this really helps you

116
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,940
visualize the complexity of what that

117
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,680
attack surface is and how it keeps

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,100
expanding

119
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,340
I also want to briefly

120
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,160
um keep in mind how do attackers uh

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,780
think right

122
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,520
we know that most attackers go after the

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,740
Past after the path of least resistance

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,419
so you can see this chart here on the

125
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,220
right this is from the uh the latest

126
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,500
Verizon data breach investigation report

127
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,600
you can see that most attackers start

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,060
with the basics right just scanning for

129
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,340
something that's public facing anything

130
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,520
that's communicating out to the internet

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,259
they might use Automation in the form of

132
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,000
crawlers or Bots right to try and

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
compromise an application or again

134
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,259
anything that's public facing uh that

135
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,600
they can easily find

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,460
and then as you get down to more

137
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,960
sophisticated methods right you have

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,100
your your malware uh your exploits and

139
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,060
your exploits against known

140
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
vulnerabilities

141
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,660
and so these are really the methods that

142
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
we want to minimize right when I get

143
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,300
into the fundamentals I'll talk about

144
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,160
what are the fundamentals that can

145
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,500
counteract these common attack vectors

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
so four steps in terms of fundamentals

147
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,740
in my view uh the first is continuous

148
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,720
and comprehensive asset Discovery it's

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
really hard to uh shrink an attack

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,680
surface if you don't know what your tax

151
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,840
service looks like and knowing what your

152
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,979
attack surface looks like really

153
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,400
requires a really good grasp on asset

154
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,880
discovery

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,380
once you've discovered those assets

156
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,380
right applying security controls uh

157
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,360
wherever you can so ensuring that you

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,759
have good security control coverage

159
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,860
across the assets you've discovered is

160
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,020
also in my view very fundamental

161
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
you gotta also validate those security

162
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,740
controls right it's one thing to just

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,600
deploy a security control it's another

164
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,580
to actually test it ensure that it's

165
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,919
actually working as designed and

166
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,719
detecting known attack Behavior

167
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,819
and then step four finally you've uh

168
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,440
deployed security controls you've tested

169
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,180
them they're working you're always going

170
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,340
to have some residual risk right you're

171
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,080
always going to have some known

172
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,660
vulnerabilities in your environment and

173
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,940
you have to go about prioritizing what

174
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,639
matters most right like I said no one

175
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,580
can ever fix 100 of what they know so

176
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,199
how do you go about prioritizing the

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,539
residual risk that might exist after

178
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,220
you've applied and validated security

179
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,880
controls

180
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,080
foreign

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,940
so let's talk about that first step

182
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,680
continuous and comprehensive asset

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,660
Discovery so

184
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,819
when I'm talking about assets assets

185
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,259
might mean different things to different

186
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,280
people

187
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,940
um

188
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,680
in my view some of the common things

189
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,840
that people are likely looking at are

190
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,940
obviously devices right physical virtual

191
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
iot OT

192
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,919
workstations

193
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,900
connected medical devices right this

194
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,520
could be totally different depending on

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,039
the line of work you're in and the kind

196
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,300
of work that your company does

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
it could also be your network

198
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,060
infrastructure right your routers your

199
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,099
firewalls your switches anything that

200
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,259
actually controls network access for the

201
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,500
devices

202
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,220
obviously it's going to be your Cloud

203
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
infrastructure if you're using cloud

204
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,759
service providers if you're using

205
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,340
platform as a service applications

206
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,139
um those are part of your attack surface

207
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,560
right you may not be required to secure

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,539
the actual infrastructure itself but

209
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,580
you're probably required for securing

210
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,620
the access the data that goes through it

211
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,900
if you're all familiar with the cloud

212
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,159
shared responsibility model

213
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
it's also now SAS applications I

214
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
mentioned that the attack surface is

215
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,440
expanding SAS applications in my opinion

216
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,240
is one of the biggest vectors in which

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
the attack surface is expanding so you

218
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
see this graphic here on the right this

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,259
is a common visual of what the average

220
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,479
company has in terms of SAS applications

221
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,120
most companies now have hundreds of SAS

222
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
applications their employees use whether

223
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,919
they know them all or whether they don't

224
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,979
um so this is an interesting area where

225
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,720
attack surface is expanding and

226
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,699
inventorying SAS apps is now becoming

227
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,640
pretty critical to understanding where

228
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,500
your data resides and how to secure it

229
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,958
your employees are obviously part of

230
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,599
your attack surface too uh and in terms

231
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,880
of assets right you can deem user

232
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,680
accounts or an identities your employee

233
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
accounts the way they access corporate

234
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,959
applications devices those are assets

235
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,459
you want to inventory and track

236
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,720
of course code repositories for obvious

237
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,920
reasons

238
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,420
I think there's many more right I could

239
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,399
I could list web certificates I could

240
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
list many other things but when we're

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,940
talking about asset Discovery these are

242
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,160
some of the things that I I deem pretty

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,620
critical to get a hold of on a frequent

244
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,120
basis

245
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,140
um as part of continuous and

246
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,399
comprehensive asset discovery

247
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,300
so how do you actually get comprehensive

248
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,339
and continuous asset Discovery right a

249
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,899
lot of teams are still using

250
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,200
spreadsheets or you know databases as an

251
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
asset repository to understand what they

252
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,980
have and that's a good start it's good

253
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,260
to have that rather than nothing but

254
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,240
what we really find is that fetching

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,580
data from multiple perspectives is very

256
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,380
important right you might have a scanner

257
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,019
that goes out and identifies assets and

258
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,519
that's really great but how often are

259
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,980
you running that scanner

260
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,779
that could be a monthly basis that could

261
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,399
be even less than a monthly basis for a

262
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,000
lot of companies

263
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,640
someone's cheering me on over there

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,920
um you could also have uh you know

265
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,320
directory Services you can have uh

266
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,060
agents that exist on devices there's so

267
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,580
many perspectives on so many data

268
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,320
sources that you probably have on your

269
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,459
assets

270
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,839
um that just exists in different places

271
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,279
right

272
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,140
so fetching data from all these various

273
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,060
perspectives unifying that data in some

274
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,940
way really helps actually drive more

275
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,620
comprehensive asset Discovery rather

276
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,180
than relying on one or two source

277
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,200
um fetching data on frequent intervals I

278
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,339
just mentioned scanning is a great

279
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,380
method but not everyone can scan every

280
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,440
day so understanding what data you have

281
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
you might be able to glean network data

282
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
on a near real-time basis you might be

283
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,100
able to fetch information about your

284
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,080
Cloud infrastructure again on a nearer

285
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
near real-time basis as you probably

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
need to given the dynamic nature of

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
cloud so being able to actually fetch

288
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
this data on a continuous basis is also

289
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,899
important

290
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,700
and then being able to just tag which

291
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,140
assets are critical right you've

292
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,600
gathered a wide array of assets you

293
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
understand which assets are unique

294
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,959
within your environment but tagging

295
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,519
those critical ones is important because

296
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,140
you know that you're going to focus on

297
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,600
these as you monitor over time

298
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
is that second fundamental that I

299
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,779
mentioned is security security control

300
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,880
coverage so

301
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
the premise here is that any asset that

302
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,260
misses a security control increases your

303
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,480
attack service right earlier I Define

304
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,860
the attack surface as everything you

305
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,180
have plus all the ways that could be

306
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,360
compromised and the security controls uh

307
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,820
help reduce the ways that they can be

308
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
compromised for obvious reasons

309
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
this is the biggest area that I believe

310
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,579
companies can reduce their attack

311
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,079
surface right we can't necessarily

312
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,120
shrink the number of assets we have in

313
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,100
our environment we can't go to the cios

314
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,320
of the world and say let's stop using so

315
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,899
much Cloud we can't stop going to our

316
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,579
employees and say you know stop buying

317
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,100
all these SAS applications for obvious

318
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,800
reasons but we can put controls wherever

319
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,220
we um wherever we can appropriately and

320
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,779
trying to reduce the methods that

321
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,100
attackers might be able to actually

322
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,100
exploit these assets

323
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,800
so a laundry list of security controls

324
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
obviously not every company has all of

325
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
these but as you go across that asset

326
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
inventory that you've conducted that

327
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
you're fetching on a continuous basis

328
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,579
it's important to understand where do

329
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,740
these exist and where they not exist

330
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,260
as a company we talk to so many people

331
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,000
who believe they have a really good

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,019
handle on how frequ how widely they've

333
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,140
deployed something like an EDR solution

334
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,820
um later it turns out they get more

335
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,320
asset information they understand more

336
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,579
of what they have and it turns out it's

337
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,399
on 30 to 40 percent of the workstations

338
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,779
that they intend to deploy something

339
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,060
like an EDR agent on

340
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,760
so this is a really really immediate way

341
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,579
to my in my opinion uh start to shrink

342
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,620
that attack surface is to really improve

343
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,660
security control coverage wherever you

344
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,060
can right I mentioned EDR uh

345
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,860
vulnerability assessment uh ensuring

346
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,740
that your vulnerability assessment scans

347
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,440
cover a large scope of assets as far as

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
they can

349
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,279
mobile device management if your

350
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,320
employees are using their mobile devices

351
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,600
to access corporate resources this is a

352
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
pretty critical Security Control in my

353
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,880
view

354
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,300
um we can go further down the list but

355
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,220
all of these are things to think about I

356
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,959
think security awareness training and

357
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,760
phishing protection these aren't really

358
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,019
necessarily thought of as security

359
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,579
controls a lot of times but your

360
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,200
employees as I mentioned earlier are

361
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,399
part of your attack service so

362
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,500
understanding what percentage of your

363
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
employees have actually recently gone

364
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,160
through a security awareness training in

365
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,100
the last you know 90 days being able to

366
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,720
understand security control coverage in

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,480
that manner is also important

368
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,339
phishing protection as well Network

369
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,660
segmentation

370
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,760
again a lot of these things you might

371
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,620
not have as a company but whatever you

372
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,180
do have you want to understand how

373
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,859
widely used and deployed is it

374
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,899
so security control validation I

375
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:58,980
mentioned you want to deploy those

376
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,959
security controls to reduce the risk of

377
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,579
compromise you also want to actually

378
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,560
validate that they're working right you

379
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,880
can't just set and forget these things

380
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,600
obviously they require maintenance

381
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,399
so what do I mean by something that you

382
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,660
want to validate in terms of security

383
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,519
control first the versions on which

384
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,260
they're running right a lot of things

385
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,440
like an EDR agent are updated very

386
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
frequently to be hardened against the

387
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,740
latest attacks

388
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,120
um if you're not running the currently

389
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,459
supported version of these types of

390
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,079
Technologies they might be more

391
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,380
vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks

392
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,480
they also just might not be reporting

393
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,420
back to a central Management console as

394
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,920
designed right sometimes you deploy

395
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
something and the connection back to a

396
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,180
Management console since a lot of these

397
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,399
things are SAS based actually gets

398
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,680
broken whether that's unintentional or

399
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,079
intentional we all know that a lot of

400
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,260
attacks after attackers have gotten a

401
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,000
foothold within a network will disable

402
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,220
something like an antivirus right and

403
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,480
then they'll later go through the

404
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,000
network and transverse it without being

405
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
detected

406
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,060
so you want to actually ensure that

407
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,880
these things such as an EDR agent are

408
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,339
actually reporting back and actually are

409
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,519
working on a frequent basis

410
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
and then actually just looking at

411
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,240
looking uh to make sure that they're

412
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
actually configured correctly right

413
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,560
another common example in the endpoint

414
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,339
security world is a company will buy a

415
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,620
new security security agent and they'll

416
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,199
run it in detection only mode just to

417
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,600
get a feel for the alerts and to get a

418
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,060
feel for the maintenance of the solution

419
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,100
and then over time they'll transition

420
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,839
that over to prevention mode

421
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,779
but as you grow with a large company it

422
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,160
becomes very hard to actually verify

423
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
that everything was switched over to

424
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,980
prevention mode if that's the decision

425
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,060
you made

426
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,040
so that's one example of ensuring that

427
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
the proper policies are applied right

428
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
you could think of this in terms of

429
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,240
encryption as well making sure that

430
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,620
devices are actually turned on with

431
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
encryption

432
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,139
there's various ways you can think about

433
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,000
this I've provided a lot of examples in

434
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,860
the terms of endpoint security because

435
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,380
that's what I know well but these are

436
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,240
great examples of things you actually

437
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,959
want to validate

438
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,880
there's a lot of ways you can go about

439
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,380
validating these right a lot of this

440
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,600
will come out in various exercises like

441
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,940
a pen test or red team exercise and

442
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,320
these are really great

443
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
um the thing I often see though with pen

444
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,699
tests and Red Team exercises is that's

445
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,019
not necessarily across your entire

446
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,519
attack surface right these are usually

447
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,279
Limited in scope uh obviously to control

448
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,000
costs or to just to control the findings

449
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
and these might only be conducted across

450
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,639
a certain portion of your actual entire

451
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,500
attack surface

452
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,639
they're also a point in time right

453
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
nobody's doing a pen tests on a daily

454
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,639
basis

455
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,500
um and so while you'll get really deep

456
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,180
results out of them you know their point

457
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
in time so you might find something and

458
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,920
90 days later those findings are almost

459
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,139
um completely different

460
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,459
there's other things like breaching

461
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,980
attack simulations these are also great

462
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,720
right but these are also periodic you

463
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,880
can do them perhaps more frequently than

464
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,759
red team exercises or pen tests but

465
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,619
again those are kind of periodic

466
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,900
there is a way to continuously monitor

467
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,959
this stuff right you can actually marry

468
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,459
what you have in terms of security

469
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,579
controls against all the assets you own

470
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,079
so monitoring that security control

471
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,079
coverage actually running conditions to

472
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,199
identify things like security agents

473
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,880
that are out of date or that aren't

474
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,619
reporting back there's a way to monitor

475
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,599
all this stuff and to actually find it

476
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
as it happens rather than whenever your

477
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,540
next pen test is

478
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,580
all right so I'm at the fourth

479
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,559
um fundamental and this is all about

480
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,120
vulnerability and risk prioritization

481
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,100
right you've deployed security controls

482
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,440
well sorry you first understood your

483
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,179
attack surface first and foremost you've

484
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,860
deployed security controls and you've

485
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,240
actually validated them

486
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,559
that's not going to prevent everything

487
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
everyone knows that so you have to look

488
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,059
at what's left over and how you

489
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,960
prioritize that

490
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,280
there's always going to be more

491
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,299
vulnerabilities than there are people

492
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,860
that patch them I don't think that's a

493
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,260
controversial statement at all

494
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,580
um hopefully none of the statements I've

495
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,900
said today are controversial but I'm

496
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,539
happy to debate that in Q a or after the

497
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,260
fact

498
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,960
what I put here on the right is from

499
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,640
also the latest Verizon database

500
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,440
investigation report it tells us a lot

501
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,480
about the attack surface in my opinion

502
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
and what you see is that breached

503
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,320
organizations and also organizations

504
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,020
that had a ransomware event on average

505
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,059
had more vulnerabilities per host than

506
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,980
those that didn't which is not at all

507
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,480
surprising

508
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,299
but what it tells us is getting that uh

509
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,220
count of little vulnerabilities per host

510
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,919
down right would reduce the likelihood

511
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,280
of breach in theory

512
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,720
so while you can't patch everything

513
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,580
while you can't reduce every single

514
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,980
vulnerability you can reduce the ones

515
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,960
that matter most and there's many ways

516
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,720
of thinking of doing that I listed a few

517
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,660
here right CVSs almost everyone has this

518
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,820
at their disposal a good starting place

519
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,740
to think about what's an important

520
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,900
vulnerability to look at

521
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,880
there's a lot more you can layer on top

522
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,340
of it exploit likelihood this kind of

523
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,760
data has become very accessible sisa

524
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,380
obviously just put out their known

525
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,260
exploited uh vulnerabilities list anyone

526
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,520
can go up there and grab that and

527
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
understand which vulnerabilities are

528
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,059
actually being exploited in the wild

529
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,700
there's other organizations that have

530
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,860
open source intelligence about which

531
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,419
vulnerabilities are being exploited in

532
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,940
the wild so anyone can get use out of

533
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,559
that data

534
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,299
you also want to track things like

535
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,179
vulnerability age right so how old are

536
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,500
the vulnerabilities that exist your

537
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,600
environment the reason being here is a

538
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,919
lot of the vulnerabilities that are

539
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,419
actually exploited are sometimes several

540
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,460
years old so everyone's usually

541
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,900
concerned about the zero days like a log

542
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,960
for Jay but a lot of the ones that get

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,720
exploited and hurt companies on an

544
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,400
individual basis are these

545
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
vulnerabilities that are several years

546
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,820
old

547
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,559
of course you want to layer all this

548
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,480
Logic on top of your environment on top

549
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,100
of your attack surface right so thinking

550
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,900
about which assets are internal facing

551
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,600
versus those that are actually publicly

552
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,120
facing the internet and could be

553
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,340
um exploited by an attacker without any

554
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,220
foothold in your network

555
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,960
and then in my opinion most important

556
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,640
asset criticality right I mentioned

557
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,280
tagging those critical assets earlier

558
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
being able to understand anytime there's

559
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,780
a vulnerability on a host that's deemed

560
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,880
critical to the company

561
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,200
seems like an obvious thing to

562
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,900
prioritize over anything else

563
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,700
and then compensating security controls

564
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,840
right I talked a lot about security

565
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,900
controls today it's important to be able

566
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,820
to discern whether an active

567
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,520
vulnerability on a critical asset

568
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,140
does or doesn't have a security control

569
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,880
right that might choose how you

570
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,120
prioritize it a vulnerability that's

571
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,460
found on a host that also has endpoint

572
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,660
prevention

573
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,480
if you do some due diligence perhaps

574
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
that endpoint prevention agent can block

575
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
that exploit for that vulnerability

576
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,320
outright right so you want to take into

577
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,580
consideration where your security

578
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,980
controls exist obviously hoping that

579
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,320
they're validated as well as asset

580
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,460
criticality

581
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,840
so there's a lot of ways you can think

582
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,860
about vulnerability and risk

583
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,539
prioritization I think a lot of

584
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,000
companies are getting super Advanced uh

585
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,760
in this practice and really determining

586
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,400
logic in terms of their own organization

587
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,520
and not just CVSs score or what

588
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,500
um specific vendors say out of the box

589
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,240
uh in terms of what they should

590
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,720
prioritize

591
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,039
so in summary I mentioned the attack

592
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,100
surface is getting more complex it's

593
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
expanding there's nothing really we can

594
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
do to control that expansion technology

595
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,220
over time obviously becomes more and

596
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,679
more expansive and harder to get a grasp

597
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,960
on but we can leverage an 80 20 mindset

598
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,240
in my opinion I think focusing on those

599
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
fundamentals really leveraging that 20

600
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,600
of effort to get 80 of impact is a

601
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
mentality that in my opinion everyone

602
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
should consider employing

603
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
I think it's kind of necessary these

604
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,900
days just given the pace of technology

605
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,940
and uh the job we all have to secure

606
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,620
that attack surface

607
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,880
so in my opinion again those

608
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,860
fundamentals it comprehensive and

609
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,020
continuous view into your attack surface

610
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,120
it starts here you can't really secure

611
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,460
anything if you don't know what you have

612
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,020
and then really understanding your

613
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,340
security controls how they perform and

614
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,780
prioritizing any residual risk in the

615
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,880
form of vulnerabilities or anything else

616
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,799
that you find after you've validated

617
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,820
those security controls

618
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,580
without them happy to take any questions

619
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,500
if there aren't any if not again thank

620
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,539
you for uh sitting through on a Thursday

621
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,799
afternoon I know the conference is

622
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,840
almost wrapping up here and tomorrow so

623
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,220
thank you all for your time

624
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,989
[Applause]
