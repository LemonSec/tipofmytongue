1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
I'm Josh Linton as I've been up here

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,500
staring at these lights I thought I do

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,760
not

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,639
stand in front of spotlights that often

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,280
and I thought why don't I do that and

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,320
then I remembered it's the reflection of

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
the head that really is not it's not

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,000
flattering so I apologize for anybody

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,300
who has to deal with that in your eyes

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,420
but I'm glad to be here Josh Linton with

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,119
Valcom and I really want to talk about

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,040
some

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,860
strategies for cyber security but I

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,300
wanted to start out with with a story

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,120
about five years ago I got a call from a

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,200
CEO

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,579
and uh he's in a panic

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,340
he had just seen a check try to clear in

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,140
his bank account for fifty thousand

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,640
dollars

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,500
and normally you don't want to check to

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,840
bounce this one did he only had about

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
forty thousand dollars in his bank he

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,300
had recently within kind of a week of

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,879
that had just withdrawn

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,019
um

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,240
it's about thirty thousand dollars to

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
get them below the fifty and he says the

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
problem is I didn't write this check

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,600
and I don't know how anybody got into my

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,760
bank account to

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,700
um to do this so we started to

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,540
uh do a little bit of research and uh so

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm asking him and said you what other

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,680
computers do you use do you log into

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,340
your bank account from your phone and uh

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,939
he says no it I have my laptop and

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,659
that's it right all I do is

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,259
um

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,299
I log in for my laptop I don't even log

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,799
in for my phone I don't share with

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,979
anybody and uh

43
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,900
so we're I'm trying to figure out if he

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,180
if somebody's got a key logger how are

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,899
they accessing this information right

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,000
and then I ask if he keeps his passwords

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,320
anywhere

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,899
now this is an older gentleman

49
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,939
so I was thinking that he might keep him

50
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,299
on post a note under his keyboard

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,700
for good or bad he didn't it would have

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,140
been better in this case but he was

53
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,598
keeping them on a note on his phone

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,739
right and his phone was pretty private

55
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,500
but this note was sinking to his Office

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,020
365 account

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,680
right and as we uh I did not figure it

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,840
out this fast for the record it took me

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,420
a little longer than that but uh as we

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,099
kind of did some research turned out

61
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,620
about three weeks prior to this uh he

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,239
had received an email with a shared

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,599
document and uh he had clicked on it put

64
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,819
his uh

65
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,959
his credentials in and immediately

66
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,060
recognized that it was fraudulent so he

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,400
called the help desk and got his

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,459
password changed so he was compromised

69
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,120
for maybe 10 minutes right in those 10

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,120
minutes the the Bad actors were able to

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,879
download as enough data that they

72
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,739
quickly identified his notes with his

73
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,080
passwords and had logged into his bank

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,800
account created a new uh bill pay

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,840
recipient and had written themselves a

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,140
check and if he had

77
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,819
luckily withdrawn some of that that

78
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,280
money from that account uh he would have

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,019
uh lost that

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,120
this was four years ago

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,319
and

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,620
interesting part is different CEO I got

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,560
a very similar call just a month two

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,780
months ago

85
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,459
somebody had

86
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,060
sent an email to their customer

87
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,420
from their email domain asking them to

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,060
change where they sent their uh

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,480
multiple hundred thousand dollar payment

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,900
right at that point you're in in many of

91
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,640
these cases you're hoping your business

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
can survive some of these things right

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,659
I'm probably not sharing anything you

94
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,080
don't know but everyone this it's it's

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
serious business everyone's a Target

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,019
um whether it's a business personal and

97
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,720
uh as we talk today about the cyber

98
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
security strategies it really is your

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,659
data your business that is the key uh to

100
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,199
your to your success as a as business uh

101
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,180
as businesses so one thing that I wanted

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,160
to kind of get by raise of hands who

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,100
here is in uh leadership positions raise

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,500
bands okay

105
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,860
uh sis admins kind of admin positions

106
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,840
and then I know that lots of students

107
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,580
how many we have some students in this

108
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
in this session nope one that's good

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,820
kind of students that's fair right my

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,380
wife's a student she's going back to

111
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,400
school

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,320
she will not be here though she's a

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,680
nurse different program uh what we want

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
to talk about are eight strategies for

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
uh preparing your company for cyber

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,220
security attack and we'll talk about

117
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,100
these in priority but really the the the

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,320
trick with cyber security is in many

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,139
cases it's not about if you're there's

120
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,639
going to be a breach or some sort of

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,580
security incident it's about when right

122
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,139
and so

123
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,500
having a strategy for protecting

124
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,280
your business is probably it's the best

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,160
you can do a determined criminal is

126
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,740
probably going to get in anyway right we

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,120
just don't want to make it easy for them

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,580
right so as we talk about this we'll use

129
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,740
This Acronym safe Pace we'll go through

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,979
each of these security availability

131
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,020
flexibility and extensibility and then

132
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,180
policy audit compliance and education

133
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,280
we'll talk a little bit about each of

134
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,380
these and how they might apply to your

135
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,580
business

136
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,240
um

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,960
so let's start first with security this

138
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,520
one may be

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,620
the most basic and at a security

140
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,960
conference may not need to be said or

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
we're going to say it anyway right and

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,580
that is you have to take a secure

143
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,979
approach securing your devices securing

144
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,639
your network access physical security

145
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,560
all of these things are so important and

146
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,199
making sure that you are setting

147
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,560
yourself up for for success in this area

148
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,380
all right one of the big uh

149
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,660
challenges and maybe you don't want to

150
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,520
raise your hands here but how many of

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,080
you have dealt with a ransomware attack

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,560
from someone else right no yeah don't

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,900
raise your hands we deal with them all

154
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,479
the time we've we have our we will

155
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,460
typically have

156
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,039
um I'll bet we get a call a month from a

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,139
different customer earlier in the year I

158
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,280
feel like we were getting them almost

159
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,860
every week with somebody having a

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,780
ransomware incident they're trying to

161
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,699
recover their data or trying to

162
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,340
determine whether or not they want to

163
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,960
um

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
pay their Anthem try to recover the FBI

165
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,060
says don't pay

166
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,819
because every time we pay them

167
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,699
we just kind of the cycle continues they

168
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,300
make money they do it again and they do

169
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,180
a better job next time right

170
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,900
and this security and preparing is

171
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,600
really the the very beginning of a

172
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,800
journey to secure your environment uh

173
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,979
and so you'll want

174
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,319
this is sorry it was one slide behind

175
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,080
there uh veeam pulled a thousand it

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,740
companies all of them who had had a

177
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,599
cyber security incident

178
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,880
73 percent of them

179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,080
in 2021 had two or more incidents of

180
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,580
ransomware

181
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,400
right 68 of those

182
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,940
their backups were also compromised

183
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,039
that's a major problem anybody who's

184
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
experienced ransomware the really good

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,259
uh Bad actors

186
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,240
they're going to wait until they have

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
access to your backup data because then

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
they know you have to pay

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,620
right without a good way to recover from

190
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,500
ransomware paying that Ransom may be the

191
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,880
only way that you can keep your business

192
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,759
in business right and so uh and then 32

193
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,979
percent of those that paid the ransom

194
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,340
were not able to get all their data back

195
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,460
so it's uh

196
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,220
and ransomware is just one one example

197
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,500
maybe one of the most prolific right now

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,379
but it's a major issue and so you need

199
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,479
to be prepared for ransomware and this

200
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,979
is one of the things

201
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,419
but I want you to take away if there's

202
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,699
one thing you take away from this are

203
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,099
these questions right

204
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,500
to ask yourself and then to ask your

205
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,440
team and uh a marketing team did a great

206
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,020
job they actually uh created some PDFs

207
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,440
two PDFs one for you as a leader and one

208
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,600
for your team

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,740
at the end I'll put a link you can just

210
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,620
you can download those and take them

211
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,640
back

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,019
and

213
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,339
um

214
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,140
ask your team these questions and

215
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,760
compare them and that's really the key

216
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
right how confident am I that my system

217
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,620
is secure that current threats are

218
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,959
prevented how confident am I that if

219
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,940
there is a security breach that we can

220
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,180
rapidly recover and mitigate any damage

221
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,459
how confident am I that my team knows

222
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,899
what they need to do in order to provide

223
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,399
ongoing security for our critical

224
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
systems right and then as you ask your

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,060
team these same things right uh

226
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,220
that I think is where you will see a lot

227
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,440
of areas for improvement

228
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
where there's a discrepancy between what

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
you believe

230
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,100
is happening and what your team believes

231
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,860
is happening right and you rank that on

232
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,140
a scale of one to ten and now you have

233
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,260
an opportunity to go and start making

234
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,700
some improvements in your security

235
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,040
policy and procedures

236
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
uh

237
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,459
now if you have questions throughout

238
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,620
this I will not take the full 45 minutes

239
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,779
so if you have a question raise your

240
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,820
hand I can address it now or we can do

241
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,980
it at the end whatever feels most

242
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,140
relevant for for the question uh so

243
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,500
next let's talk about availability

244
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,560
um

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,779
prior to covid

246
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,680
at our office we might have had uh 25 of

247
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,880
our employees that had kind of VPN and

248
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,560
and remote access

249
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,839
to to the data

250
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,180
prior to covet a hundred percent of our

251
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,000
employees can work part-time uh at least

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,580
part of the time from home right this

253
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,480
availability requirement and uh is is

254
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,300
key it has been for some people for a

255
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,120
long time for us covet forced it on us

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,000
and now that data needs to be available

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,620
24 7 to all of our employees right and

258
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,300
uh

259
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,100
one of the things to consider in

260
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,160
availability is what it costs you in

261
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,220
downtime right and one of the things I'm

262
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,459
always wary of in presentations is what

263
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,320
I like to call marketing math

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
that is if you buy my product you're

265
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,339
going to save a million dollars that

266
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,440
whole thing at some level it's probably

267
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,320
true right but for each of you as you

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,060
take these these numbers and this is why

269
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,940
we kind of did it this way is that

270
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,459
um you just take your annual revenue and

271
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,140
you divide it by the number of hours if

272
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,459
you're a 24x7 operation that's 87.60 and

273
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:24,959
if you're an eight by five operation

274
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,740
it's 2080 that gives you your Revenue

275
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,060
per hour

276
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,700
that would be a potential loss in

277
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,279
revenue for downtime so 100 for example

278
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,320
100 million dollar company

279
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,380
uh that is eight by five

280
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,019
if they 10 hours of downtime cost them

281
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,480
480 000 in Revenue

282
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,019
right and so as you

283
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,300
calculate this that doesn't count that

284
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,740
doesn't take into account lost

285
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,459
productivity or redirected

286
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,040
um resources as you're trying to resolve

287
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,680
these types of of situations right so

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,019
the availability isn't just something to

289
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,260
to help the company grow but it costs

290
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,160
money right and uh unplanned downtime

291
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,779
really becomes something that's that's

292
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,060
not an acceptable

293
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,640
situation for most companies and for us

294
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
one thing that we learned quickly this

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,140
is prior to covid uh we got a call in

296
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,000
fact it wasn't a call the fire

297
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,440
department came into our building and

298
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,360
they said you need to get everybody out

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,260
of here

300
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,120
and we said is there a fire they said oh

301
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,000
no but there could be there's a gas leak

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,860
right outside your building and everyone

303
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,899
has to leave until the gas company can

304
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,220
come fix it

305
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,560
and then we can clear the building

306
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,899
you would think that would be fast

307
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,700
it was not

308
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,480
uh and for me well for any of you I

309
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,160
imagine when some when there's an issue

310
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
you jump on these things right away it

311
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
took about I think it was 24 or 48 hours

312
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,880
before we could bring everybody back

313
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,980
into our building well during that time

314
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,139
we only had 25 percent of our employees

315
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,180
that were able to continue to work right

316
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,920
the amount of lost productivity that

317
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,459
that cost us as well as the challenges

318
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,019
when everybody came back trying to get

319
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,880
caught up right

320
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
uh is kind of a recipe for additional

321
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,100
errors rushing through some of these

322
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,620
things right so availability becomes an

323
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,899
important uh part of your overall plan

324
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,019
um

325
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,839
and and that's really uh from if you

326
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,300
don't have one additional thing that

327
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,579
you'll want to

328
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,260
think about is a business continuity

329
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,220
plan

330
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,440
how many of you know what a tabletop

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
exercise is yeah

332
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,459
uh if you're not doing those regularly

333
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,220
you need to be that that's an area in

334
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,360
which as you build your business

335
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,839
continuity plan and you can kind of run

336
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,220
through that exercise and say okay what

337
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,260
are we going to do when there's a gas

338
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,300
leak or what do we do if there's a fire

339
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,100
or an earthquake and you can run through

340
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,079
those scenarios to make sure that you're

341
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,800
addressing the issues uh that

342
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,079
that might be part of your organization

343
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,839
but that you're prepared for those

344
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,000
issues as well right and that your

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,339
environment is prepared

346
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,980
uh and we're back to these these

347
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,899
questions right how confident uh are you

348
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,700
that your I.T system will remain up and

349
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,560
available regardless of what might

350
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,720
happen right

351
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,579
uh how confident am I that my system

352
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,560
goes down from a technical failure and

353
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,139
disaster or breach that my team can get

354
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,420
it operational before it impacts the

355
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,599
business

356
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,199
and then for your team these same

357
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,079
questions right

358
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,579
be interesting to see if these are

359
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,880
different for your organization

360
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,100
flexibility

361
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,500
how many of you

362
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,180
well you don't have to answer this

363
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,519
question if you've been in this in in it

364
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,399
for maybe longer than 10 or 15 years

365
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,920
I remember the time when

366
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
uh we did not have to be flexible

367
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
IT director said here's how it's going

368
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
to be and you're going to do it my way

369
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,839
and

370
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,399
that's pretty much how it goes that's

371
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,800
how we maintain security around here

372
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,180
right

373
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,360
uh no you can't have an iPad it's not

374
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,560
secure

375
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,139
no you can have one computer only

376
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,320
that is not the case anymore right

377
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,180
most users have two three plus devices

378
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,820
we can't control that right we have to

379
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,720
be flexible and we have to be prepared

380
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,459
uh to

381
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,519
adapt to the needs of our

382
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,279
uh

383
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,500
our users right I call them our

384
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,540
customers our internal customers right

385
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,240
that's who we're supporting one of the

386
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,360
challenges with this is also Shadow I.T

387
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,740
how many of you are dealing with Shadow

388
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,699
I.T

389
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,560
yeah

390
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,420
um

391
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,399
our marketing director might be in this

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,540
room

393
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,639
and so I'm going to take a little risk

394
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,800
here and share a story

395
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,360
um

396
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,579
we were as a number of years ago I'm

397
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,380
talking to our CEO and I said we've got

398
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,360
a problem with kind of Shadow I.T people

399
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,579
going on buying tools and software that

400
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,019
we can't maintain

401
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,760
and he says well why why does that

402
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,800
matter so because they bring it in and

403
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,500
now there's a whole other Vector attack

404
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,120
from a security perspective there's

405
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
other issues too but from a security

406
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
perspective here's an attack Vector that

407
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,959
I don't even know about right so how am

408
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,880
I going to be able to takes me longer to

409
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
remedy whatever situation might occur

410
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
and he says well give me an example he

411
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
said well the marketing department just

412
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,579
got a new project management software he

413
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,100
says I'll talk to them about it

414
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,660
so he's talking to the marketing

415
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,160
director and uh

416
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,759
and she says oh we don't do that what do

417
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,899
you what do you mean we don't do Shadow

418
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,519
I.T he says well did you get a new

419
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,800
project management software she said oh

420
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,420
yeah we did

421
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,520
oh yeah I guess that is

422
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
Shadow I.T the thing that clicked for me

423
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,660
is

424
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,819
she didn't even realize what she was

425
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,599
doing

426
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,240
it was so easy

427
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,099
for her and her team to say hey we need

428
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,599
project management

429
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,640
we need and I can go get it for five

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,319
dollars a month

431
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,939
I'm just gonna do that and put it on my

432
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,140
card and I'm off and running right as an

433
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,240
I.T organization those things

434
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,240
they needed that we were not prepared to

435
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,260
offer it

436
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,640
right

437
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,039
and so we either have to from a

438
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,020
flexibility perspective we need to be

439
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,480
prepared to offer the tools that they

440
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,740
need

441
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,460
or we need to have in place methods for

442
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,260
them to get those tools and to let us

443
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,539
know so that we can then secure them and

444
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,179
put them into the

445
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,539
the fold if you will of the tools and

446
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,740
the security posture that we're

447
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,020
preparing for

448
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,700
um

449
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,120
so similar questions uh how confident am

450
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
I that my it team can rapidly respond to

451
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,700
the changing needs of my team

452
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,559
how confident am I that my system is

453
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,600
flexible enough to accommodate new tools

454
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,260
new systems and new data sources

455
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,000
and then ask your team the same thing

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,559
right

457
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,880
how confident are you that we can

458
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,440
accommodate Next Generation Business

459
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
Systems and tools that our teams need to

460
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,360
remain competitive

461
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
that's what they're doing as upset as I

462
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,660
want to be with the marketing team

463
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,660
they're doing what they need to do

464
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,360
to be the best at what they do

465
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
and that's what's changed between now

466
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,980
and 10 or 15 years ago when the IT

467
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,260
department and the IT leaders could say

468
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,059
you've got to do it my way or we can't

469
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,500
get it done

470
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,740
that has changed and we're saying we are

471
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,539
going to provide what you need so you

472
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,700
can get your job the best way possible

473
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,160
so we can grow our business

474
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,200
so that we can be the best that we can

475
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,380
be

476
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,460
and then at the end extensibility

477
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,960
this is one of those big words that we

478
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,840
put in here because everyone's using it

479
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,940
it really and because it works into our

480
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,140
acronym

481
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,200
this is about scalability right this is

482
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,280
about being able to grow quickly

483
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,140
uh to me one of the best examples of

484
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,140
this is if you are part of a company

485
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,080
whose growth strategy is around mergers

486
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,640
and acquisitions

487
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
right

488
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,919
you could overnight double the size of

489
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,120
your business

490
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,980
if you go merge a company about the same

491
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,480
size as yours

492
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,220
so why is that important especially from

493
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,080
a security perspective that you're

494
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
prepared for this

495
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,320
right

496
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,679
rapid growth requires new technologies

497
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,620
new tools tools you've never even heard

498
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,000
of because you acquired somebody that

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,039
was who knows what they were doing right

500
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,700
on their I.T in their I.T Department

501
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,580
the reality is is over time if we don't

502
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,740
have a plan for scalability and

503
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,140
extensibility we end up with a patchwork

504
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,600
of tools they don't work together it

505
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,140
becomes really difficult to manage the

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,559
security right if you've got 10 tools or

507
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,900
a hundred obviously 100 is going to be

508
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,640
harder to manage

509
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,120
and so having a plan around

510
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,860
scalability is important as you whether

511
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,539
it's from mergers whether it's just

512
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,880
you're a startup and and your growth is

513
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
exponential right

514
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,559
if you're not prepared for that type of

515
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,320
growth you end up having lots of holes

516
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
right you're just plugging these things

517
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
in uh and you'd hate to have to fix all

518
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,880
of that because of a breach right having

519
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,620
that security plan and saying you know

520
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,660
what we're going to put in place

521
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,840
internal tools processes so that we can

522
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
be prepared for that growth and that's

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,820
what extensibility uh

524
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,539
is about

525
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,380
same questions or similar right

526
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,080
is my system extensible enough to

527
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,700
accommodate new tools

528
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,220
uh how confident are we that we can keep

529
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,039
up with the growth in our company

530
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,360
right

531
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,120
there are not too many companies that

532
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,380
don't want to grow

533
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,520
right

534
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
if you're a public company it's the only

535
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,960
thing that matters

536
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,220
um but that growth is coming and we need

537
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,360
to be prepared for it

538
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,559
so safe

539
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,240
uh

540
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,059
and now we're going to move on to Pace

541
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,559
policy audit compliance and education

542
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,080
how many of you have

543
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,158
documented security policy

544
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,360
most half maybe

545
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,580
that's where we're going to start I was

546
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,980
having our VP of cyber security review

547
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,419
this I wanted to make sure I wasn't

548
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,880
telling you stories that aren't true

549
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,299
and one of his notes as he was reading

550
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,240
through this on this section was well

551
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,299
you can't have a policy without auditing

552
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,620
lucky for me audits the second one right

553
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,919
um and and that really is know that you

554
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,620
can't you can do these in order priority

555
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,140
but you cannot stop

556
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,080
if you stop at just having a policy it

557
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,580
will

558
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,320
ultimately fail

559
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,340
right

560
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,200
and so let's talk about

561
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,720
uh policy

562
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,620
um

563
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,720
we had a customer

564
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,280
and this is a story maybe a little about

565
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,780
policy

566
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,240
well we had a customer and they had a

567
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,100
patching policy

568
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,500
and their patching policy was we will

569
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,460
patch

570
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,860
every 270 days

571
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,340
I think that's plenty right

572
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,960
one of the things with policy that you

573
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,000
want to make sure you do you need to

574
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,700
have it reviewed both internally

575
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,880
and externally get some separate set of

576
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,020
eyes on it

577
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,340
because

578
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,720
270 days is not enough right and sure

579
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,179
enough they ended up having a breach

580
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,120
because of uh

581
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,159
of vulnerability in one of their systems

582
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,860
that was that had gone unpatched right

583
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,720
so

584
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
it's an example of having a policy and

585
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
then not having it

586
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,840
up to speed not reviewing it often

587
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,120
enough and not making sure that it meets

588
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,640
the requirements uh whether those are

589
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
many of you may be regulated regulated

590
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,940
in some uh form or fashion whether it's

591
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,880
government or Finance uh

592
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,419
PCI right lots of areas that have

593
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,260
certain policy requirements right those

594
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,659
of you who may not be regulated it's

595
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,280
really hard to get

596
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,059
to a point of good security

597
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,919
without having

598
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,620
some level of of policy

599
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,039
right

600
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,379
um

601
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,299
these are some of the questions that are

602
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,340
most important who's responsible for

603
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,460
keeping the policy updated

604
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,679
and I love this next one are are they

605
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,659
the right person for this role

606
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,360
right and if you go to the other one

607
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,860
this is one that I imagine would happen

608
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,140
at our organization not at ours some

609
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,940
other organization I'm sure

610
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,039
I think that it's supposed to be one

611
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,780
person and then when I ask that person

612
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,460
they think it should be someone else

613
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,080
right

614
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,440
this is clearly not going to be ideal

615
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,380
for keeping our policy updated if we're

616
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,840
not clear on where we need to be you

617
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,460
know when was the last time we reviewed

618
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,840
the policy

619
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,360
does the policy include how often it

620
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,740
should be reviewed

621
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,080
all right when was the last time we had

622
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
our policy reviewed by a third party

623
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
right and this clarification with

624
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,580
expertise and security policy

625
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,100
our marketing director is awesome

626
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,840
probably not the right person to review

627
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,820
your security policy

628
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,679
I should not pick on her I'm going to be

629
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,900
in trouble

630
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,620
um

631
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,840
and then ask your team the same thing

632
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,260
right

633
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
audit

634
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
um

635
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,940
audits can be expensive and they're

636
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,520
typically not fun whether that's an IRS

637
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,039
audit or a security audit right

638
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,179
uh

639
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,880
the goal of an audit is to show us where

640
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,679
we are

641
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,179
lacking

642
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,220
where we're missing the boat on our

643
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,539
policy

644
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,760
right how are you auditing these tools

645
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,679
and you really want to do it in a way

646
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,760
that is

647
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,260
um

648
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,140
that is automated right

649
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,260
how do you know when somebody uh logs in

650
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,000
to

651
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
um

652
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,980
from the wireless or from wired

653
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,320
you know are they logging in from when

654
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,000
and where they're supposed to do they

655
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,039
have new devices right

656
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,320
uh I think

657
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,179
this probably doesn't happen a lot of

658
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,559
times but

659
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,679
your Executives go to a uh an event and

660
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,440
every they all get new iPads right they

661
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,659
bring them in they connect to the Wi-Fi

662
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,000
how are you making sure that those in

663
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,620
your auditing to make sure those new

664
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,960
devices are following the policies that

665
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,480
you've put in place for those devices

666
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,860
right

667
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,600
do you know that they have new devices

668
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,740
on the network

669
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,559
these are all come into into play in

670
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,480
terms of making sure that that policy

671
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,039
that you've put in place

672
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,620
is being audited that you know what's

673
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,179
happening on your in your environment

674
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,760
and on your devices and your users right

675
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,059
we haven't talked about users a lot

676
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,159
because I think it's

677
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,080
I mean they are the problem

678
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,059
let's be honest

679
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,480
right I mean we love them we support

680
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,100
them at the end of the day and we're

681
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,600
going to get to education here in a

682
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,740
second that's when we'll talk about our

683
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,960
users at the end of the day a lot of

684
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,419
this is in place because as human beings

685
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,860
we make mistakes

686
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,600
right and uh in fact I was down in in St

687
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,539
George this week meeting with um

688
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,059
a customer and they have a policy this

689
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:24,840
was

690
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,340
they do a uh kind of a phishing test

691
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,200
how many of you do uh kind of an email

692
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,020
phishing test on a regular basis right

693
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,940
does anybody do it more than once a

694
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,380
month

695
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,840
a couple of you yeah this company does

696
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,460
it twice a month

697
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,940
and if somebody uh kind of clicks the

698
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,400
link two times in a six month period

699
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
they get written up and have to meet

700
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,900
with I.T director and their boss and if

701
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,340
they do it a third time they have to

702
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,418
meet with the CEO

703
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,760
and basically they're saying if you

704
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,260
can't learn or you can't pay enough

705
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,679
attention you are becoming a risk to our

706
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,220
business one that we may not be prepared

707
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,360
to keep on board

708
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,960
hey good luck

709
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,940
question

710
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,340
I you know I think it could

711
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,919
um this if you met this gentleman I

712
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,360
don't think you would think that he's

713
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,779
about the kindest man I've ever met

714
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,380
um

715
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,720
I think that as as they talked about it

716
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,779
in the way that that uh I heard it is

717
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,340
kind of like wow that is really strict

718
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,260
the way he presented it was much more

719
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,000
hey we sit down with them we talk to

720
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,100
them we want to understand like were

721
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,919
they just not paying attention uh and so

722
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,919
I do think I do I did feel like uh the

723
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,020
way that they they had presented it was

724
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,659
a much Kinder than what I kind of and

725
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,340
for those of you didn't hear that he

726
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,779
said doesn't that create a Culture of

727
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,179
Fear right and the first one was what if

728
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,460
it is your CEO doesn't see if you

729
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,720
couldn't if you couldn't hear back there

730
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,700
but so I think it's it's a really good

731
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,580
point and I think for them it was about

732
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,460
their approach of that correction to

733
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,320
kind of balance out like

734
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,600
uh he didn't say you do it three times

735
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,580
and you're fired but I think it was very

736
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,820
clear like this is serious business you

737
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,640
know so a good point how you do that can

738
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,240
be critical

739
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,220
yeah he mentioned just about snow having

740
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,380
a presentation on Tuesday about creating

741
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,260
a culture of security and as you create

742
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,720
that culture it kind of shifts probably

743
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,240
from Fear I'm paraphrasing but kind of

744
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
shifts from Fear to kind of this this is

745
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,279
important rather than don't do this or

746
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,440
you're fired and and I certainly felt

747
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,700
that from him

748
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,320
um but it was the first time I'd heard

749
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,020
of kind of this pretty you know it's

750
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,340
serious you're going to meet with the

751
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,559
CEO if if you don't understand what's

752
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,380
what's going on here so great comments

753
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,340
thank you uh so

754
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,039
this is uh for for audit those are some

755
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,120
of the things so here's some of the

756
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,279
questions uh to ask yourself

757
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,320
um who's responsible for part policy and

758
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,080
implementation audits uh how do we audit

759
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,299
the implementation of our security

760
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,100
policy and what is our exposure if we

761
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,840
don't do this I think this refers a lot

762
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,020
to governmental regulations right most

763
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,380
of them uh require you to have a policy

764
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,720
and they will also require certain level

765
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,000
of auditing so where do you fit into

766
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,140
that right

767
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,059
and then asking your team really these

768
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,700
same questions uh with one additional

769
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,260
that says how much of it is audited

770
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,020
right it would be impossible to manually

771
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,419
audit everything that's going on right

772
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,159
so automating that and getting the

773
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,720
alerts that you need in order to know

774
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,299
hey we've got a new device on here we've

775
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,620
got a device that's just joined the

776
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,659
network that doesn't have the security

777
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,840
controls in place that we require how

778
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,480
are we going to address that

779
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,240
um and then compliance right this is

780
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,299
about making sure that um

781
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,000
our people are are complying one example

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,159
that we you know we have a policy that

783
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,899
you can't access our

784
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,959
um

785
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,520
our tools and our environment unless

786
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,919
you're in the United States we're a

787
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,799
local company you really don't nobody

788
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,260
from Europe is going to be logging in to

789
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,000
our systems right

790
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,159
causes some problems with some of our

791
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,720
people when they travel on and they're

792
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,480
on vacation and they now want to notify

793
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,500
us

794
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,840
and that they're on vacation and they

795
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,399
want to work

796
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,799
we usually let them but they have to

797
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,600
figure out a way to tell us I mean they

798
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,580
can't teams us because they can't log in

799
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,260
they can't email us because they can't

800
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,000
they can't log in

801
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,919
luckily we like them and for the most

802
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,059
part they have our cell phone numbers

803
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,399
but uh this is one of those areas where

804
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,600
forcing that compliance becomes

805
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,880
important right in one way or another

806
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,360
creating those parameters that say we're

807
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,919
going to make sure that our human beings

808
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,100
our users are complying and when they

809
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,679
don't we want to know about it

810
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,860
and that's a part of uh

811
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,559
creating that

812
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,720
kind of that full circle right policy

813
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,960
audit compliance and then some questions

814
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,220
around compliance here

815
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
um I think the same question who's

816
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,220
responsible for it

817
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,320
right if nobody's responsible nobody's

818
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,600
doing it

819
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,720
well you probably are

820
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,779
whether you want to be or not uh you are

821
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,640
probably the one in charge and whether

822
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
that makes the most sense or not I think

823
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,980
is is a really good conversation to be

824
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,760
having

825
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,380
uh what is the potential for

826
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,899
non-compliance how do we Monitor and

827
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,200
mediate that compliance right

828
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,860
um

829
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,500
as we talk about this one of the things

830
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,620
I haven't mentioned and around this is

831
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,799
is really around bad publicity right if

832
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,080
we're not prepared and we have a breach

833
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,419
and and we were compliant or we're doing

834
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,820
everything we're supposed to and you can

835
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,620
really mitigate the

836
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,899
the bad publicity and the and the

837
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,000
negative impact that that it might

838
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,460
happen in the public

839
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,640
space right in the public Arena where if

840
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
you're non-compliant I mean it it can be

841
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,820
career ending or business ending right

842
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
and so making sure that you understand

843
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,320
what is that what does that look like

844
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,120
you know what is what will happen if

845
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,240
we're not compliant uh with what we've

846
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,440
agreed to do

847
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,019
right

848
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,779
back to this policy of 270 days of

849
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,000
patching

850
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,159
at least they were compliant with their

851
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,100
policy even if their policy was bad

852
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,340
there is some strength in complying with

853
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,679
your policy even if it's not that good

854
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,980
right so make sure you have that as part

855
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,399
of what you're doing and then education

856
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,679
I'm sure that those of you you talked a

857
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,099
little bit about doing fishing uh

858
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,020
tests right doing annual or more often

859
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,280
uh

860
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,918
security training uh

861
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,418
I don't know how many of you know what

862
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,399
we do at Balcom we're a we're a cyber

863
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,760
security kind of uh

864
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,339
reseller so one of the things that that

865
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,399
we are getting all the time is people

866
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,500
are always trying to buy stuff from us

867
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,359
that are from

868
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,739
uh

869
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,000
that are princes in in Africa for

870
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,379
example right

871
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,440
uh and they have gotten I mean that was

872
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,320
20 years ago they have gotten very very

873
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,339
sophisticated and I'll bet that we have

874
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,000
um

875
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,400
at least a handful of emails every

876
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,020
single week that we send out and say

877
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,540
this is a fraudulent email do not

878
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,280
respond to this they do not want to buy

879
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,760
a hundred laptops we promise right and

880
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
the the reality is that for our sales

881
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,980
team

882
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,280
they're doing training every quarter

883
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,079
because we do not want them to get

884
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,420
complacent around looking for these

885
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,880
types of things

886
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,980
for many of the other people in our

887
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,780
organization we do it annually and

888
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,140
that's typically sufficient right and so

889
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,720
for your organizations I think this is

890
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,700
one of those areas where for a lot of

891
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,640
compliance requirements governmental Etc

892
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,099
you're required to do training once a

893
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,339
year for example right

894
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,200
that may not be enough

895
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,260
and and really asking yourself these

896
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,200
same questions of you know uh

897
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,540
how security conscious is your team

898
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,160
you know

899
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,619
are you checking on the security posture

900
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,260
of your vendors and your partners this

901
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,240
is something that's new for for us in

902
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,280
the last maybe two or three years the

903
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,119
number of uh Partners both customers and

904
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,940
vendor Partners who are sending us and

905
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,140
saying tell us about your security

906
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,400
policy

907
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,560
share it with us

908
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,020
can you show us that you are auditing

909
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,359
and complying with your own policy

910
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,920
because in order for us to do business

911
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,619
with you on an ongoing basis we need to

912
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,599
know that you're doing the things this

913
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,579
is not just the government right

914
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,560
it's our partners that are asking us the

915
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,839
same thing that's something to consider

916
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,599
are you doing that uh

917
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,880
what is your education in place and when

918
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,980
was it last updated that's an important

919
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,839
question too you don't want to you want

920
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,220
to make sure you're not

921
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,680
training things that are old

922
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,960
make sure you're updating it

923
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,599
we all here know how quickly things

924
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,900
change in in technology and cyber

925
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
security is probably fastest of all we

926
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,300
need to be updating our our training uh

927
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,760
curriculum if you want to call it uh so

928
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
that everybody's getting that updated

929
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,760
training

930
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,500
um and then what routines do we have in

931
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,420
place we touched on that a little bit

932
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,280
and then ask your team on a scale of one

933
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,740
to ten how security conscious is your

934
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,420
team right ask them how security

935
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,040
conscious do they think the employees

936
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,060
are or your customers your end users

937
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,400
how can you increase that number

938
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,200
you know just by one

939
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,579
just take it one step at a time one

940
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,260
person how can we be one percent more

941
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,000
security conscious

942
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,500
and if you can take that a little bit

943
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,880
better at a time you'll continually

944
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,400
improve uh what you're doing the thing

945
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,140
that I would add to this for those of

946
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,540
you in leadership positions as well make

947
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,820
sure that your team your your

948
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,740
administrators are also getting the

949
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,119
education they need obviously you're

950
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,160
here right I imagine a lot of your teams

951
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,140
are here this is so important for them

952
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,300
to see and understand what's out there

953
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,240
right and to be prepared for those types

954
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
of things so just a quick review

955
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,380
um

956
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,680
safe Pace secure accessible flexible and

957
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,000
extensible

958
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,560
policy audit compliance and education

959
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,240
again number one takeaway get this

960
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,500
assessment

961
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,599
right take a picture of this I think

962
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,160
we're sending I think these are all

963
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,599
available

964
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,599
um anyway but this is available right

965
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,859
now and you can download it as I was

966
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,119
talking to our marketing director I said

967
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,040
well let's just create a

968
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,119
um

969
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,160
let's create a form they can fill out I

970
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,619
promise we won't gather their data and

971
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,720
then I right thank you

972
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,940
and none of them will believe us even if

973
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,619
we're being honest about it and you

974
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,660
shouldn't I mean we think we're honest

975
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,619
but

976
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,119
I mean I'm talking to a group of

it has been

1002
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,859
um somewhat difficult it's easiest after

1003
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:06,780
they've had a breach that's when it's

1004
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,359
really easy unfortunately

1005
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,320
um right uh and one of the reasons that

1006
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,079
we that we did this presentation

1007
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,760
is for them

1008
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,619
right we want

1009
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,160
the executives to know that this is it's

1010
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,359
not a

1011
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,240
please be prepared don't wait for it to

1012
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,460
happen and

1013
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,200
um in my opinion it's a lot about

1014
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,680
education and uh I'm gonna call out

1015
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,480
Philip Philip you raise your hand right

1016
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,440
here this is our VP of cyber security

1017
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,140
he'll probably have some better input if

1018
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,240
you want to sync up with him about that

1019
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,220
the conversations that he's had he's

1020
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,320
having those direct conversations with

1021
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,359
the executives of our customers and I

1022
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,099
know that he has them

1023
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,260
before they have a breach and I think he

1024
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,780
can talk very specifically about

1025
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,760
um how we're getting that that message

1026
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
across uh he's way better at it than I

1027
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,780
am

1028
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,680
um

1029
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,420
I don't know why I'm I'm doing the

1030
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,160
presentation

1031
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,839
he probably should have done it but

1032
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,599
actually par part of that is that

1033
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,480
um I can kind of sell Valcom and I can

1034
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,760
talk about some of these things Philip

1035
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,980
is really good about just understanding

1036
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,400
what our customers are are needing and

1037
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,020
how we can

1038
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,180
how we can help them what they need to

1039
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,119
do next in their security journey and so

1040
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,099
I think that's where his his strengths

1041
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,960
really are so thank you great question

1042
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,359

1043
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,740

1044
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,119
