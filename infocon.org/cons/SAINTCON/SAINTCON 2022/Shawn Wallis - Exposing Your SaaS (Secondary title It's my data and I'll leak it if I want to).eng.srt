title I always like to give an

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,880
alternative title is It's my day and

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,180
um I'm also advisor to do a silent push

Bay area so

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,160
first time in at think on first time in

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
Utah so good morning everyone thanks for

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,559
having me

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,860
um disclaimer IP memes Etc so tackles I

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,120
really want to share something cool that

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,920
I kind of worked on I had a lot of

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,960
encouragement from some uh on my network

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
and Friends

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,559
so I'm going to walk through how I came

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:56,879
about this

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
really kind of discuss it really the

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,100
concept I do a lot of what I would call

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,019
Innovation type stuff where I take a

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,299
problem and I step back and say

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,460
okay I can solve this simple thing but

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,680
how can I solve the bigger thing and

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,960
then how can I automate it and how can I

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
do it proactively so be sharing a lot of

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
the results with that and encourage

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,619
other people to go down the same path

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,540
right I really want people to

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,759
collaborate and to kind of figure out

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
their own path of

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
how can I do cool stuff like this

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,580
so

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,439
kind of the background of this of how

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,720
this came about is uh in my previous

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
company

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,040
um someone one day sent me a link and

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,020
they were like hey check this out and I

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,400
went to the link and it was some

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,460
whiteboard site and I was like okay well

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,900
there's there's

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,119
some some sensitive stuff there that's

49
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,040
not really cool and they're like yeah

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,920
it's exposed to the internet right so I

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,479
sent it to my personal machine and tried

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,460
it and sure enough I could get in so I

53
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,399
was like huh that's interesting

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,619
um I don't know what to do with it you

55
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,119
know just thanks for sending it to me

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,219
but uh it's not something I really

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,200
wanted to chase down so a couple days

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
later he sent me a second link you know

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,860
and it was a little more sensitive stuff

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,660
and I was like okay now I'm seeing a

61
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,459
trend here and I did some research on

62
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,860
the site and found even more stuff and I

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,060
was like okay

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,819
cool and then yeah and not only a week

65
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,040
later somebody sent me another one and

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
this one was interesting to me

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,739
this was our CEO having a basically in

68
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,080
all hands with all his staff

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,300
and there were three kind of important

70
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,760
things as it was who's who in the

71
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,099
company was important what their agenda

72
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,080
was and their contact including their

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,819
email and their their phone numbers and

74
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,400
I was like huh this is the perfect stuff

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,340
that any attacker would want of who the

76
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,319
leaders they should attack are and it's

77
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,540
all exposed to the internet if you know

78
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,620
the right link

79
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,540
so I was like okay now I got a couple

80
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,400
different sites

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
and you know I was like I don't know

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,239
really still didn't know what to do with

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,160
it so I sat on it for like a month and

84
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,019
then I had this this idea after looking

85
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,540
at the data

86
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,360
and what I came to is if I knew what

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
these sites were it would be easy to

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,800
find go search for you know uh Dropbox

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,720
go first search for Miro or something

90
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
right but I didn't know what our SAT

91
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,959
sites were we have a uh a casby but

92
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,239
it's not really helpful right as most

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,659
casings aren't and there's just so many

94
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,099
potentials out here I didn't know what

95
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,840
to look at so

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,019
I wanted to know how can I look at what

97
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,659
what site should I be looking for

98
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,400
and then figure out well if they're

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,260
sharing data how can I figure that out

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,959
versus manually having to go and go to

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,220
all these sites

102
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,019
and can I do it proactively and can I

103
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,879
automate it so

104
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,980
that's what I put together

105
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,920
so um the whole can be discussion right

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,680
I had all I talked to a lot of vendors

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
about this about the problem I was

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,840
trying to solve and they all came to me

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,760
and said well casby is trying to solve

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,580
basically our back access issues of hey

111
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,580
I want to control what somebody had this

112
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,080
site can get to what they can get to

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
here right and give you logs and access

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,079
of that and I'm like no I I care about

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,579
the deed of what's going there I'm like

116
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,738
oh well if you do data classification we

117
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,418
can figure that out I'm like well if

118
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,280
it's a whiteboard site or something how

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
are you going to classify that data it's

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,500
not a file it's pictures it's images

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,639
it's text right so finally you know I

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,139
ran into a couple that said you know

123
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,699
what the problem we don't have a

124
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,900
solution the problem you're trying to

125
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
solve is kind of a Next Level problem

126
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,520
uh and then they started to discuss

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
things like

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,560
Nixon casby Academy 2.0 so a lot of the

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
companies I talked to were interested in

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,280
what I was doing because I was solving a

131
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
problem they hadn't thought about

132
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,940
so

133
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,560
now

134
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,900
I do want to say the main thing on this

135
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,240
is it requires SSL encryption right A

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,580
lot of people still groan about that

137
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,560
because they're not able to do that or

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,320
are not doing that so I just want to

139
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,699
call that up front but the rest is

140
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,440
pretty pretty open

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,500
Sim have your proxy logs right

142
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
just be have a creative mind and

143
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,639
thinking about how to attack this and

144
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,139
then a little bit of patience you know

145
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,340
and I mentioned that hey if you're using

146
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,419
this book it's going to be a lot of

147
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,639
patience unless you have a big data

148
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,520
solution it's much better but trying to

149
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,580
pull that volume with Splunk clogs uh

150
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,139
definitely in the size and environments

151
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,000
I was doing was problematic and I had to

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,479
do very small Windows

153
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,100
luckily we did have a big data solution

154
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
that really sped things up for me

155
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,680
so now getting into the concept so

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
looking at all these sites right the

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,900
interesting thing that that came out to

158
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,820
me and was this I mean you know

159
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,320
the thing was

160
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
these all have the same patterns here of

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,759
what the URLs look like

162
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,220
but the last part is where the data is

163
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
so you can start to say oh

164
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm starting to see this pattern and I'm

165
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,360
starting to see the URL structures are

166
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,600
the same except for that last bit now

167
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,340
how many sites are you you know you

168
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,440
normally go to that have a directory

169
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
stretcher that are the same as you move

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
through that tree that directory

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,800
structure changes but if you're hitting

172
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
different data elements

173
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,360
then you are now clued in that there's

174
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,620
different data on these sites right

175
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,000
so

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
we kind of broke this down and said okay

177
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,780
how am I doing now I have my directory

178
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,960
we call this or for what purpose we just

179
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,280
called it the stem there are many other

180
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,139
names that you could call this

181
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,639
but it was important to bring this up

182
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,460
because now I could kind of look at this

183
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,660
pattern

184
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,300
and start to say well show me things

185
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,639
that have the same everything minus

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,900
system

187
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,560
and let's do some counts on that

188
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,539
so when we start looking at the data and

189
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,100
I'll get into some of the results in the

190
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,720
next slide to kind of show that show how

191
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,919
this works but you really want to say if

192
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm looking at like Dropbox or something

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
how many different of those stems are

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,720
unique right and now you start to get

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,940
unique elements that rise to the top and

196
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,280
you can say well these are sites that

197
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
have a lot of data elements right which

198
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,680
start to say these may be satisites that

199
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,539
I didn't know about or even maybe

200
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,979
they're not even a SAT site maybe

201
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,080
they're um you'll see a couple in the

202
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,419
results which are entertaining right to

203
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,400
look at

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,960
um initially that data will be very

205
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,880
overwhelming you'll start to get some

206
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,919
Google results right a lot of cash

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
results CDN stuff so you have to kind of

208
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,819
narrow your focus down

209
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,120
how I did that I eliminated the search

210
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
engines I looked at the error messages

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,539
right status codes anything a 404 I just

212
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,060
eliminated session size can be a good

213
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,759
tell right anything with data is going

214
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,580
to be above a certain size

215
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,300
um

216
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,160
the problem with this is if you're doing

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,780
if you're using Splunk and you're doing

218
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,599
this at a large scale of data this is

219
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,520
just making your Splunk query more

220
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,440
complex so I ended up having to do a lot

221
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,060
of this either through post-processing

222
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,180
or on a big data solution to speed it up

223
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,280
or or Splunk just kind of fell to the

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,299
knees so

225
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,039
so kind of looking at the results here

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
this is kind of what it starts to look

227
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,780
like so you start now to see that these

228
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,539
are your directories as I called it with

229
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,360
your unique stems right so you see like

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
for instance I didn't even know we use

231
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,679
figma right nobody actually did that I

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,919
talked to so seeing that and seeing all

233
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,559
of these links we were now able to go

234
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,660
and check these data things out and see

235
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,700
how they are so they and other companies

236
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,820
is it sensitive can anybody access it

237
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,220
etc etc

238
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,080
now there are you can see in here there

239
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,540
are some interesting false positives per

240
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,720
se like Etsy right is giving the same

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,700
thing and you start to go to Etsy and

242
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,620
you see what people are shopping for so

243
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,420
the cool thing about this is I found

244
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,600
some cool Christmas gifts right I you

245
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
know hey I I didn't know someone you

246
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,920
know Etsy had so much cool stuff so

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,500
being able to see that uh

248
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,880
but

249
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,720
going through here right now I have now

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,779
I know that figma has 308 unique data

251
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,940
elements and it's time to go and say

252
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,459
well what's in that data right so we can

253
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,140
talk about how it can kind of automate

254
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,300
that

255
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
um this is kind of more of an example of

256
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,200
what that data looks like right I just

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
blurred this out to make it easier but

258
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,620
you can kind of definitely see they're

259
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,420
all unique elements in here and you can

260
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,120
start to kind of just

261
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,620
usually I kind of spot check this myself

262
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,660
just hitting a couple seeing hey did

263
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,740
this work or not right

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
but then we get to the fun part where we

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,180
actually can go test the data so now

266
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,339
that I have all of this data you know I

267
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,680
can go pull this I put some benign stuff

268
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,720
up here but I definitely in my my

269
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,820
testing I've found

270
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
um some some more interesting things

271
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,440
right uh for instance

272
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,839
some of the companies

273
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,000
that we've been working with people will

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,220
share data to us so it's not necessarily

275
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,260
our data but it's still people putting

276
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,019
their data out there and I've definitely

277
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,640
found W2s and 999s Etc tax returns that

278
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,500
people put out there and then share with

279
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,980
you saying hey here come get my data for

280
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,500
whatever purpose right and I'm kind of

281
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,420
looking at that like yeah somebody

282
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,519
should tell them right good practices

283
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,160
and things like that

284
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,600
so

285
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
I recommend dumping this and doing this

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
from an external machine and the main

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,500
reason for that is a lot of these sites

288
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,640
can

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
whitelist IP address space and say you

290
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,060
know what don't don't require

291
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,279
authentication or don't you know prompt

292
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,200
for Access if it's coming from this IP

293
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,420
range so when doing this from an

294
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,040
external box you are getting a true

295
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
positive of

296
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,899
can I access this data right

297
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,700
um you may be doing SSO behind the

298
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
scenes you may not see that right

299
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,560
also there could be some rate limiting

300
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
in place one way or the other and you

301
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,060
just need to be cognizant of that

302
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,899
um

303
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,519
it's interesting the sites that don't

304
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,620
have rate limiting I can talk a little

305
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,399
bit more about a particular one I think

306
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,120
so it's pretty simple right just

307
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
initially how I did this was just a

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,420
Corolla right he said just took all that

309
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,820
data and said dude just go hit every URL

310
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,579
and um let's let's just go by the error

311
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,060
messages right uh you will start to see

312
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,459
some of them will prompt you for login

313
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,380
and stuff and you can filter that out in

314
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,720
your curl response data as well

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,000
but it's it's as simple as this right

316
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
it's just hitting the data see what you

317
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,019
can respond to and then figuring out can

318
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,579
I get to that data or not is it

319
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,260
sensitive or not

320
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,600
um back on some of the data it's

321
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,279
it's really interesting is when I was

322
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,079
looking through here I saw all sorts of

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,540
data right this was a job posting this

324
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,180
was all the SAT answers which I'm not

325
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,600
even sure if that's okay to be honest

326
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,339
like I don't know if that's the study

327
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,019
guide or

328
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,779
um or not but like I would see menus

329
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,660
from company you know from restaurants I

330
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,640
would see coloring pages you know mixed

331
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,160
in with a sensitive data so this kind of

332
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
goes longer term to what I was trying to

333
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,560
do is like okay this is great but what

334
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,899
if I could do something with like some

335
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,240
machine learning of parsing that data

336
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
out looking for keywords or looking for

337
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,740
things that started to say these are the

338
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,300
things I hear about these are the things

339
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,339
that would be sensitive this would be

340
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,079
not so that was kind of the the area

341
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,600
where I was taking this

342
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,820
um for more of that automation because I

343
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,740
didn't want to have to go review every

344
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,720
one of these images as entertaining as

345
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,420
it was believe me right

346
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,100
um seeing what what people are are

347
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,260
storing out there but at the end of the

348
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,820
day

349
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,200
um you know I had other things I wanted

350
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,519
to get to work on so

351
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,579
um this is really it so uh

352
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,380
you know the science Marketplace is

353
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,079
expanding so many companies are just

354
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,060
coming up overnight right and and

355
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,820
bringing new things up and they're not

356
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,459
thinking about security so

357
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,100
you know we were onboarding so so many

358
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,260
sites so being able to kind of see this

359
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,000
and see the data and see these patterns

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
of like whoa hey I've never seen the

361
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,779
site before what's going on here and

362
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,339
then reaching out even to our teams oh

363
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,740
yeah we're doing a POC forgot security

364
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,040
right it's like great so uh this became

365
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
a good identifying thing of when we

366
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,420
could proactively make sure that the

367
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,300
right controls were in place

368
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,980
um but the industry needs more solutions

369
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,720
like this you know what sites are being

370
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,639
used and what data is being shared there

371
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,279
and not from a data classification but

372
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,620
being able to really understand things

373
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,260
that are not file based and whatnot

374
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,480
are we supposed to be doing that yes or

375
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,820
no right so

376
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,920
uh this is really kind of a cool cool

377
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,660
thing to do with thread hunting I really

378
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,639
recommend that

379
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,600
um

380
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,240
again kind of taking through the process

381
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,820
here a lot of this was more about

382
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,160
Innovation and thinking about an idea of

383
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,540
saying well I have this particular

384
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,339
problem yeah I could have just looked at

385
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,260
the one site and then all the

386
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,720
neighboring sites but taking a step back

387
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
and saying how can I

388
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,940
take a step back and see all the sites

389
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,440
and then not only that how can I

390
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,940
automate that how can I make this

391
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,760
proactive how can I turn this into a

392
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,920
part of somebody's job whether it's

393
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
thread hunting or in their sock or

394
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,760
something now where they're checking for

395
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,639
this or even your DLP team right in

396
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,639
doing that so that's really what I kind

397
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
of enjoy through this whole process is

398
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,519
I took something right and I had a lot

399
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,980
of support behind it as well I was kind

400
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,079
of questionable like hey how exciting

401
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,180
was this and I had a lot of my network

402
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,800
um so we'll call out thanks to a lot of

403
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
them who were able to show support and

404
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,720
such so

405
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,060
I know that was a quick presentation but

406
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,040
uh we have time for questions if anyone

407
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,720
has any oh thanks

408
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,040
see you there barely

409
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah yeah that's a great question and if

410
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,000
anyone didn't hear although you were

411
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,740
very loud so thank you

412
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,199
um what did I automate right uh and

413
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,699
really there were I think essentially

414
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,740
three phases of that of the Automation

415
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,779
and the first automation was collecting

416
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,079
of the data right so I wrote API things

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,360
to pull down the logs from Splunk or a

418
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,820
big data solution to get those logs in

419
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,279
place right of understanding what are

420
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,079
those unique data elements and what

421
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,180
should those sites be that I'm pulling

422
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,540
once I had that data then pass it off to

423
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,420
a system that went and retrieve that

424
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,519
data

425
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,079
and in some cases we actually did

426
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,839
samples of the data because we started

427
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,820
to find some sites that looked like they

428
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,860
would hold data but they were more like

429
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,199
a Salesforce or a ticketing system where

430
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,019
uh right that it was always going to be

431
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,120
protected data so

432
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,620
um either we did that from a manual

433
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,779
perspective or we did that from a

434
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,579
sampling perspective because of the

435
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:27,360
scale

436
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,399
and then the third part is once we had

437
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,800
all the the response to that data

438
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,139
we started to automate through

439
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,240
that kind of machine learning part of

440
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,100
can we figure out

441
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,040
is this sensitive is this not is this a

442
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,279
menu is this a 1099 or W-2 right is

443
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,620
there socials here is there you know

444
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,980
number numbers of data here right and

445
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,540
how we were doing that was partly

446
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,459
through AI or partly more machine

447
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,079
learning where we just vetted a ton of

448
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,699
sensitive data and tried to build a

449
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,040
model that knew the difference between

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
the two

451
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,560
I hope that helps

452
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,559
any other questions

453
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,079
all righty well thanks for having me

454
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,430
again I appreciate it

455
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:21,569
[Applause]
