28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,740
another con she's got a collection of

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,860
these things now uh she also did

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
something very cool with me this year

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,040
where glennons for punishment so if

32

that's that's our baby that's something

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,720
uh quite Behemoth this year however uh

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,520
We've also this year started the social

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
engine engineering community at Defcon

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,820
this year that was that was something I

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,079
don't know what we're gonna do to top

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,119
ourselves next year but she is the

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,979
global head of innovation and Delivery

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,220

improve their business but also leading

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,560
their social engineering engagements

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
that includes over 130 physical security

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,038
Assessments in her career without ending

48
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,739
up in handcuffs there's only been I

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,540
believe one that she's told me about

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,819
that had law enforcement involved big

51
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,379
Disney fan girl we're going to Disney

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
how do I how do I put this without

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
making you cry inspiration to see her

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,379
build this career and get to where she

56
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,720
is in 12 years

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,580
absolutely mind-blowing and I am excited

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,819
to hear what she's put together for your

59
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,819
keynote so without further Ado I will

60
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,220
pass the mic to snow go ahead and play

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,780
the soundtrack that she's got to queue

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,360
up as you take the stage

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,340
Soundtrack This is a surprise to me

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,710
a round of applause no okay

65
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,760
[Applause]

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
okay

67
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,019
there is no soundtrack right just making

68
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,940
sure I don't know if I'm waiting for

69
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,580
something okay

70
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,239
all right

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,840
the year is 2019.

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,180
and I just broke into a very famous

73
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,040
everyone here is probably part of it

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,159
building very secure all the bells and

75
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,879
whistles building

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,959
I was on cloud nine I didn't think I

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,940
could do it

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,480
and now I have to go present my findings

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,060
to the security team so I'm at their

80
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,959
office

81
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,260
in their headquarters in a board room

82
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,239
with a bunch of people and me

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,940
and my slide deck ready I have all the

84
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,860
ways I've broken suggestions for

85
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,080
mitigation all this stuff I'm ready

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
to start my slides

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,799
and I start talking

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,799
the CSO Cuts me off mid-sentence

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,819
and he says

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,799
very frustratedly

91
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,840
you have been doing this and you have

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
been successful doing this for the last

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,540
few years now

94
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,760
why are you always successful what are

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,040
we doing wrong right I didn't get

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,560
through the presentation he is just so

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,380
upset what are we doing wrong

98
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,440
so I went up to the Whiteboard

99
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,340
and I wrote this

100
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,259
if you do not know what this number is

101
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,660
you will by the end of this presentation

102
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,940
of this Keynote

103
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,979
but I will tell you exactly what I told

104
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,680
him at the end so keep this number in

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,720
mind as we move forward with this

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,100
presentation

107
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,800
all right so I am snow I'm so glad to be

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,380
here today and talk with you all in this

109
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,780
crazy Filled Room of people it's so

110
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,639
exciting to see how much Saint Han has

111
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,460
grown over the years so I have a

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,780
question for everyone and the question

113
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,940
is who here

114
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,100
is afraid of being a Target in the

115
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
social engineering attack show of hands

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,100
okay who's lying

117
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,139
right I'm afraid of being a Target in

118
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,240
the social engineering attack

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,540
right there's so many attacks that are

120
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,400
happening Non-Stop

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,100
and it's just insane so I want to take a

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,380
look at some of the data behind this

123
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,600
and how successful social engineering

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,940
has been in their industry I don't know

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,620
who here is a data nerd but that is 100

126
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,440
me so I like looking at the numbers I

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,699
can tell you stories and I'm going to

128
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,560
tell you stories Jason told you stories

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
deviant is full of stories as well of

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,699
how we've been successful but let's look

131
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,139
at some of the proof in our industry

132
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,180
41

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,940
of attacks started with fishing for the

134
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,440
initial access

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,300
that is huge I mean it's followed up by

136
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,400
like cloud misconfigurations and smaller

137
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,220
things like that but that is a huge

138
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,919
number phishing is still so relevant

139
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,320
this number isn't fluctuating it's

140
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
staying the same

141
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,240
all right so we know it's important it's

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,940
happening a lot how much does it cost an

143
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
organization if they get breached

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,020
sorry this side's a little bit small but

145
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,900
a lot of these things are social

146
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,759
engineering and this is measured in the

147
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,819
millions of dollars right so when we're

148
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,699
looking at fishing

149
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,740
4.91 million dollars is the average cost

150
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,900
it costs an organization when they have

151
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,280
to deal with a data breach when

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,560
fishing's involved

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,860
that's a lot of money that is a lot of

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,979
money okay so we know that it happens

155
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:49,199
often it's costing us a lot of money

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,960
oh but employees aren't really helping

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,880
they're not reporting it right only 15

158
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,460
of people report suspicious emails

159
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,060
that number is way way way way way too

160
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,080
low it's insanely low 15 of people are

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,699
just reporting it that means the other

162
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,380
ones are falling for it they're ignoring

163
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,880
it they're not doing anything with it

164
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,039
it's really really scary so I want you

165
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
to think about something for a second

166
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
okay I want you to take a minute to

167
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,940
think about how we are currently

168
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,759
mitigating social engineering attacks

169
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,259
right what are things that we're doing

170
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,599
security awareness training right

171
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,060
everyone here well not everyone here

172
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,639
should say a lot of require compliance

173
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
Frameworks require it so we're having to

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,639
do it uh raise your hand if you are not

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,139
doing security awareness training

176
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,580
I think I see one hand thank you for

177
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,259
your honesty

178
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,300
two hands

179
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
so everyone here is doing security

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,199
awareness training

181
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,160
but is it working

182
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,380
multi-factor Authentication

183
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,500
we will talk about this later right this

184
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,699
is one of the ways a lot of people

185
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,860
suggest mitigating

186
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,900
social engineering attacks

187
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,120
secure your email Gateway

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,280
how many folks have that set up right

189
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,539
there's a lot of companies that are

190
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,000
doing this now lots of them show of

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,740
hands how many organizations have

192
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,699
security

193
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,160
okay are you guys just like lying to me

194
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,139
or does nobody seriously have this

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,080
we have things like web filters right so

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,700
people can actually reach malicious

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,599
websites we have things like physical

198
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,899
access controls so to hopefully stop

199
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,720
people from getting into our

200
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,220
organizations

201
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,160
and we even have things like voice

202
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,860
recognition software does anyone here

203
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,800
work at a call center by chance

204
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,260
no so a lot of call centers are starting

205
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,480
to adopt this which is really cool to

206
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,339
see unless you're an attacker like

207
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,500
myself then it sucks

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,080
um just a quick story here I was on an

209
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,339
engagement where I had a call call

210
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,700
center and within two minutes of me

211
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,320
being on the phone and talking to this

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
person uh this call rep they knew I

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,519
wasn't the person I was impersonating

214
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,140
because they had voice recognition

215
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,100
software

216
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,580
pretty crazy stuff how fast I can I can

217
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,399
uh pick up on that all right

218
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,480
so I want to go into story time I want

219
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,880
to tell you some of the stories where

220
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,100
I've been successful in ways that those

221
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,519
mitigation steps should have stopped me

222
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,640
now one of the things that I want you to

223
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,339
think about as I'm going through and

224
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,560
telling you these stories is think about

225
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,220
what Solutions or anything you have in

226
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,560
place in your organization that should

227
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,300
stop social engineering as I'm telling

228
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,740
these stories

229
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,060
so the first thing I want to talk about

230
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,160
in JC mentioned is the social

231
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,500
engineering community we're super

232
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,720
excited to do it uh this year at Defcon

233
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,060
was our first year we took over the

234
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,440
village and very very excited show of

235
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
hands who actually went to Defcon this

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,620
year

237
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,080
okay did anyone actually stop in the in

238
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,820
the village

239
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,519
are just a couple I highly recommend

240
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,380
going next year it is a lot of fun so

241
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,360
just kind of high level how the village

242
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,279
works is we have a bunch of different

243
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,560
events and a competition so for the

244
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,360
events we have a research we have a

245
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,120
youth event we have cold calls so people

246
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,100
just don't want to show up and make a

247
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,320
call they get in our soundproof booth

248
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,940
which I'll show a picture here in a

249
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,160
second and as soon as I get in the booth

250
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,899
they get their target and the goals that

251
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,100
they're supposed to get so it seems like

252
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,860
what kind of antivirus do they use

253
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,300
um really really interesting to listen

254
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,519
to those calls here's actually a picture

255
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,980
of the booth so this picture was from

256
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,500
our competition which is the fishing

257
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,899
competition how the competition works is

258
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,339
we have pre-selected uh contestants and

259
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,800
they're given a list of objectives now

260
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,740
those objectives range crazy from the

261
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,480
operating system they use to do they

262
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,640
have anti-tailgating signs up

263
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,980
and so the the competition Works in two

264
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,200
phases the first phase they show or

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,899
sorry is all remote so they have their

266
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,720
objectives and their target company and

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,399
then they get to go and do research can

268
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,680
they find those flags those objectives

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,260
online right and then they write it up

270
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,120
and they get points for it now the

271
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,040
exciting part is when they show up to

272
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
Defcon to our village and they sit in

273
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
the soundproof booth just like you can

274
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,260
see here in the picture she's kind of in

275
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,300
that corner and then on the projector

276
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,640
screens is uh the cameras of of this

277
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,399
contestant and then they Place Live

278
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
phone calls in front of this audience to

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,680
try to get those questions answered from

280
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,620
their target very terrifying I know from

281
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,720
experience it is not fun to try to

282
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,820
elicit things from people while having

283
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,860
an audience

284
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,019
um so one of the questions or the

285
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,300
objectives that we have is do they use

286
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,820
security awareness training and the

287
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,440
fault question is

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
what do they think about it

289
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,459
now the reason we had the objective it's

290
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,440
it's kind of for a couple reasons

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,420
and we want to kind of trip them up a

292
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,279
little bit we want to give the Target on

293
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,019
the phone a little bit of a win possibly

294
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,000
right if I tell you and I'm going to use

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
a JC analogy here if I tell you not to

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,800
think of a pink elephant what are you

297
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,120
going to do

298
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
you're going to think of the Pink

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,140
Elephant right so if we ask you oh are

300
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,820
you taking security awareness training

301
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,680
that's supposed to put it on the front

302
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,779
of their mind that's supposed to be what

303
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:37,980
they start thinking about they're

304
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,440
supposed to start thinking of red flags

305
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
however

306
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,279
that's not what happened

307
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,079
people were like oh yeah we take

308
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,880
security awareness training and they

309
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,560
would go on to describe it without even

310
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,019
being asked yeah we know if someone

311
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,060
calls and asks for my credit card

312
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,220
information or my username my password

313
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm supposed to hang up immediately that

314
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,500
is the bad guy that's a scammer

315
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,540
they're telling to this on to the phone

316
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,220
to the person who is getting information

317
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,440
from them they're not asking them for

318
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,180
credit card information

319
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,800
they're not asking them for their

320
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
username and password they're asking

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,760
them for things like do you badge into

322
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,639
your office

323
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,940
do you have Windows things that might

324
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,639
seem innocuous however if we have all

325
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,959
these little bits and pieces of

326
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,760
information that can help us with our

327
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,800
attack later on things that they should

328
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,320
not be giving anyone who's calling them

329
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,300
that's not verified yet

330
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,399
so it's a very interesting thing that we

331
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,980
were able to find actually one of the

332
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,680
calls the person went on to say Yeah we

333
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,720
actually keep a key under the lock

334
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,540
right terrifying things that you should

335
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,459
not be telling someone who's not

336
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,800
verified but they all said they took

337
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,420
security awareness training when they

338
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,700
were asked

339
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,040
they didn't see any red flags

340
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,200
they even went on to say yeah they

341
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,240
didn't see red flags because the caller

342
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,560
wasn't asking for credit card

343
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,779
information or a username and password

344
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,459
so what happened here

345
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,399
security awareness training failed

346
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,860
right they had just enough training

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,480
where they memorized those little bits

348
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
and pieces right they knew that a

349
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
password and a credit card information

350
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,260
was a red flag but they didn't realize

351
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,000
the other pieces

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,820
that should have been a flag right so an

353
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,260
issue here is security awareness

354
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,300
training as much as we preach people

355
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,880
need to take it it is not covering

356
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
everything that attackers are doing

357
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,760
in that hour when you talk about phone

358
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,199
calls and all you say is don't give

359
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,260
someone your password that's it that I

360
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,120
don't ask feed people for passwords on

361
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
fishing assessments never

362
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,139
I don't do that because I know it's

363
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,360
covered but there's so many other things

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,380
I do

365
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,940
so when you sit there and you look at

366
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,199
security awareness training you really

367
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,019
need to evaluate what it's covering for

368
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,760
our users what are they what are they

369
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
actually learning

370
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,060
all right so I have another story here

371
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,000
about fishing so

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the client was a Fortune 500 company

373
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,019
and they wanted to have us sample a uh

374
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,060
random selection of people in various

375
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,620
apartments right just get a good sample

376
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,199
so we did osint we found a couple

377
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,079
subdomains they used and when we viewed

378
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,699
those subdomains we found what the

379
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,399
portals looked like cool so we buy a

380
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,500
type of squatted domain so domain that

381
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
looked very similar to the one that they

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
were used to using for an example if a

383
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,920
company uses

384
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,440
vpn.company.com we'll buy something like

385
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,240
vpnd-company.com it's very easy to

386
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,240
oversee and it works very very well

387
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
get our fishing website set up it looks

388
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,779
exactly like the one that they're used

389
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,380
to seeing we send off our campaign

390
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,380
so in The Last Story security awareness

391
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,600
training it failed but this time it

392
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,500
worked

393
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,079
someone reported the fish which is great

394
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
right

395
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,779
however

396
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,760
the junior sock analyst who was

397
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,680
reviewing that report

398
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,920
said oh it has an SSL cert

399
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,860
oh it looks legit

400
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,560
and they removed it from quarantine

401
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,819
and they let it out

402
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,720
so while security awareness training

403
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,519
worked

404
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,740
we still had some other failures right

405
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,800
we didn't have a properly trained sock

406
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,560
analyst or we didn't have any IR

407
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,079
playbooks right we talk about security

408
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,940
awareness training for the everyday user

409
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,639
but what about training the people in

410
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,279
these security roles right what does

411
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,139
that actually look like when was the

412
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,880
last time you've evaluated what their

413
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,459
training was and even tested them on it

414
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,959
how about take a sample of the things

415
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,339
that they've reviewed to make sure it's

416
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,440
correct

417
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
we're not doing that

418
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
let's talk about playbooks if you don't

419
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,680
have them get them if you do have them

420
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,660
test them how do you know something

421
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,480
works if you don't test it

422
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,640
you can have all the documentation in

423
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,619
the world but without going through the

424
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,240
steps to make sure it works it's still

425
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,880
it's pointless

426
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,740
all right another fishing story I love

427
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,939
fishing

428
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,540
okay so this one kick begins with the

429
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,880
kickoff call so we're talking to the CSO

430
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,559
we're asking what are your goals for

431
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,780
this test right what do you want us to

432
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,679
do

433
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,720
and he said well

434
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,360
we feel pretty secure right we have MFA

435
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,640
we have

436
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,700
password managers I don't I don't really

437
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,440
think we have a big risk when it comes

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,919
to fishing

439
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,780
okay so challenge accepted

440
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,640
um so the goals that we decided were is

441
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
one to see if we can get a set of

442
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,480
credentials and then try to reuse them

443
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,340
on a different portal that they had a

444
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,380
different type of service they had

445
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,760
so being the

446
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,320
challenge

447
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,600
uh excited people that me and my team

448
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,820
are we wanted to see what we can do

449
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,700
so we dug into osin and we decided okay

450
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,380
let's first go for their accounts with

451
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,260
MFA we have a framework we can use to

452
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,539
capture those credentials and the token

453
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,940
and get access right he thinks that's

454
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,580
foolproof let's see what we can do

455
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,820
and then let's have a backup list of

456
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,500
websites and portals that their

457
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,240
employees log into to see if we can

458
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,580
reuse those passwords

459
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,340
so we did our research we did tons of

460
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,400
osent on LinkedIn we found an employee

461
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,860
who talked about just setting up MFA on

462
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,500
their Office 365 and so like a perfect

463
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,520
Office 365 fish let's go and so what we

464
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,320
did is we sent out that fish and before

465
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,880
we sent it out we had a list of other

466
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
services we were going to try to plug

467
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,840
any credentials in again he was very

468
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,880
confident we were somewhat nervous but

469
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,700
really excited to try it and it took

470
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,559
about eight hours before that MFA fish

471
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,760
worked

472
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,980
right we used a service called uh evil

473
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,919
Jinx or evil nginx which if you haven't

474
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,500
heard of please go look it up especially

475
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,020
if you think that you are safe from

476
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,140
fishing because of because of MFA

477
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,120
so what happened was the employee logged

478
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,900
in

479
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
then they were prompted for their TFA

480
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,400
code they got they supplied it and then

481
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,500
we were in we were able to capture that

482
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,620
session and then use it and we still had

483
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,660
their credentials so we took those

484
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,580
credentials and we plugged them into a

485
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,020
list of different services that they had

486
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,299
I think on the fourth one we were able

487
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,620
to get in

488
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,360
again he said we weren't going to be

489
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,020
able to get in because of MFA and

490
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,240
because of them having a password

491
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
manager so we had a wrap-up call and

492
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
we're explaining everything that

493
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,660
happened he's like I don't get it

494
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,500
like this should have worked right we

495
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,840
explained how the MFA attacked work he's

496
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,700
like okay I get it but the password

497
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,100
manager thing is still driving me nuts

498
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,620
we gave all of our employees password

499
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,799
manager access a couple months ago

500
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,299
but someone's still reusing their

501
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,160
credentials like I don't get it and we

502
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,840
asked well what kind of education did

503
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,940
you give around password managers

504
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,059
he's like well none

505
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,160
so what happened was this employee is

506
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,140
using past manager but they had the same

507
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,660
password and for every single login that

508
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,840
they had

509
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,059
without them knowing and that's not

510
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,580
their fault we cannot blame our user for

511
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,740
that right for us it's like oh well

512
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,539
that's stupid like it's easy to think

513
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,700
that but no it's not they had no idea

514
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,380
they thought was the place where they're

515
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,400
supposed to put their username and

516
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,020
password they did exactly what they were

517
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,580
told

518
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,160
exactly what they were told we didn't

519
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,539
make it clear

520
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,100
that organization didn't make it clear

521
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,160
they didn't provide any training on how

522
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,340
to actually use a password manager

523
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,559
they just assumed so what went wrong

524
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,340
here

525
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,620
right lack of specific training they

526
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,840
launched a new tool a new product and

527
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
they didn't train anyone on it

528
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
they didn't have any policies around it

529
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,059
and then the misunderstanding of MFA so

530
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,059
let's talk about MFA for a second

531
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,520
MFA is great for what it was originally

532
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,020
intended for

533
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,179
which is stopping attacks where the

534
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,880
attacker tries to reuse your username

535
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620
and password right your those compromise

536
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,360
credentials but they don't have a

537
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
channel to the victim

538
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,020
so they're able to compromise find your

539
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,880
credentials on the dark web data

540
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,740
breaches wherever they have those and

541
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,240
they plug them in somewhere and then

542
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,340
they get that prompt for two-factor code

543
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,260
if they don't have a channel to the

544
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,580
victim

545
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,000
then it stops it it's great however

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,860
when we as an attacker are able to

547
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,559
control that channel right I send out

548
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,080
the phishing campaign I controlling it

549
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,520
and then I'm also controlling that

550
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,200
prompt for the two Factor

551
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,559
it doesn't work it's broken

552
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,240
that's something we have to look in the

553
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
mirror

554
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,520
and face we say MFA is is the Saving

555
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,539
Grace

556
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,720
but it's not I'm not saying don't use it

557
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,220
I'm just saying you have to really think

558
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,380
about how it works before we recommend

559
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,780
it as a tool that's going to save

560
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,799
everything

561
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,380
all right let's talk about fishing or

562
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,940
voice phishing

563
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,640
so this campaign the goal was to elicit

564
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,100
sensitive information from our Target it

565
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,659
might say sensitive information I mean

566
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,659
the type of browser they use they're the

567
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,100
version of the browser right we want to

568
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,360
see if anything's out of date what type

569
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,460
of antivirus they use because what we

570
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,380
were doing on this campaign is we're

571
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,059
taking all the information and then we

572
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,860
were feeding it to the red team so they

573
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,320
can build customized payloads and and do

574
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,880
further testing from there A lot of

575
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,919
times we work with other groups like

576
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,960
that and social engineering is a perfect

577
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,260
way to get information from people so

578
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,840
we call our employee we go through our

579
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,820
regular spill okay I'm calling for my

580
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,980
tea we're doing up XYZ and the

581
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,700
employee's like oh wait

582
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,179
I have to call you back to verify you

583
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,980
I'm confused

584
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,320
like okay so we give her a number

585
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
30 seconds later she calls back she's

586
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,240
like okay

587
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,380
to you

588
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,840
like yeah it's me

589
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,400
it's still me

590
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,620
and she still gives us all the all the

591
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,440
information

592
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,020
has anyone here heard of a

593
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,539
callback verification policy show of

594
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,919
hands

595
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,600
just a couple hands I'm surprised it's a

596
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,120
little bit more so how it works is if

597
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,980
someone calls you and you can't verify

598
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,539
who they are especially if they're

599
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,179
saying they're from I.T or asking for

600
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,860
sense of information how the policy is

601
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,539
supposed to work is you say okay let me

602
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,220
get your information

603
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,520
so I can verify you they hang up they

604
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,860
actually verify them right through their

605
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,360
manager through whatever channels they

606
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,520
have and then if it's legit they call

607
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,320
them back which I'm assuming most times

608
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,299
it's not legit

609
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,880
however this employee didn't understand

610
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,340
the policy she just thought that she had

611
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,080
to get the phone number of the person

612
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
calling and call them back

613
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,320
this is another example of broken

614
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,280
policies or policies that aren't tested

615
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,380
we can have all the policies that would

616
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,299
that would in an Ideal World make us

617
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,360
secure but if we're not testing them or

618
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400
seeing if our users actually understand

619
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
them what's the point it's just words on

620
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
paper

621
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,620
we also had security awareness uh

622
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,960
failure here as well right because we

623
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,400
weren't asking for a password we weren't

624
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
asking for that credit card information

625
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,659
she didn't see any red flags she thought

626
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,220
she was following her policy but she

627
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,400
still gave us tons of information

628
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,059
all right let's move on to a physical so

629
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,880
this physical took place in New York our

630
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,500
client had just leased a brand new

631
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,659
building and they want to test the

632
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,520
security right they had all the bells

633
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,440
and whistles they spent tons of money on

634
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,260
all these Access Control Systems they

635
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,299
used the building security guards they

636
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,280
bragged about them being undercover arm

637
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
guards which was kind of scary

638
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,860
um but we still tested it right and so

639
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,419
as we're going through and we're doing

640
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,520
our ocent before we even show up on site

641
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,380
right just like Jason talked about in

642
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,820
his talk earlier right he wants to find

643
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,200
the badges he wants to look at the floor

644
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,240
plans all these things well we also

645
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,140
found something on the property

646
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,000
management website

647
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,419
they had an application to fill out for

648
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,059
visitors to get a badge I mean like a

649
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,980
web application I mean like a form all

650
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,779
you had to do is print it

651
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,120
fill it out and they're supposed to give

652
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,559
you a guest badge

653
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,440
so I'm like okay let's test this

654
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,620
print it out fill it out show up to the

655
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,779
guard and in my mind I was thinking okay

656
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,000
in an ideal world he would have a point

657
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,380
of contact that he would need to call

658
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,539
down uh from the building they would

659
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,059
have to escort me all these steps but I

660
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,120
still had to try it not one question he

661
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,620
looked at the form

662
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,939
and gave me a dispatch

663
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,700
as I was walking around the building

664
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,940
on the client's site I was able to use

665
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,080
my RFID

666
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,419
credential stealing device so I had my

667
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,760
purse and you can't even see it and I

668
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,140
got close enough to a handful of

669
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,000
employees or is able to get their badge

670
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,760
credentials and I made a copy of my own

671
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,100
and I was able to use that same card

672
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,140
that I made a clone of for an entire

673
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,120
week getting in and out of the building

674
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,880
not being questioned once showed up

675
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,940
multiple times a day

676
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,580
let's talk about how some of these

677
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,559
things were broken

678
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,539
they didn't have an RFID pass back

679
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,340
policy has anyone ever heard of that

680
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,520
before

681
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,380
so let me explain what it is so when you

682
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,600
badge into a building the system says

683
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,820
okay cool Stephanie badgston

684
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,200
and that's it

685
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,360
now if I'm an attacker and I steal

686
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,299
Stephanie's credentials and I use it the

687
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,799
system just thinks oh Stephanie keeps

688
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,000
badging in

689
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,520
however if there's an anti-passback

690
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,740
policy there would actually have to be

691
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,539
something where the person would have to

692
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,779
badge out from the secure side so okay

693
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,760
Stephanie's inside oh Stephanie bad

694
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,799
shout so Stephanie can't be inside and

695
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,299
if that's the case and I have those

696
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,700
stolen credentials on a badge and I try

697
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
to badge in but the person's already in

698
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,419
it won't let me

699
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,580
it's little policies like that that go

700
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,440
such a long way there's so many times

701
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,320
they see clients that spend so much

702
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,260
money it's insane how much money and all

703
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,480
these products and services but they're

704
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,940
not configured properly or just a little

705
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,640
extra step that would have stopped me

706
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,820
from getting in the rest of the week

707
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,620
let's also talk about third party risk

708
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,820
management

709
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,880
we have like your landlords or or any

710
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,179
service providers there's sometimes risk

711
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,580
or there's risk when you're utilizing

712
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,520
someone else's stuff why are you not

713
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,179
testing it you're just trusting it

714
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,919
all right so so those are some stories

715
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,440
how I've been successful myself Jason

716
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,960
deviant we can probably spend the entire

717
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,299
week talking about these stories

718
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,640
but I've also seen stories I've had

719
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,159
experiences where I have been stopped

720
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:18,840
which has been

721
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,140
honestly a breath of fresh air

722
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,260
so not everything uh

723
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,240
or so this is a fishing story excuse me

724
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,059
so the goal of this campaign was to send

725
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,159
out an email to 100 people to see how

726
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,419
many people give us their username and

727
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:34,320
password

728
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,360
and so we send it out

729
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,120
and the way I send phishing campaigns I

730
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,059
send about a two to five second delay in

731
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,740
between every single email because

732
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,380
sometimes if you send out 100 at once uh

733
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,640
the the filters are gonna be like oh

734
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,020
this looks this looks sketchy we're

735
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,520
going to quarantine it which I don't

736
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,840
want so I have a delay in those emails

737
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,000
one of the very first people that

738
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,340
received it reported the fish

739
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,100
within five minutes the sock found it

740
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,020
they quarantined it they shut down the

741
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,720
entire campaign before all of the emails

742
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
even sent

743
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,419
I wasn't shocked that has never happened

744
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,740
to me before

745
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,980
so why was this successful and I asked

746
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,380
my client like okay like this is great

747
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,899
what's going on he's like well

748
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,559
we invest a lot into our security

749
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,299
he's like but we don't call it security

750
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,580
awareness training that's a word we do

751
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,740
not use that phrase at all

752
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,140
it is security awareness culture

753
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,340
we have built it from the top down it's

754
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,559
important to our leadership every time

755
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,840
the CEO gets on an all-hand calls once a

756
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,740
quarter

757
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,799
he brings up how important

758
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,260
security is so everyone hears it from

759
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,240
him

760
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,220
isn't that really cool to think about

761
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,440
it's a culture it's not just a training

762
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
that we dread once a year

763
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,360
it's a part of who they are

764
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,880
on top of that the the user right they

765
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,740
knew how to report that's something else

766
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,820
Jason talked about I thought was

767
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,860
fantastic we can spend all this time

768
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,360
educating people but if they see

769
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,679
something suspicious and they don't know

770
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,240
how to report they're not going to do it

771
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,539
this user know exactly how to report and

772
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,059
the sock was on their A-game

773
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,600
this was such a win I love it

774
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,340
all right I have another story

775
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,320
so this story comes from a call that I

776
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,919
witnessed years ago in the SC Village at

777
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,640
Defcon so how it worked was the caller

778
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,159
or sorry the the social engineer they're

779
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,240
calling their Target and they were going

780
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,919
through their Spiel right I'm this

781
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,360
person calling from this company I need

782
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,340
this information there were pretending

783
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,020
to be someone from I.T

784
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,539
and their target goes whoa

785
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,799
you didn't give me the code

786
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,700
what code

787
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,940
like once a week we get a code from it

788
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,799
that they say before they call and ask

789
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,279
us for information

790
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
that's kind of cool I've never seen that

791
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,020
before heard it it stopped the social

792
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,760
environmental tracks they didn't have

793
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,340
the code they didn't know what to say

794
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,740
it's all because the company that they

795
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,940
were calling

796
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,520
they took a chance on change they did

797
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,720
something outside of the box

798
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
this isn't something that I've ever

799
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,020
heard or seen before

800
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,360
yeah it worked

801
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,279
and it's something I really encourage

802
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,260
you all to think about is doing things

803
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,940
that are outside the box all right

804
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,860
enough about stories for a second let's

805
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,658
talk about numbers and do some math

806
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,520
wow you all look like about ready to

807
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,299
Foster going no no math okay

808
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,980
the average

809
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,919
employee Works about 40 hours per week

810
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,779
sorry employee

811
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:52,380
there are 52 weeks in a year so far does

812
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,360
my math check out

813
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,080
okay cool all right so 40 hours a week

814
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,880
times 52 weeks is 2080 hours

815
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,880
however we're kind of nice let's figure

816
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,080
we give our salary employee uh four

817
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,220
weeks off for holidays for PTO for sick

818
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,940
time what have you so that's 160 hours

819
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,179
so if we take the 2080 hours and

820
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,419
subtract their time off the 160 we get a

821
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,620
total amount of

822
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,360
1920 hours

823
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,820
is everyone following so far

824
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,418
kinda

825
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,500
one hour

826
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,299
of a year

827
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,000
is dedicated to social engineering or

828
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,380
sorry security awareness training

829
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,279
remember that number that are on the

830
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,399
board

831
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,399
one is point zero five percent of one

832
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,080
thousand 90 920.

833
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,179
that's less than half a percent

834
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,019
yet we're expecting these employees to

835
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,059
stop all of these attacks that they're

836
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,240
getting

837
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,820
but we're only investing less than a

838
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,279
percent into them for security awareness

839
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,620
training

840
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,080
this number should make you feel sick to

841
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,880
your stomach

842
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,700
this is not okay

843
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,440
yet when you think about social

844
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,179
engineering as an issue

845
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,100
your set of security awareness training

846
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,399
is the answer

847
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,019
you're telling me this is the answer

848
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,220
to stop these type of attacks

849
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,480
right spending all this money

850
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,580
4.91 million dollars

851
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,320
but we're only investing half of a

852
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,240
percent into training our employees

853
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,880
no wonder why this is 15 I'm surprised

854
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,600
it's not lower

855
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,800
this number is not okay

856
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,859
now I'm not saying

857
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,659
double down on security awareness

858
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,719
training and keep doing the same awful

859
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,280
training that they're getting

860
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,159
right when we're looking at fishing and

861
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,179
fishing

862
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,918
the training that I've seen that's

863
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,679
covered it doesn't cover any of the

864
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
tactics I use

865
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,159
any of them

866
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,099
why are we relying on vendors why aren't

867
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,619
we challenging vendors

868
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,659
can we roll our own training maybe

869
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,699
depending on your company

870
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,460
why is it not impactful why are they not

871
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,440
understanding

872
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,899
this number is so low we have to do

873
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,440
something different we have to or that

874
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,740
41 percent that 4.91 million dollars

875
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,960
that 15 those numbers aren't going to

876
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
change if anything they're probably

877
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,260
going to get worse because attackers are

878
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,180
still using social engineering they're

879
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,460
not going to stop why would you you're

880
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,740
doing something that's working

881
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,280
and if that number Still Remains

882
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,820
.05 percent

883
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,380
it's gonna it's gonna keep working

884
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,960
so I challenge you

885
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,940
to do something different

886
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,700
right look at that company that decided

887
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,800
to come up with the code word they did

888
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,599
something outside of the box

889
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,240
right increase the amount of time that

890
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,119
you invest into your employees to stop

891
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,400
these attacks

892
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,200
do some training yourself if you can

893
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,900
right if you're the vendors that you're

894
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,839
paying are not doing enough

895
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,960
see if you can do your own

896
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,420
or do an augment do your do your own in

897
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,280
addition to theirs look at the attacks

898
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,900
are actually happening against your

899
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,720
organization and train your employees to

900
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,180
stop those attacks

901
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,500
because I'm not calling asking for

902
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,660
credit card information I'm calling and

903
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,240
asking them to click a link and and put

904
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,560
their credit card information in put

905
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,480
their username and password in

906
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,220
I'm finding ways outside that and that's

907
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,040
what attackers are doing too

908
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,560
I hope you take this challenge now one

909
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,400
of the things I want to talk about

910
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,440
really fast is push notifications for

911
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,560
MFA

912
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,820
all right has anyone actually gotten a

913
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,040
push notification they're that close to

914
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,420
each other I've accidentally denied

915
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,099
myself a hundred times

916
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,800
right if we look at the Uber attack

917
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,480
everyone here heard of The Uber talk

918
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,740
that's been in the news recently

919
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,420
yeah this is what happened the attacker

920
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,980
right they had those username and

921
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,119
passwords

922
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,520
and all they did was they spammed the

923
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,280
push notification until the employee hit

924
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,440
accept

925
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,420
this is something I strongly disagree

926
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,060
with while I'm for MFA I know it's not

927
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,400
100 solution I am very against push

928
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,839
notifications if you're using this

929
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,079
organization I really encourage you to

930
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,359
look into it and consider different

931
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,520
types of options for MFA because push

932
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,560
fortifications

933
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,839
way too many mistakes and attackers are

934
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,980
now starting to take advantage of it

935
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,420
it's something that we've been taking

936
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,859
advantage for for years

937
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,160
all right I went fast uh I'm very

938
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,599
excited that I was able to share that

939
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,820
hopefully I encourage you all I

940
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,420
challenge you all because that five or

941
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,940
zero point five percent number

942
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,800
it's not okay

943
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,140
we can do better

944
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,460
all right thank you all

945
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,949
[Applause]
