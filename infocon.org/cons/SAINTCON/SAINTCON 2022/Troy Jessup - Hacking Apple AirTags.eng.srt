1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,780
all right welcome to the hacking the

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,839
Apple Air tags talk at St con

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,880
um this is a a talk I've been preparing

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,099
for a long time as I kind of previously

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,599
mentioned

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,639
um because I've been super interested in

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,680
these types of tracking Technologies and

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,320
what you can do and not do with them uh

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,699
and everything else and I'm one of those

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,220
early adopters of this technology of the

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,580
Apple Air tag when they came out with it

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,920
I put it on my backpack and on my keys

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,180
and all the other things that you think

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,740
that oh yeah this makes perfect sense

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,260
that we should be able to do this and

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,500
it's be it's become useful in one or two

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,140
cases in in me having those air tags

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,140
attached to my devices to me or for me

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,260
to actually go and find them and because

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,520
I've left them somewhere or whatever

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,980
else but anyways let's jump in we want

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,440
to talk about

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,379
air tags but before we do this this is

24
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,760
actually I mean this is the first

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,860
presentation I think I've had where I

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,480
actually have an honest to goodness real

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,100
disclaimer at the front that means

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,059
something

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,260
you know you're going to be in a good

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,339
presentation when there's a good

31
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,500
disclaimer right okay this talk is about

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,720
vulnerabilities

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,540
that exist in item tracking technology

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,060
that is already being exploited by

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,400
miscreants this is not

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,560
Jupiter standing up on a stage saying

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,479
okay hey we found all this new stuff and

38
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,220
we're irresponsibly disclosing this

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,080
information out there a lot of this

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,000
information is out there if you know

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,159
where to go find it and and things and

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,960
it is being exploited so this

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
presentation the content in this is not

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,979
to instruct you necessarily how to

45
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,960
perform these functions or these

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
exploits rather information that you

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,180
need to know about the risk inherent to

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,460
these devices and the risk that it

49
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,380
creates for our society because there

50
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,360
are some real risks that that are part

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
of this presentation or as part of this

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
technology thanks Chris for being up

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,700
here on the front row I'm going to be

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,560
asking you some questions later and is

55
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,460
dark matter in the room

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,240
no

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,579
okay if somebody sees Dark Matter come

58
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,560
come in he needs to be up here on the

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,700
front row too

60
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,799
okay so the rise of tracking

61
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,598
Technologies I've already kind of talked

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,180
a little bit about the Apple Air tag and

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,280
I mentioned tile and and you might be

64
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,660
familiar with there's more than just

65
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,300
Apple Air tags out there that provide

66
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,980
this this very similar tracking

67
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,379
technology

68
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,480
um but air tags are absolutely the most

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,520
popular and so we're going to focus just

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,920
specifically on this device today but

71
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,720
just know that many of the functions and

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
things that we're doing and talking

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,660
about today apply to some of these other

74
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,940
vendors as well but part of the reason

75
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,160
why apple is dominant inside of this

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,099
space now is because their technology

77
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,500
and their tracking technology and the

78
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,700
reporting technology that we'll talk

79
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,739
about here in a minute is all built in

80
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,879
turned on by default on devices or on

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,739
all iPhone types of devices and other

82
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,140
things and so the network and the

83
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,940
stability of being able to track things

84
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,060
is actually really good okay and so

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,280
here's just a courtesy thing uh for me

86
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
to remember to tell you that the way

87
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,239
that we normally use these devices is we

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,819
attach them to things like our keys our

89
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,560
backpack like this backpack right here

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,080
has an Apple Air tag hidden inside of it

91
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,659
so that if I ever leave it somewhere

92
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,580
that I can look it up on my phone and

93
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,200
say Hey where's my

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,900
where's my backpack and I can go find it

95
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,519
or have a good chance of finding it

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,459
Apple has taken that technology to quite

97
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,900
a large degree to where they actually

98
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,300
have the ultra what do they call Ultra

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,580
wide band technology to where as you get

100
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,560
closer to it you can actually get the

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,940
arrow and it'll tell you which direction

102
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,680
it is and those kinds of things and

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,580
we're going to actually talk about some

104
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,140
of that here in a minute but the

105
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,239
intended purpose for these devices is to

106
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,459
track device or items and things

107
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,360
going to give you a little bit of math

108
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,860
here just so that you kind of understand

109
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,260
how this technology works there are

110
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,840
actually three different uh frequency

111
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
Technologies in most of these tracking

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,159
systems specifically in their air tag

113
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,680
there are there are the three

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
um this one I'm going to talk about this

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,659
one Bluetooth low energy

116
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,860
um

117
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,560
frequency and and and information so you

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,420
kind of understand that the overall

119
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,959
process here so Bluetooth low energy or

120
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,079
ble is the method that is used to do the

121
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,699
updating and the tracking of Apple

122
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,940
Airtex it works in the 2.4 to 2.48

123
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,580
gigahertz range the maximum theoretical

124
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,100
range based off of the power the

125
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,479
frequency that's on and everything else

126
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,419
is about a hundred meters okay so 300

127
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,360
feet or so of range that where an air

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,759
tag can be detected by a device and get

129
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,320
a Bluetooth signal that's clear enough

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
to actually receive it and update it now

131
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,699
that's again maximum realistic it's

132
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,220
about 30 to 40 feet

133
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,139
is where you get that that data transfer

134
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,060
or where you can get a clear signal for

135
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,960
these things

136
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,419
it has about one to three megabits per

137
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,280
second maximum transfer rate because of

138
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,960
the limitations in bandwidth and

139
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,699
protocols none of this is going to be

140
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,199
super relevant later and we're not going

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,580
to gloss you over this is just kind of

142
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,259
give you an understanding of the

143
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,000
capabilities here it's got the the

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,620
transfers when they happen with an air

145
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,160
tag are 128 bit encrypted and so you

146
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,780
can't just sniff it over the wire and

147
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,160
listen for all the art attacks you can

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,139
tell that they're there because you can

149
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,720
see Bluetooth or ble beacons and things

150
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,460
but

151
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,500
the information that's being sent the

152
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,300
geographic locations and the Air Tech

153
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
IDs and all those other things are

154
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,780
encrypted as they come across but the

155
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,460
entire thing is designed to have less

156
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,780
than 15 milliamp milliamps of power draw

157
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,820
for it okay and so those of you that are

158
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,560
electronic Engineers or have built a

159
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,419
mini batch

160
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,160
might understand that that's not very

161
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
much power in fact that's less power

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,139
than most LEDs

163
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,500
use just like a single LED uses more

164
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,199
power in some cases than this so that's

165
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,320
how cool the technology has become to

166
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,539
where we have 30 feet sometimes up to

167
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,000
300 feet of communication from these

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
devices

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
that's that make this type of thing

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,340
possible so let's talk about how we use

171
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,620
that technology and how air tags work

172
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,360
many of you are geeky and probably

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
understand this already but in essence

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,380
the way that this works is an Apple Air

175
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,740
tag is pulled up and you Ma you've made

176
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,020
it with your phone using the NFC

177
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,759
function in the r tag which we'll talk

178
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,680
about a little bit later too

179
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,600
and you assign it a name and an address

180
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,840
and a couple of things and then what

181
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
happens is every time an air tag gets

182
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,699
picked up by a phone an app an Apple

183
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,160
iPhone in this case

184
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,919
your phone even though it's not or so

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
let's just say that I handed this off to

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,240
Super Tech guy over here and he went

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,580
downstairs his phone would continue to

188
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,560
transmit the location this device by

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,740
itself does not transmit its location to

190
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,360
some satellite system or anything else

191
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
it relies on iPhones all over the place

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,340
to pick up that really Beacon and talk

193
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,800
to it and then upload the location of

194
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,780
their phone to the approximate location

195
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,340
of the air tag does that make sense to

196
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,060
everybody

197
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,680
and then that information gets set up to

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,380
the cloud and updated whenever somebody

199
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,199
comes in proximity and so this is why

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,060
it's super reliable in the Apple world

201
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,740
because there's a lot of iPhones out

202
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,660
there that are listening for this thing

203
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,460
and just saying oh yeah I I heard this

204
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,740
air tag and everything else

205
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,259
so that's how this technology works

206
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,300
but there's some vulnerabilities that we

207
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,280
have here the Privacy problem is there's

208
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,460
nothing stopping somebody

209
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,800
from taking one of these air tags

210
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,620
and covertly walking up and dropping it

211
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,419
into somebody's backpack or whatever how

212
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,979
many times do you go into the bottom of

213
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,259
your backpack to see

214
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,120
what's down there right did somebody

215
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,500
drop one of these things into your

216
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,240
backpack I mean when you're looking for

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,500
that USBC ethernet adapter that we all

218
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,060
need in a moment's notice that we know

219
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,259
is at the bottom of the bag we might

220
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,900
find it right but in general somebody

221
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,819
could drop that into a backpack or some

222
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,259
other thing that you're carrying and you

223
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,660
might not find it for days weeks months

224
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,639
uh or years and so there's nothing

225
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,400
stopping these from being able to use or

226
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,020
to be able to track other people or

227
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,380
things okay Apple has done a pretty good

228
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,599
job of Trying to minimize this risk and

229
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
this potential uh with a bunch of

230
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,199
different protections but they have

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
their flaws and so we're going to talk

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,580
about some of those today

233
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,740
and so some of the Privacy solutions

234
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,240
that they've implemented in here has

235
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,280
anybody ever seen a message pop up on

236
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,020
their phone like this okay so we have

237
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,479
one or two in the room that an air tag

238
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,940
has been found moving with you the owner

239
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,479
of this item can see its location and it

240
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,539
says tap to open find my and see your

241
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,420
available options okay

242
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,580
so the way that this works or the way

243
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
that that in that message gets sent to

244
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,860
you is if you are in proximity to an

245
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,740
Apple Air tag and your location moves

246
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,260
and it's not your air tag what will

247
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,820
happen is your phone will see that

248
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,000
Beacon over and over and over again okay

249
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
especially if you're moving like hey I

250
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,320
moved from the convention center to

251
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,480
across the street to the hotel or I

252
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,580
moved over and went down to Chick-fil-A

253
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,680
or wherever it is and this thing is

254
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
following you for a period of time what

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,339
will happen is Apple has programmed them

256
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,440
to say hey this is a little bit weird

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
somebody's air tag is following you

258
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,899
um and what happens is you'll get this

259
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,800
alert

260
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,240
and then you have a couple of options

261
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,279
when you hit the find my button on there

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,720
and say hey what's going on this is

263
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
weird these are the options that you

264
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,959
have okay

265
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,700
so your current location could be seen

266
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,080
by the owner of this air tag and it'll

267
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,880
tell you when it first noticed that air

268
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,940
tag being attached to you approximately

269
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,279
okay and because of the size of the

270
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,660
screen was blown up you can't see the

271
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,459
whole thing but this error tag may be

272
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,779
attached to an item that you are

273
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,580
borrowing or it may be something that

274
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,779
somebody put on you and it gives you

275
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:52,980
some sort of warning that says hey

276
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,140
there's an air attack traveling with you

277
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,779
and if you scroll or you hit the

278
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,860
continue it gives you a couple of

279
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,019
options it says hey you know what it's

280
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,000
been detected near you you can play a

281
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
sound or you can pause safety alerts

282
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,019
meaning just don't tell me about this I

283
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,760
know I know about the air tag don't bug

284
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,100
me about it or whatever else you can

285
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,320
learn about this air tag which doesn't

286
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,760
give you much information other than

287
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,680
this Airtech doesn't belong to you and

288
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,600
if you think it's tracking you you

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
should call law enforcement is basically

290
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
what what that says or you can click on

291
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,959
the destructions or the destructions

292
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,080
that's funny the instructions to disable

293
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,399
the air tag

294
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,560
and so when you click on that you get

295
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,700
this fun little thing that says hey

296
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,260
disable the air tag all you have to do

297
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,320
is you have to turn the the cover about

298
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,300
20 degrees and pop it off and pull the

299
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,560
battery out and then you're good nobody

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
can track you anymore right

301
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,880
cool so Apple's implemented some cool

302
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,640
technology to alert you and and help you

303
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
figure out when things might be tracking

304
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
you or tracking items and things uh of

305
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,640
yours

306
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,800
and so when you play the sound do you

307
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,540
remember the sound we played

308
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,399
that's the sound that will pop up and

309
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,860
it'll play on repeat

310
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,839
it'll let you know so that you can find

311
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,399
it in the bottom of your bag right

312
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,339
because if you can't find the Apple Air

313
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,579
tag can you remove the battery no so

314
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,140
this is the protection that's in place

315
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,700
there's actually a tiny little speaker

316
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,160
inside of these devices

317
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,899
that you can actually have it play a

318
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,760
sound so kind of a cool technology

319
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,220
allows you to do things like that and

320
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,380
find the air tag and disable it

321
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,360
which is great

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
unless

323
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,720
unless you modify the speaker

324
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,420
okay so I've got a couple of videos here

325
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,279
that I think that they play by

326
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,600
themselves but let me see I might have

327
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,399
to click it to make it play these don't

328
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,579
have audio by the way you're good so

329
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,399
um I will click and see

330
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,980
the demo gods are with us I hope yeah so

331
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,620
this is me uh at home I'm gonna take you

332
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
on a real quick tour of the Apple Air

333
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,680
Attack this is a brand new Apple Air tag

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,079
with a plastic thing pulled off of it

335
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,060
and that's what it looks like it's about

336
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,300
an inch and an eighth in diameter and

337
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,220
you can turn that top little metal piece

338
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,019
and that's what the battery looks like

339
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,380
inside it's one of those 2032

340
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,880
um our CR2032 batteries and that is the

341
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
tour of what an Apple Air tag looks like

342
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,019
everybody's probably seen one how many

343
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,000
of you have an Apple Air tag

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,060
okay so that's great how many are in the

345
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,560
room

346
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,140
okay lots of them so there's all kinds

347
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,940
of Bluetooth beaconing going on in this

348
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,200
room right here

349
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,940
okay so this kind of gives you an

350
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,440
overview of what the air tag looks like

351
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,600
the next one is I'm going to show you

352
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,959
now live in Via video here

353
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,480
how to

354
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,760
mark this thing so that you can pry it

355
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,980
open to modify the speaker so if you

356
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,420
look at the video and you can come back

357
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,880
and refer to this later uh because it'll

358
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,220
be up on YouTube but where I'm putting

359
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,399
those little dots with that blue Sharpie

360
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,040
is the pry locations that you need to

361
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
know in order to successfully pry off

362
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
the back side of this Bluetooth or this

363
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,500
this device and so I'm just kind of

364
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,940
pointing into with tweezers so you can

365
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,800
kind of see and you can see them in

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,180
relation to the the snap or the snap

367
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,160
pieces and things so there you go so

368
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,660
everybody got that take your pictures if

369
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,880
you need to or whatever some of this is

370
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,260
published on the internet you don't have

371
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,480
to take your pictures I'm certainly it's

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,980
out there okay

373
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,600
but those are the pry locations they're

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,339
not completely symmetrical it's not like

375
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,500
a triangle thing they are specifically

376
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,899
offset just a little bit so that's those

377
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,760
are those pry points

378
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,399
okay we're talking about modification or

379
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,839
modding the speaker and so we have to

380
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,279
get inside the case and so this is a

381
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,720
video that's going to show us how we

382
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,500
take

383
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,760
the the pry locations I use uh you kind

384
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,620
of see a blunted

385
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,459
um

386
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,860
razor knife there

387
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,740
and I can pry right at that dot and you

388
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,019
have to use something really thin to get

389
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,940
in there and I found a razor knife don't

390
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,980
cut yourselves but I found the razor

391
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,600
knife to be the best option and all you

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
have to do is just kind of pry that and

393
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,019
it'll kind of pop up and once you get

394
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,660
two of those things propped up or popped

395
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,220
up you can generally just kind of pull

396
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,019
it off

397
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,279
um but uh you just kind of put your

398
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,740
knife in there there actually is audio

399
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,019
to this but all you hear is clicking and

400
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,000
things but then what you can do is you

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,279
can open that case up

402
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,440
the case has no electronic parts to it

403
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,180
or anything else it's just plastic and

404
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,240
it's got those those connector pieces on

405
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,700
there that we were prying against

406
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,920
um and if you do that then you don't

407
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,899
break off those pins this thing is

408
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,519
completely replaceable you can put it

409
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,380
back onto the Apple Air tag and nobody

410
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,420
would know otherwise and so I'm going to

411
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,740
pause this picture for just a moment

412
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,199
kind of give you a brief tour of some of

413
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,639
the internals here

414
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,220
of the of the Apple Air tag so right in

415
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,860
the very center that Big Shiny thing is

416
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,199
the speaker for an Apple Air tag and

417
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,820
it's actually connected with the two

418
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,339
maroon colored dots just to the up to

419
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,019
the top of it

420
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,399
um and

421
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,959
so some of the other things that you

422
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,000
can't or that you can see here this is

423
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
the U1 I think it's called the U1 chip

424
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,560
or whatever Apple calls their things in

425
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,300
these devices

426
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,000
um the these these items are sorry the

427
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
circuit board has a couple of the

428
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
electronics and other things built into

429
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,680
it and the case underneath which we'll

430
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,940
kind of show you some pictures of in a

431
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,399
minute are where the antennas are

432
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,160
connected but here is the process for

433
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,339
removing the speaker from this device

434
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,180
okay and then we'll kind of bring it all

435
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,500
together here in just a moment for you

436
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,660
but I just grab a pair of tweezers kind

437
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,399
of turn that on about a 90 degree angle

438
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,180
and you pry right in between

439
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,560
that piece and it is literally that easy

440
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,480
because all it is is it's barely tacked

441
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,100
in with some glue

442
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
and that speaker comes out and what

443
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,820
you're seeing there is the speaker wire

444
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,639
coil that they use that you can leave in

445
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,100
there and it's totally intact it works

446
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,860
if you put that speaker back in you have

447
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,240
to put a little dab of Super Glue to

448
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,860
hold the speaker in the center so it's

449
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,019
not touching the wire or other things

450
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,420
but if we pause here for just a moment

451
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,660
and think now if I were to in fact let's

452
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,680
just keep going

453
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,240
I'll show you how to reassemble this

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,100
thing okay so now we have the speaker

455
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,019
outside of this

456
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,060
I'm going to bend back those those

457
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,920
connectors just a little bit to make

458
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,240
sure that they're rigid and they hold

459
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,040
the case together and everything else

460
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,800
almost break it off but not quite you

461
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,479
know demo Gods right

462
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,699
but if you just kind of Bend those out

463
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,139
it doesn't need a lot it just needs to

464
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,000
make sure that the clasks can reconnect

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,940
well and hold that hold it together but

466
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,320
this is going to end up being an Apple

467
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,980
Air tag

468
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,820
that's put back in it only goes in one

469
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,259
way and you kind of see the orientation

470
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,899
by the the battery connector holes and

471
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,339
other things like that

472
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,600
and it takes a little bit of pressure

473
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
don't don't feel like you're going to

474
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,199
break the thing by pressing super hard

475
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,699
to get that last connector in

476
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,480
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

477
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,020
just kind of push

478
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,919
sometimes it goes in really easy

479
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,299
sometimes it doesn't but if you just

480
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,980
push super hard which I think I finally

481
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,660
do in the end it's one of those demo God

482
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,959
videos

483
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,559
but you can get that to seat back down

484
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,199
flush and so that air tag is now

485
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,620
functionally put back together minus the

486
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,360
speaker I'm just kind of rubbing off

487
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,799
some of the plastic that I've scratched

488
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,820
and other things so there you go cool

489
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,440
anybody ever done that done this before

490
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
yet

491
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,740
okay one person in the room that's great

492
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,140
it's out there

493
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,120
let me see what my next door okay and so

494
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
I think the last one here is just put

495
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,539
the battery in and off we go or whatever

496
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,919
but

497
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,299
um normally when you put the battery in

498
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,280
it'll make that chirping sound you'll

499
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,419
notice that you're not hearing a

500
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,200
chirping sound here

501
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,820
um this this device now if you can think

502
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,559
about it for just a moment if it was in

503
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,820
your backpack

504
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,679
you know or in that side pocket of your

505
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,039
backpack that you never ever use except

506
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,539
to put your water bottle in maybe once

507
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,740
in a while

508
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,380
and you got the alert and said hey an

509
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,419
air tax tracking you and you said hey I

510
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,100
want to play the sound to find it now

511
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,539
what

512
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,520
all right kind of scary maybe a little

513
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,840
bit

514
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,919
okay

515
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,720
so anyways that's a fully reassembled

516
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,640
fully capable

517
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,860
Air Tech

518
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,500
and so what I did to this one is I wrote

519
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,720
tracked by Jupiter on it

520
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,500
and I handed it to one of my friends

521
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,179
a couple of my friends are in the room

522
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,220
so I'm just gonna ask them you're gonna

523
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,660
have to be really loud in your response

524
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,360
but Chris over here goes by Sir ashram

525
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
in Discord and as is a part of our

526
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,740
committee all of the tracking by the way

527
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,700
that I did for this presentation is

528
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,400
consensual okay meaning that I had

529
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,559
talked to people and said hey I want to

530
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,620
covertly place an item on you at some

531
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,200
point in time and they were agreed to

532
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,000
but I handed one of these things off to

533
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
Chris

534
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
and

535
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
Chris did you ever find it or sorry did

536
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,100
you ever detect it

537
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,340
okay

538
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,059
right so for the benefit of the people

539
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,700
in the recording Chris is saying that it

540
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,100
was with him he knew it was with him it

541
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
was never detected

542
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
um meaning that it never popped up an

543
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,799
alert on a phone or anything else part

544
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,840
of that is because guess what

545
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
he's an Android user

546
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,299
how many Android users in the room

547
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,000
okay you guys are all trackable

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
right

549
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,080
Android users now the thing is is there

550
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,640
are apps that you can download onto your

551
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,260
Android and turn it into the Apple Air

552
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,059
tag kind of tracking

553
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,340
um technology and allow you to get those

554
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,020
alerts and things maybe that's something

555
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,840
you should do uh and things and so it

556
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,100
wasn't just Chris but there's other

557
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
people that we started doing some

558
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,720
tracking of uh and everything else

559
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,840
but at this point when you click the

560
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,419
play sound button it does no longer it

561
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,559
does no BBB anymore right and so it

562
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,440
becomes a covert tracking instrument now

563
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,580
a couple of the other things that I

564
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,260
should probably talk about is that in

565
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,020
the event that an Apple Air tag in

566
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,640
default mode without being modified

567
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,080
follows you around and it is not in the

568
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,320
vicinity of its owner's phone

569
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,780
or one of it one of the owner's devices

570
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,900
for a long period of time even if it's

571
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,660
not capable of sending an alert to your

572
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,919
phone if you're an Android User or

573
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,000
something else

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,520
the device itself will actually start

575
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,679
beeping on its own it'll beep

576
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,480
periodically and everything else is

577
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,260
Jared in the room

578
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,120
okay Jared so Jared is one of the other

579
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,919
people anybody from box elder School

580
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
District in the room

581
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
okay a couple of you so maybe you can

582
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,380
help with the story uh a little bit but

583
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,059
we sent one of these tracking devices

584
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,280
that was not modified

585
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,280
as a control with Jared and he kind of

586
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,480
carried it with him for a couple of days

587
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,100
and he took it into the office and he

588
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,440
took it home and it didn't last very

589
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,320
long before bbbb started happening

590
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,299
because hey it hasn't seen its owner's

591
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,360
device in a long time and so what are we

592
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,559
what are we going to do about this right

593
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,380
and so he ended up having to I think the

594
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,059
request of many of the Box Elder School

595
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,280
District employees as the story went for

596
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,799
me uh said we're tired of hearing the

597
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,260
beep dude let's turn this thing off and

598
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,240
so he actually brought it back to me in

599
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
battery removed mode because it was

600
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,340
annoying but they were also getting some

601
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,480
of those alerts that we were talking

602
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,620
about earlier

603
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,320
so anyways if you mod it no bbp anymore

604
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,260
and you've defeated that section of this

605
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,559
device right but we still get this okay

606
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,640
if you're on an Apple device you're

607
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,860
still going to get the hey my air tag

608
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,360
has found this air tag has been found

609
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,460
moving with us

610
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,900
um and

611
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,640
and so you're going to still get that

612
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,340
alert from time to time but there is a

613
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,280
new type of vulnerability that that is

614
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,740
inherent here and so we talked about how

615
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,659
the privacy or how that privacy

616
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,179
detection Works meaning that if that air

617
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,700
tag moves with you for a period of time

618
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,620
and apple I don't know what Apple's

619
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,780
settings are for these things but it's

620
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,240
not also in the proximity of its owner's

621
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,100
device and other things you're going to

622
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,840
get that alert and it's going to send

623
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,280
your phone is going to send that up to

624
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,720
the cloud it's going to say this Airtex

625
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,659
tracking me and and everything else

626
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,120
and and you'll get that alert based off

627
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,240
of that that following which is great

628
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,860
unless

629
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,360
you modify the antenna

630
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,039
okay and so this is a relatively new

631
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,140
disclosure this one's not super publicly

632
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,080
available and so I'm not going to fully

633
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,799
disclose how this works because I don't

634
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,980
I don't believe in dropping o days for

635
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,900
other organizations and other things now

636
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,280
this information is out on the internet

637
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,840
and it's available but it is not

638
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,200
mainstream but you can

639
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,780
you can modify the antenna in an Apple

640
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,020
Air tag to drop the signal level

641
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,120
and the the level of drop and other

642
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,620
things and we're talking specifically

643
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,659
about that Bluetooth low energy signal

644
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,380
you can drop it just enough to create

645
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,559
distance between you and that Bluetooth

646
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,520
device or that airtag device

647
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,740
periodically enough that it no longer

648
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,559
thinks that it's following you

649
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,880
okay

650
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,559
we're talking about hacking at this

651
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,520
point right

652
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,440
so here's a couple of things that you

653
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,940
can understand about the Apple Air tag

654
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,000
this modification also is significantly

655
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,460
harder okay Apple

656
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,080
glues

657
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,059
all of this stuff together so that top

658
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,100
part of the Apple Air tag that we showed

659
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,380
you how to remove is not glued in that's

660
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,780
just snapped in which is appropriate I

661
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,400
guess so that you can remove the speaker

662
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,280
part but to get to this part of the

663
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,520
Apple Air tag it requires a lot of glue

664
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,740
dissolving and other things to pull this

665
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,539
thing out this is a type of plastic the

666
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,640
black part of this is a type of I don't

667
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
know what the technical term is but it's

668
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,799
a super hard but brittle plastic and so

669
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
if you pry on it too much it'll just

670
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,120
crack and break it's not meant to be

671
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,679
pulled out of the Apple Air tag and so

672
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,559
this requires a lot of time and patience

673
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,900
and skill in order to be able to do this

674
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,299
in fact the couple of times that I did

675
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,640
it I've ruined more air tags than I

676
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,600
modded

677
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,820
okay just I'll be honest I've ruined

678
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,039
more air tags than I've modded

679
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,280
um but I have successfully modified a

680
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
couple of air tags with this technology

681
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,919
what I wanted to show you here is on the

682
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,600
left hand side is our Bluetooth LE

683
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,640
antenna and I'll just come right over

684
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
here I don't know if the camera will

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,360
catch me uh in doing this but

686
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
um over here these two pins on this

687
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,500
piece of plastic and again it's embedded

688
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,960
in the plastic and this ring right here

689
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,500
is that 2.4 gigahertz antenna but you

690
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,140
see this big spirally circle thing in

691
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,880
the center and that just happens to be

692
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
the NFC tag antenna and as far as I

693
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,559
understand about the technology and it

694
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,659
probably has more things that it does

695
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,760
but the only thing that I know that it

696
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,500
does is if I can put it up against my

697
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,059
phone and the phone can scan it it can

698
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,620
tell me something about that Apple Air

699
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,539
tag

700
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,200
um so it's just close proximity 13.84

701
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,440
megahertz uh antenna and then the ultra

702
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,620
wide band antenna is on this other side

703
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,720
and it comes off of these other two pins

704
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,400
and that's the one that you can use and

705
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,320
it uses a much higher frequency in the

706
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,360
six to eight gigahertz range and that's

707
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,340
the one that you're using to finite or

708
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,039
to find those finite control hey which

709
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,080
direction is this thing because there's

710
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,419
enough diversity in how that antenna

711
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,659
works to provide directional finding uh

712
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,279
if you've got the technology built in so

713
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,679
cool things

714
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
um but this is what that antenna

715
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,740
structure looks like and it gets very

716
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,659
brittle very hard to mod and everything

717
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,460
else but

718
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,279
I'm not going to show you how to modify

719
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,500
this but I will show you where to modify

720
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,059
this on an Apple Air tag and so you can

721
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,340
appropriately modify an Apple Air tag

722
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,500
and create some resistance and again the

723
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,799
resistance value is very specific

724
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,880
but not something that I'm going to

725
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,860
disclose here publicly that you can

726
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,740
modify here to lower the energy level of

727
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,740
that antenna just enough to where it

728
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,860
still has the opportunity to get close

729
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,779
proximity updates so if somebody is

730
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,000
close like really close to that Apple

731
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Air tag within three or four feet

732
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,380
you'll still get those Bluetooth beacons

733
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,059
and they'll work properly and your phone

734
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,559
if you're the one carrying the air tag

735
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,840
will likely upload and update that thing

736
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,539
but if you're much further away than

737
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,940
that then it reduces the chances so your

738
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,799
phone gets a break

739
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,860
from seeing that Apple Air tag and then

740
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,900
it sees it again and there's less

741
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,279
likelihood it doesn't eliminate

742
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,320
completely the detection capabilities

743
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,960
but there's a much less likelihood of

744
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,220
that device actually picking up

745
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,960
consistently that Apple Air tag and then

746
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,120
reporting it as a Air Attack following

747
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,179
you kind of scary right

748
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,460
are you just all in awe or are you tired

749
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,140
or

750
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,039
okay let's talk about some legalities

751
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,559
so obviously

752
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,120
um modifying hardware and some other

753
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,000
things you could run afoul of some laws

754
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,580
and some other things uh we don't feel

755
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,260
like anything that we've done up to this

756
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,299
point uh in modifying antennas has

757
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,679
changed anything in the way of frequency

758
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,320
broadcasting or anything else in fact

759
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,179
what we've done is we've lowered

760
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,980
frequency power and other things and so

761
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,659
we don't think we've run afoul of the

762
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,140
FCC but there might be some FCC

763
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,000
regulations that prevent this type of

764
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,640
thing I'm disclosing that we're just

765
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,380
doing security research here folks you

766
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,020
know don't don't come at me uh and such

767
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,659
but there are some legalities that are

768
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,100
associated with this there are

769
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,440
absolutely in all 50 states and

770
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,340
federally laws about or that prevent you

771
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,039
from Legally tracking somebody with an

772
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,100
Apple Air tag okay so it is not legal to

773
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,559
without consent drop an Apple Air tag in

774
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
somebody's box so it shouldn't become

775
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,580
the new sync con meme of hey we're

776
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,020
instead of the little babies all over

777
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,779
the place you've probably seen them like

778
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,400
instead of dropping babies that were

779
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,559
dropping 20 air tags all over the place

780
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,840
to track people let's not turn that into

781
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,360
a meme but it is illegal to do that

782
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,220
without consent uh so I wanted to make

783
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,480
sure that you understand that that I'm

784
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,400
not trying to say hey yeah go go try

785
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,159
this out and track your friends or your

786
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,039
girlfriends or your ex's and things like

787
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,440
that because that's creepy wrong and

788
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,900
immoral and so there are some legalities

789
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,360
uh that are in play with this with this

790
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,080
thing

791
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,320
that being said with consent is dark

792
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,760
matter in the room yet he was going to

793
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,559
show up but I know he's super busy today

794
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,460
too

795
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,440
we started tracking Dark Matter does

796
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,940
everybody know who dark matter is he's

797
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,960
kind of one of the saint Khan

798
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,520
personalities we'll call him an

799
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,919
influencer of sorts we really love Dark

800
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,320
Matter he's always fun happy and

801
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,240
everything else and so we decided to

802
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,340
find out where does this dude chill out

803
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,539
and sleep

804
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,159
all right so we're going to take you

805
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,600
through a little story of

806
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,899
human tracking so with his consent I

807
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,700
gave him an Apple Air tag and said put

808
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,080
it in your pocket just leave it there

809
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,120
and you know throughout the con so he

810
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,080
did

811
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,179
and so at this point what you'll see

812
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,980
here are a couple of air tags that are

813
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,980
in frame one of which is El machete

814
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,960
which is Chris over here because he

815
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,419
still had his air tag on him so his

816
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,520
location is also the Provo Marriott in

817
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,720
case you're wondering where we're where

818
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,760
we're staying

819
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,260
um and then there's two of the cactuses

820
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,600
and those are uh in reference to the

821
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,179
Wi-Fi cactus that dark matter is super

822
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,860
famous for and so the one that's the

823
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,620
biggest one is the Dark Matter air tag

824
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,480
which is the one that's on his person

825
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,419
and so all I so we kind of made it a

826
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,860
game for the last couple of nights like

827
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,020
okay let's go find dark matter and so

828
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,600
off we went

829
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,419
so there was a point in time where

830
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,940
we got an alert that hey dark matter is

831
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,039
within range oh okay great so he's

832
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,320
inside of that Expo space somewhere

833
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,779
and so we went to the ultra band mode

834
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:31,860
and those of you that are familiar with

835
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,080
that cool Apple technologies that tells

836
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,140
you very accurately within how like a

837
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,940
couple of inches if you're super close

838
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,679
but within a couple of feet of where you

839
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,440
are and so we started walking around

840
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,659
we know he's here somewhere because it's

841
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,059
showing us and we eventually found him

842
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,980
over watching somebody doing something

843
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,720
on the chill out stage

844
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,000
uh over there so that is a dark matter

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
siding so now if you don't know who we

846
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,080
were talking about you can recognize the

847
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,840
face and name uh so that's dark matter

848
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,539
and we were about 10 feet away from him

849
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:06,419
when we took that screenshot

850
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,419
a couple of other times uh we were he

851
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,299
was moving so much that we had problems

852
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,860
tracking him but we knew he was in the

853
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Proxima or the vicinity and so we would

854
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,960
get a beacon from this thing from over

855
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,539
at the lobby or whatever while he's over

856
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,279
at hack in the Box we're getting you

857
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,159
know hey it's around he's somewhere here

858
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,740
and so as soon as we kind of got a

859
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,059
little bit closer sometimes it would

860
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,039
change from hey this item's moving and

861
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,960
precisely location can't be determined

862
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,919
to finally oh yeah he's he's you know

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,840
400 feet away or 200 feet away or

864
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,640
whatever else and so we track him down

865
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,679
so this is catching dark matter at the

866
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,899
hack in the Box uh which if you haven't

867
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,880
checked that out it's across the street

868
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,159
at the Marriott it's an unofficial event

869
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,020
that we do at St con but that's where

870
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,820
some of our Keynotes are hanging out you

871
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,440
can go over and chat with some some of

872
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
the best and brightest security folks in

873
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,419
the in the industry and in the community

874
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,740
over there in the evenings

875
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,600
uh so this is a great Dark Matter

876
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,980
sighting here too

877
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,399
but this was the creepy one okay so this

878
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,600
is a little bit later in the evening

879
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,240
this is hey we want to find out where

880
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,279
Dark Matter sleeps

881
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,080
and so we started going around the hotel

882
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,880
and my wife should have taken pictures

883
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,740
because I was literally taking my phone

884
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,200
and I was just holding it up to every

885
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,820
single door

886
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
all the way down the hallway looking for

887
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,919
that first signal that says hey oh yeah

888
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,140
I I think I found it or it's in

889
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,179
proximity or whatever else and it didn't

890
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,460
take very long to

891
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,320
get a little bit closer it's like hey I

892
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,820
think we have that air tag but hold on

893
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,500
you get a little bit closer and then all

894
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,940
of a sudden the screen pops up and it

895
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,440
turns green and it gives you an arrow

896
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,840
and you're like oh yeah you know and and

897
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,059
so we found our way down and I hope I

898
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,220
obscured the room number I think I did a

899
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,720
pretty good job doing it but

900
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,220
I stand up in front of that door and

901
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,440
it's like yes that air tag is seven feet

902
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,720
away while I'm standing on the outside

903
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,880
of that door and so here's that video of

904
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,260
you might want to turn up just a tiny

905
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,320
bit

906
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,120
I think so

907
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,480
oh hello buddy how's it going amazing

908
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,980
would you like to come and see some neat

909
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,840
things oh I'd love to come see some neat

910
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,879
things but do you know how I found you

911
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,140
let me guess

912
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,100
that's the thing

913
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,480
all right at which time he proceeded to

914
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,100
show me some of I mean what you can't

915
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,899
see because he's obscuring a little bit

916
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,559
are some of the coolest things that many

917
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,179
of you that go and stay at a security

918
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,340
conference like Defcon or whatever you

919
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,620
like feel the bag with I might need a

920
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,120
soldering iron and I might need this

921
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,399
specialized soldering iron and and I

922
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,019
need this really cool electronic board

923
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,980
to convert s you know SDA to SC SDC or

924
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,320
all those things so we we talked for a

925
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,940
few minutes and he showed me some of the

926
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,559
cool Technologies actually working on

927
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,059
designing a super dense high capacity

928
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,059
storage array uh that's in like the 800

929
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,679
terabytes in the size of about a GPU

930
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,199
yeah so that's a good thing if you're if

931
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,280
you're interested in that kind of stuff

932
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,199
go talk with him because he's doing that

933
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,239
stuff in a hotel room in Provo Utah

934
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,580
right now

935
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,260
what's that

936
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,540
and oh and if he he did get it to work

937
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,520
last night I'm super excited for him and

938
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,960
that's maybe why he's not here because

939
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,239
he's he's probably just jumping up and

940
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,219
down the hallways over there but anyways

941
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,260
tracking technology can be used

942
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,179
nefariously what I want to just kind of

943
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,859
say is there are some vulnerabilities in

944
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,780
this technology

945
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,179
um that that you still need to be

946
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,800
addressed

947
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,659
um I did want to throw this up so we had

948
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,760
the Dark Matter tracker we also had

949
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,560
Jared Ray that we called the Ray-Bans

950
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
tracker we had the machete tracker and

951
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,020
other things and so I was able to get an

952
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,060
approximate location of the El machete

953
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,560
so that's not really where his house is

954
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,660
it's in a big circle there but you can

955
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,400
also see that I track my backpack which

956
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,080
the battery's running low so if somebody

957
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,820
wants to steal it they can just wait out

958
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,660
the

959
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,700
the battery power for me not to be able

960
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,740
to track it anymore I also throw one in

961
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,720
my car if any of my kids are in the room

962
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,240
if you take my car

963
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,740
um I'm going to know where the car is

964
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,960
you know in case I need to go rescue it

965
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
or something somewhere

966
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,160
um but anyways the addresses were

967
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,900
published where the the red is showing

968
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,099
up here so I'm not going to show you

969
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,500
what those uh addresses were uh

970
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,020
specifically but anyways

971
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,060
it does work many of you have probably

972
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,920
used it before maybe you didn't realize

973
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,240
that there's vulnerabilities and other

974
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,700
things inside of that again I want to

975
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,560
stress the legalities of doing what

976
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,380
we're doing uh with with modifying air

977
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,740
tags it's creepy it's not an appropriate

978
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,579
thing to do for

979
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,780
exploitation and other things of other

980
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,460
people's stuff maybe this is a good time

981
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,079
to tell you you probably started hearing

982
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,300
in the news the use of Apple air attacks

983
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,420
to track vehicles and other things that

984
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,400
uh some of the mysterians out there are

985
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,980
using air tags to track really nice cars

986
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,800
that are at a hotel or somewhere else

987
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,560
and they're tracking them to see if they

988
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,960
can find a more opportune place to steal

989
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,740
them

990
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,920
okay it's a thing out there

991
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,800
um human trafficking is a very sad but

992
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,320
real problem with air tag type of

993
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
tracking things uh human trafficking is

994
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,800
real and it needs and it's something

995
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,060
that's enabled by some of this

996
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,220
technology in some cases

997
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,599
so

998
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,460
there are a lot of creepy things that

999
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,880
you can do my resp my request is that

1000
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,800
you always hack responsibly when you're

1001
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,720
doing these types of things it's fun to

1002
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,040
understand vulnerabilities in fact

1003
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,020
learning about vulnerabilities whether

1004
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,000
it's in a piece of software on a web

1005
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,640
system or if it's a you know lock or

1006
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,740
something else

1007
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,900
um helps us understand the possibilities

1008
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,000
of what can be and that's what makes us

1009
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
good I.T and Security Professionals

1010
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,220
um but use your power for good when you

1011
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,560
start having that hacker mindset it's

1012
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,820
important to make sure that you're doing

1013
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,920
good things with it and so I'm hoping

1014
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,359
that that comes that gets conveyed

1015
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,119
really well here uh I do need to offer

1016
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,579
some credits because in this case I

1017
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,740
stand on the shoulders of giants here

1018
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,480
there's a lot of folks that have done

1019
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,579
air tag research that have gone before

1020
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,500
and I've borrowed some of their

1021
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,599
information and changed it augmented it

1022
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,359
and things so if you want to go look up

1023
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,300
some of these folks uh Adam catley and

1024
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,160
Colin o'flynn have done some of the best

1025
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,320
research that I've seen out there for

1026
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,680
air tax Tim Anderson uh he's actually a

1027
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,540
local community member uh he's part of

1028
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,200
the DC 801 or the 801 Labs crew uh he is

1029
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,480
the one that I consulted with on antenna

1030
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,640
technology modifications and that's why

1031
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,920
this is new because he and I were

1032
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,839
working through how do you take this

1033
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,119
antenna and how do you attenuate it just

1034
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,460
enough to lower the power mod the power

1035
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,720
levels

1036
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,859
but not Nerf it or completely kill it

1037
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,960
um and such and so local community guy

1038
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,240
smart as a whip and when when it comes

1039
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,920
to electrical engineering things and

1040
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,940
then I've got a couple of the other

1041
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,160
folks uh thanks to dark matter and for

1042
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,839
being willing to let me actually human

1043
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,079
traffic track him uh kind of things

1044
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,480
codex econo's my son he is the one that

1045
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,040
actually took a couple of the air tags

1046
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,380
and drove around with them to get that

1047
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,960
first hey your iPhone is being tracked

1048
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,240
are your your or you're being followed

1049
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
by an air attack and then of course my

1050
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,260
wife who was also part of some of that

1051
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,540
Air Attack tracking things so those are

1052
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,980
the credits uh that I think are

1053
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,880
appropriate to make sure they're

1054
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,099
included in the recording and that only

1055
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,380
took 38 minutes to talk about so there's

1056
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,480
absolutely some time for questions if

1057
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,980
you have them

1058
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,359
does anybody have questions over here

1059
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,540
first

1060
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,660
okay that's a great question and I'll

1061
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,400
repeat it for the recording is there

1062
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,560
anything more than just like a MAC

1063
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,160
address equivalent in that ble broadcast

1064
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,380
that can be picked up or be spoofed to

1065
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,200
somehow create more churn or or

1066
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,480
obviously Kate or whatever that protocol

1067
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,980
and the answer that I have for you is

1068
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,160
likely but I haven't done enough I'm not

1069
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,020
a Bluetooth low energy expert I don't

1070
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,940
know that protocol very well I know it

1071
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,380
exists and I know how it sort of

1072
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,060
functions and what frequencies and stuff

1073
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,920
but I don't know does anybody know the

1074
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,400
answer to that question authoritatively

1075
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,040
okay so sorry I can't solve that problem

1076
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,300
for you there was a question over here

1077
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,440
go ahead really loud

1078
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,339
nope

1079
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,920
well if it was me it would have been

1080
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,900
consensual because I don't roll like

1081
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,700
that so if you do have something

1082
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,800
tracking you that could be somebody else

1083
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
messing around with things so be aware

1084
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,800
of that there was a question right here

1085
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,980
sorry

1086
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,400
what is the best defense against these

1087
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,020
types of issues and things that's a

1088
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,520
great question and I did a lot of

1089
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,619
thinking about that how do you defend

1090
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,359
against somebody dropping one of these

1091
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,119
modded Apple Air tags in your in your

1092
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,579
bag right here might have the answer go

1093
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,560
ahead

1094
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,680
copper line your backpack

1095
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,020
okay make make your backpack a faraday

1096
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,880
cage and the thing is that's actually an

1097
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,460
appropriate uh method of doing things

1098
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,380
um but there's not a lot of great

1099
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,240
defenses what we rely on right now is

1100
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,540
the manufacturer to provide the privacy

1101
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,700
and Technical Solutions to try and keep

1102
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,220
that at Bay I think you know even though

1103
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,260
we've given an apple a lot of flack here

1104
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,940
in some of the vulnerabilities in their

1105
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,280
stuff they have done the most to

1106
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,140
actually try and mitigate most of these

1107
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,339
types of things and so they're

1108
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,900
constantly tweaking and changing that

1109
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,460
technology to make it less relevant and

1110
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,460
less useful uh and things but it still

1111
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,260
persists I don't have a great answer let

1112
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,520
me come here next and then we'll come up

1113
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,640
here

1114
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,460
okay if the question is for the

1115
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,240
recording again if I take and modify an

1116
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,859
Apple Air tag and remove the speaker and

1117
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,800
attach it to my bike and use it to track

1118
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,800
a thief that has stolen my bike is that

1119
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,680
legal and you're right I am not a lawyer

1120
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,140
this is not legal advice but I can't

1121
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,240
imagine a scenario where that is illegal

1122
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,720
to use it to track your item and locate

1123
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,099
it I don't think that gives you

1124
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,200
permission to confront or create a

1125
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,599
situation with the person who is doing

1126
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,599
the thieving as it were so I don't know

1127
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,700
who was next technically but oh please

1128
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,879
do

1129
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,180
track yeah

1130
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,040
but consult a lawyer if you're really

1131
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,980
interested in that I I am not a lawyer

1132
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,880
over here

1133
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,339
okay is there a way to consistently scan

1134
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,619
for and identify signals with an air tag

1135
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,020
there are I am aware of but didn't have

1136
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,500
the money to go invest in Bluetooth low

1137
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,320
energy tracking and decoding systems and

1138
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,599
detection things as part of this talk

1139
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,640
and maybe that's the next Rabbit Hole I

1140
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,320
go down and we'll revisit this topic

1141
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,540
next year but yes the technology does

1142
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,280
exist out there I'm just not familiar

1143
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,720
with it and haven't had a lot of

1144
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,060
Hands-On with it so other questions

1145
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,200
right here back in the purple

1146
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,480
okay another great question how does

1147
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,740
this compare to some of the other ones

1148
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,780
like chip low or tile and other things

1149
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,560
so those have have to have people that

1150
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,780
participate in that Community uh in

1151
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,700
order for them to even be super active

1152
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,619
in the tracking capabilities and other

1153
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,540
things you might get a hey it was your

1154
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,940
stolen bike was in this park somewhere

1155
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,560
or whatever

1156
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,900
um but as it Compares a lot of the same

1157
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,700
modifications and other things that

1158
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,200
we've talked about here are reasonable

1159
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,359
or possible uh with those types of

1160
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,380
things and so there are some

1161
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,300
vulnerabilities what I would say is that

1162
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,060
their privacy issue or their privacy

1163
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,940
tracking and or or sorry their privacy

1164
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,140
defenses and other things that are

1165
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,940
inherent in the technology is probably

1166
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,300
not as well developed or is is lessened

1167
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,240
by the less ubiquitous nature of the

1168
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,520
tracking technology that's all inherent

1169
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,140
in every iPhone and other things like

1170
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,940
you have to have the Tile app on your

1171
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,920
phone you have to be listening for it

1172
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,180
you know those kinds of things and some

1173
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,220
of those other vendors so it's not the

1174
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,480
same that way go ahead

1175
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,640
okay that's a great question what

1176
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,040
software do you need on your Apple

1177
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,760
device to

1178
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,040
participate in this update the location

1179
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,200
of air tags as you walk by them right

1180
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,500
the answer is not surprising

1181
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,359
it's baked in

1182
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,119
it is part of iOS and has been since I

1183
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,420
think 13 or 14. I don't don't quote me

1184
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,280
on the specific iOS version but that

1185
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,380
technology was developed and rolled out

1186
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,940
the thing is is if you've got one of

1187
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,180
those new M1 or M2 Max

1188
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,480
it's built into your Mac your Mac has a

1189
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,240
Tracker in it by default that gets

1190
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,640
associated with your Apple ID in fact if

1191
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,900
that's surprising to you and you have

1192
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,819
one of those devices go to your find my

1193
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,200
app right now and click on the items tab

1194
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,079
of of your uh find my it's going to have

1195
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,300
like find my people find my something

1196
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,160
and then find items

1197
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,640
yeah and

1198
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,760
I am I'm not aware of a method to do

1199
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
that there may be some sort of backway

1200
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,319
privacy thing to say I don't want to

1201
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,060
participate in that Network I'm just not

1202
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,440
aware of it I've not done that research

1203
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,940
but it's a good good question though

1204
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,920
thank you for asking it any other ones

1205
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,240
before we break out

1206
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,700
Bring It On Dave

1207
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,500
here we go

1208
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,740
right

1209
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,619
decades to change laws right

1210
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,020
yeah so I'll repeat some of that and and

1211
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,020
so so Dave is up to date on a lot of his

1212
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,660
FCC laws and regulations which is very

1213
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,000
dave-like which is awesome thank you and

1214
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,500
he's he is talking specifically about

1215
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,380
FCC part 15 which deals with unlicensed

1216
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,540
broadcasters the reason why it's legal

1217
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,400
for them to do unlicensed broadcasting

1218
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,079
on these because it's in that 2.4

1219
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,180
gigahertz range which is unlicensed

1220
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,460
broadcasting it's it's the frequency set

1221
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,740
that's open to the world uh and things

1222
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,619
but yes I'm also aware that there's not

1223
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,460
any specific portion of that that limits

1224
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,839
um antenna modifications in that

1225
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,400
frequency range again I don't think

1226
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,560
we've run afoul of anything uh with

1227
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,040
lowering the power of uh of that antenna

1228
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,200
enough what we have found is when we did

1229
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,440
that the battery life of that air tag is

1230
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,079
was changed significantly too though I

1231
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,819
mean it takes more power to power that

1232
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,160
antenna with a resistor than it does

1233
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,220
without it kind of thing so but anyways

1234
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,560
I digress last call for questions if you

1235
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,200
got them

1236
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,118
okay last one right over here

1237
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,160
okay so the question to repeat in case

1238
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,780
some of you couldn't hear that

1239
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,079
I heard was we've talked about using air

1240
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,420
tags nefariously to track other people

1241
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,579
but are there any vulnerabilities known

1242
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,180
on other people using Bluetooth leak

1243
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,700
beacons and other things to track you

1244
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,500
because you are using the technology is

1245
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,359
that a good read back of your question

1246
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,400
and the answer to that is I'm not aware

1247
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,079
of anything part of that encryption

1248
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,520
standard that we talked about earlier

1249
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,260
does encrypt all the communications

1250
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,359
between the air tags I think it's

1251
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,780
reasonable for somebody to identify that

1252
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,980
this air tag or this ble Beacon ID is

1253
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,359
associated with an air tag that's

1254
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,980
associated with super tech guy over here

1255
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,119
and use a third-party sniffing device to

1256
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,280
track that specific Beacon and kind of

1257
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,619
triangulate the best they can at 2.4

1258
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,200
gigahertz which isn't great but

1259
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,060
um and maybe do that but I'm not aware

1260
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,339
of any widely available exploit or

1261
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,380
vulnerability in that regard yeah Dave

1262
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,740
go ahead

1263
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,180
actually that is a good point because

1264
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,500
I've read some of that same information

1265
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,800
the little tire pressure things let's

1266
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,480
talk about tracking you for a second

1267
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,760
without your knowledge the tire pressure

1268
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
monitor in your car the one that pops up

1269
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,540
the little light on your dashboard that

1270
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,460
says your tire pressure is low that's a

1271
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,500
2.4 gigahertz

1272
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,720
sensor in your tire that monitors air

1273
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,040
pressure and when it drops below a

1274
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,920
certain threshold tells the ECM of that

1275
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,420
of that car that hey the tire pressure

1276
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,319
is low but it broadcasts

1277
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,780
on a regular basis and so if you are

1278
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,599
going into a parking garage uh and other

1279
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,980
things that's sometimes how they're

1280
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,440
determining whether or not like you're

1281
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,599
it's the same vehicle coming in or out

1282
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,040
and those kinds of things so yeah

1283
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,079
there's all kinds of things that are

1284
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,180
sort of like this I don't know of a tire

1285
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,220
tracking app but that would be cool

1286
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,599
somebody wants to build that that's

1287
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,460
probably worth a couple bucks on on the

1288
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,740
on the Apple App Store

1289
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,780
so anyways thank you I know we're

1290
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,160
letting you out a little bit early and

1291
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,660
I'm sorry I didn't have more slides

1292
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,160
planned and things but I wanted to give

1293
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,140
you that exposure but we appreciate you

1294
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,579
being here I appreciate you

1295
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:25,500
participating in this presentation and

1296
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,460
uh have the good rest of your con

1297
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:35,130
[Applause]
