long it is a very impressive probably

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,320
longer than my arm maybe both arms

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,220
combined the core group Tool red team

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,519
Alliance books

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,779
runs has probably around a training on

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,279
physical security for pretty much every

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,700
org that exists I was looking at list it

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,440
is massively long uh it's super

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,820
impressive if you haven't seen him on

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,860
YouTube you're about to it's my pleasure

to introduce deviant Olaf

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,120
how's it going

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,739
we could hear me earlier can we hear me

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:50,460
now

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,079
give me a thumbs up if you can hear me

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,239
all right there's going to be a lot of

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,559
show of hands that I'm going to ask you

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,660
so we had the lighting doing little

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,100
things earlier you can you can bring

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,539
these house lights up like another

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,340
couple clicks because I would love to

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,339
see everyone out there

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,740
we'll work on that as we're going uh and

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,960
as we're also going I will mention this

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,540
is not going to be like most of my usual

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,240
talks uh very specifically I'm going to

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,260
call out

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,000
things that are outside of the scope of

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
most of our careers but speaking about

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,380
risk and speaking about preparedness for

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,820
risk the lighting is perfect thank you

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,979
we are going to talk about some things

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,320
that are political we're going to talk a

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,299
lot about a lot of underrepresented

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,619
people and a lot of minorities and the

40
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,939
threats they face that are very

41
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,799
different than the threats people that

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,900
look like me and a lot of you face

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,640
we'll talk about firearms because I do

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,259
that a lot I know it's a hot subject

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,759
it's not the whole talk it's just one

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,460
section and we are going to talk about

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
the penal system and what happens to

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,420
people in cages and how to prevent that

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,100
from happening to you and your loved

50
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,200
ones and how to respond and what you

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,119
will go through if someone you know

52
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,579
winds up facing legal system

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,920
I said my usual abundance swearing I've

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,439
been trying to dial it back especially I

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,299
mean snow and Jason set really nice

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,700
examples and I asked the organizers I

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
was like so how how family friendly is

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,060
this event like we try to keep it pretty

59
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,520
clean I was like well [ __ ]

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
um no we'll see we'll see maybe this

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
will finally be a talk that um that my

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
mom would be proud of although she won't

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,920
watch this one because of what's in it

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,440
no it's uh for real this is I'm not just

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,580
one of those things where you throw a

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,660
slide like that up like no offense at

67
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,220
all if it gets too real for you in this

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,440
room step outside I'll just assume that

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
you wanted lunch because we're running a

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,080
little behind and it's not a problem

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,459
we're gonna we're gonna talk about some

72
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,540
real stuff

73
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,160
starting off just about risk though

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
right how many people drive a car

75
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
right

76
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,879
life has risks in it driving a car it

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
has risks we try to learn those risks we

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
try to mitigate for those risks and when

79
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,819
people talk about this it's usually them

80
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,780
saying well you're going to get

81
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,060
somewhere everybody drives a car because

82
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,040
we think about Highway accident as risk

83
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,300
but what about other risks when you

84
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
drive a car have you ever had a problem

85
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,660
with your car where it wouldn't start or

86
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,640
wasn't running reliably you know and you

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,900
couldn't happen to be able to diagnose

88
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,760
it or fix it yourself

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
how prepared you were in that moment and

90
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
what the severity of that impact was can

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,739
change how much anxiety it clenched you

92
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,500
up how much you know you got impacted if

93
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
you're you know out on the roadside it's

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,620
not it's not working oh man what am I

95
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,080
going to do maybe you're someone who has

96
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,700
a tow service like maybe you have a

97
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,260
garage in town that you could maybe it's

98
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,540
even not dead yet like the car is kind

99
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,220
of drivable it's just making really bad

100
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,080
noises and you're like I don't know I

101
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,580
checked the parts that are usually noisy

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,780
and I can't figure it out so you kind of

103
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,220
Limp it to the garage

104
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,260
and you know there's a need to get there

105
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,900
but the urgency isn't extreme like you

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,760
drove there you might you might be able

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,400
to borrow a car or call somebody you

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,780
know you've got shelter over your head

109
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,040
the worst thing you're really facing is

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
maybe getting ripped off if you don't

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
have a person you like to go to if

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,140
you've got a garage you go to all the

113
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,340
time they've been in your family you're

114
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,720
pretty squared away you can you can

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
address that

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,780
what if you're not in your area what if

117
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,040
you're far from home and you're on a

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,420
highway and you now you're like oh man

119
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400
this this car is broken down I think

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,140
we're calling a tow truck do you know

121
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,700
who you would call do you know if you

122
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,799
have insurance that will cover a tow or

123
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,659
not do you know if that's the fastest

124
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,760
way to get a tow or or do you spend like

125
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,500
an hour and a half just on the side of

126
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,120
the road waiting in some call center and

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
it would have been oh really I could

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,579
have just called the local guy and it

129
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,019
would have been 20 minutes in a you know

130
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,600
35 do you know how far a tow truck will

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,639
take you they have range sometimes

132
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,900
they'll say yeah well you might have

133
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,580
that garage but I'm not going to take

134
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,720
you all the way across town I can only

135
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
take you to these garages these are

136
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
things that can jam you up if you didn't

137
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,540
plan in advance will they drive you in

138
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,160
in their car or do you have to get a

139
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
lift you have a bunch of stuff in your

140
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
car do you need to get a lift XL or

141
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,020
something so like again we're talking

142
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,660
about a little more urgency here what if

143
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,919
you're in a situation where there is no

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,780
outside support what if you do a lot of

145
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,300
backcountry camping off-roading what if

146
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,560
you live in a place with harsh climate

147
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,440
like this like at this point stranded

148
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,080
away from Services that's a real urgent

149
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,340
matter that's we're getting into almost

150
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,960
life or death depends on how far out

151
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,460
you're going in the mountains do you

152
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,560
have a kit on you do you have first aid

153
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
supplies a little fire extinguisher a

154
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,320
jump box right

155
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
how many of you have that's a curious

156
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,740
question I have a little jump box in my

157
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,000
truck right if my battery said who has

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
one

159
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,600
you ever tested it

160
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,100
that's not all those hands I mean so

161
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,020
maybe some maybe you tested it but you

162
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,280
didn't really test it you tested it by

163
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,660
using it the first time you needed it

164
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,340
and you're like cool I'm glad it worked

165
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,919
or maybe it didn't but you were just you

166
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,120
know perhaps at some neighbor's you know

167
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,380
house you're like oh man I got to get

168
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,960
home actually we talk about this all the

169
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,419
time with security and Disaster Recovery

170
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,699
test your Solutions if you're not

171
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,699
testing them are you really protected

172
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,000
being unprepared for bad situations has

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,979
real consequences we were just talking

174
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,020
about cars and the consequences were

175
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,539
escalating in those examples but let's

176
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,840
talk about worse consequences so I had a

177
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,580
friend this friend was in custody they

178
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,139
were arrested

179
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,940
and it's not a good place to be right

180
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,880
the system is cruel it is uncaring their

181
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,160
contact with others was very limited if

182
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,560
you don't know how to use prison phones

183
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,820
if you don't know how this works there's

184
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,740
a lot we're going to get into in this

185
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,440
talk about being incarcerated and you

186
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,340
know they were trying to reach out

187
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,500
eventually we got loved ones and people

188
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,940
in touch like hey where where is that

189
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,380
person they didn't make their flight and

190
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,880
somebody calls somebody and they get one

191
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
phone call out and we finally oh crap

192
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,600
so-and-so is incarcerated we got it we

193
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,820
gotta we got to deal with this and no

194
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,860
one really had a plan Like You Get

195
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,360
Enough smart people together you can

196
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,039
figure out okay well I guess need a

197
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,900
lawyer so call a lawyer but everyone was

198
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,460
shooting from the hip

199
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,199
and that lawyer we first got involved

200
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,720
like they kind of sucked and it was it

201
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,580
was not great they're they're kind of do

202
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,840
something and they weren't communicating

203
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,060
well and meanwhile the rest of us are

204
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,160
figuring out how things like bail Works

205
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
while trying to pull out money and fill

206
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,240
out paperwork eventually got them out on

207
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,100
pre-trial release and then you're like

208
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,419
all right well what do we freaking do

209
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,039
now and the lawyer is like well I don't

210
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,180
know what to do if we got a new lawyer

211
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,220
thank goodness but they're like okay

212
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,620
well the venue is many states away all

213
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,940
right well okay what do we do then do

214
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
they take us there like no they don't

215
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,699
take you they don't help you at all the

216
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,380
system sucks you got to get yourself

217
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,300
there we're like well how did they have

218
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,800
his passport they have his wallet like

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
how do you figure it out

220
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,580
learning how travel Works learning how

221
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,800
hotel stays worked checking into a hotel

222
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
when you have no ID and no money like a

223
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,060
network of people was there to support

224
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,520
this human but the real crazy thing was

225
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
the digital side they were finally

226
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,660
breathing free air momentarily pre-trial

227
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,099
trying to get their life put together

228
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,259
and actually get in touch with family

229
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,780
bosses Etc and they couldn't log into

230
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,620
anything

231
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,259
because they had MFA turned on right so

232
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,880
where's their MFA token all right well

233
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
they need their phone where's their

234
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
phone it's in a drawer somewhere in

235
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,800
evidence

236
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,020
and like what is it actually so okay no

237
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,220
you you were allowed to get that out of

238
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,539
evidence well now he's multiple states

239
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,819
away so they called the old lawyer who

240
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,919
sucks and that lawyer was able to like

241
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,319
get the phone and then what like fed

242
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,720
exit no we needed to get in right away

243
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,460
so the person literally is on an

244
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,620
unsecured line talking to this bad

245
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,199
lawyer saying here's how you unlock my

246
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,720
phone and I need you to go into my my

247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,460
multi-factor and like rattling off

248
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,620
multi-factor codes on a terrible phone

249
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,380
like while you're like charged with many

250
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,080
bad things like none of that is ideal

251
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
and it's all because things weren't

252
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,740
planned in advance the way we're going

253
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,120
to talk about here

254
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,819
now that eventually was a matter where I

255
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,620
think the good side prevailed and

256
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,060
everything worked out as best it could

257
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,819
but it was at extreme cost and extreme

258
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,240
stress so the idea of this talk

259
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,500
lawyer

260
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,399
passport locksmith gun I've had this

261
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,039
cooking for a while and the notion is

262
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,159
these are not exotic things right these

263
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,240
are things that I mean they're the

264
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,979
Yellow Pages right people talk about and

265
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,719
use these all the time

266
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,060
but when you have a need for one you're

267
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,640
like oh bro I need a lawyer or like oh

268
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,860
man I need a locksmith right now there's

269
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,839
urgency afoot there's usually like

270
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,160
critical thinking skills have kind of

271
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,420
gone out the window

272
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,800
so the takeaway is the best time to get

273
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,580
a lawyer or a passport or a locksmith or

274
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,480
a gun is before you need that lawyer

275
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,899
that passport that locksmith or that gun

276
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,760
and we're going to walk through all of

277
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
these categories and a lot of real world

278
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,300
examples and and some facts and some

279
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,360
resources to hopefully help you all out

280
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,940
so lawyers we'll start with lawyers my

281
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,680
wife and I have at least 10 lawyers

282
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,839
between us and that's you know because

283
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,160
we're of a certain age we're business

284
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,899
owners this may not all apply to you but

285
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,519
like we have business lawyers for

286
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,380
reviewing contracts and ndas and all

287
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
that jam

288
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,380
um we have a criminal defense lawyer

289
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
heaven forbid we're ever jammed up on

290
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,519
something and you will have brushes with

291
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,019
the law if you live long enough most

292
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,240
Citizen Law interactions tend to be

293
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
roadside traffic involved uh maybe

294
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,140
you're you know not not quite a Utah

295
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,640
thing but maybe you're coming home from

296
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,680
a bar and like oh did you did you not

297
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,060
the walk-in turn well we're going to

298
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,440
book you what we think it's a suspected

299
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,140
DUI like you might be facing it might be

300
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,839
bogus do you have a lawyer to call we do

301
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,120
I had a problem with the TSA they didn't

302
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,860
like how my gun was packed in my luggage

303
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,019
one time and you know they kind of they

304
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,339
they fussed about and they called the

305
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,660
police and they talked to okay and they

306
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,820
put me on the plane but seven months

307
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,440
later I got a letter in the mail

308
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,019
said Mr so and so your this was uh in

309
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,820
the incident you had at this airport you

310
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,800
have been found to violate this some FAA

311
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,540
please check the box do you accept

312
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
dispute pay the fine forget about it and

313
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,680
I was like well the fines a few hundred

314
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,060
bucks I could just pay it and forget it

315
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,860
but this is not like a bridge toll I'm

316
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,500
not signing anything involving gun laws

317
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,959
until I run it by a lawyer and I did and

318
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,279
he was like you should probably run this

319
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,560
by a Firearms lawyer so I do that too I

320
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,300
have just specialized firearm lawyers

321
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,519
for regular things for NFA things that I

322
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,279
own my wife has special practice lawyers

323
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,040
for her consulting firm they get really

324
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,200
into the cfaa and they want to make sure

325
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,940
that they are not going to find you know

326
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,399
people bashing down the office door

327
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,920
estate planning we're going to talk a

328
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,000
little bit about this we're going to

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,620
talk about things like Powers of

330
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,720
Attorney and wills this is something

331
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
that it's it used to not be fashionable

332
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,140
to do it's like oh we don't talk about

333
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,720
death and dying it became more

334
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,100
acceptable to talk about Advanced

335
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,380
directives and medical planning you go

336
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,300
through a lawyer for that

337
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,680
let's say you got to go on the offense

338
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,660
right we've had people in our world

339
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,339
we've had stalkers we've had unseemly

340
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,660
people on occasion we've had people

341
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,459
who've had to collect a debt from or

342
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,800
something we've got lawyers for that

343
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,480
we'll talk about immigration law later

344
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,540
in the passport section it will come up

345
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,300
and there's again I have someone on just

346
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,279
I am represented by and I have brought

347
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,019
them in on certain cases you will learn

348
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,040
about

349
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,720
civil rights in particular for

350
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,100
underrepresented minorities and

351
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,779
vulnerable populations lawyers who

352
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,060
understand what certain people are going

353
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,160
through that is different we will talk

354
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,360
about the need for that and if that

355
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,680
applies to you knowing the right person

356
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,180
to call and we also have one more

357
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,519
special lawyer so I'll talk about that

358
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,560
towards the very end

359
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,540
but yeah this this is lawyers we have

360
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,339
actual attorney-client relationships

361
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,079
with we're not paying them all monthly

362
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,519
right we paid a retainer here or

363
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,620
contract there this is in addition to

364
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,820
all the other lawyers I can make jokes

365
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,140
about like I'm friends but lock picking

366
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,459
lawyer I could call James Reeves the

367
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,320
Firearms lawyer he's my buddy all of my

368
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,940
friends at eff like half my friends are

369
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,160
lawyers that's why I drink so much

370
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,779
but all right let's let's get to the

371
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,459
worst case scenario for you as I said

372
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,560
most of most of the time in your life

373
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
the worst place you're probably ever

374
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,279
thinking about ending up is in handcuffs

375
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,380
right and not in the fun way

376
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,000
um has anyone in this room ever been

377
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
arrested willing to admit right has

378
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,200
anyone ever been detained but not

379
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,459
arrested

380
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,899
a little more hands there I've never

381
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,459
been my wife's been arrested Tara's been

382
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,740
arrested I've been detained uh I was in

383
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,480
San Francisco Airport I was asking too

384
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
many questions about the firearm

385
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,779
check-in process so I was officially

386
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,140
detained for 15 minutes by sfpd uh so

387
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,220
you know you get a little paperwork for

388
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,600
it now that's that's a very brief

389
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,899
interaction many of my friends a very

390
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,760
non-zero number of my friends have

391
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
experienced far far worse in terms of

392
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,279
detention and the system no matter how

393
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,980
brief your interaction with it is cruel

394
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,920
and it is callous and it is inhumane and

395
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
we will revisit this theme many of you I

396
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,820
believe with those very few hands have

397
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,180
not seen the inside of the coldest worst

398
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,800
places that we create in our society

399
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,519
they are horrible and minimizing your

400
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,019
exposure to that and your loved one's

401
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,120
exposure to that is something to talk

402
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
about

403
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,940
there are great resources out there

404
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,120
right flex your rights it's a 501c3 uh

405
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,980
it's all about educating the public

406
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,320
about you know just regular Citizen

407
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,060
Police interaction they have terrific

408
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,399
videos one the old one called busted is

409
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,560
still valid to this day uh they're newer

410
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,880
ones their production values have gone

411
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,740
up but check these out right Stephen

412
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,240
Silverman the whole group are doing a

413
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,459
great job they're easily watchable they

414
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,560
will give you a tool kit of language

415
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
that you use in terms of no thank you

416
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm not discussing my day no I don't

417
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,700
consent to any searches and learning how

418
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,279
to Workshop it watching along with these

419
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,220
really cool like acted out scenarios it

420
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,320
gives you something to try to invoke and

421
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,420
try to remember how to stand up and say

422
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,980
no excuse me I don't consent to any

423
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,139
searches if you're just pressed for time

424
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,160
you don't want to watch the long one

425
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,899
who's who's seen shut the [ __ ] up Friday

426
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,620
right it's a great clip yes you shut the

427
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,139
f up and you ask for an attorney now

428
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,839
this is not like you've seen on TV

429
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,639
if you really want to dig into it like

430
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,860
you can just take a Crim Pro class uh

431
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,480
Professor Joshua Dressler his criminal

432
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,519
procedures class it's available in audio

433
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,160
form I'm not a law student I loved it

434
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,899
it's just it was old cassettes that I

435
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,000
ripped I have the mp3s and it's all

436
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
about what the police are and aren't

437
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,839
allowed to do and what searches are and

438
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,680
aren't permitted in different

439
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,260
circumstances it's fascinating knowledge

440
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,180
so let's say you're actually hip to this

441
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,680
let's say you watch Law and Order you

442
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,720
know I want my attorney right how do you

443
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,160
get a lawyer

444
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,199
movies and TV give you a wildly

445
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,779
misleading idea about how this works you

446
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,000
may be in a holding cell for hours and

447
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,459
hours you may have to say I don't

448
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,019
consent to any searches I'm not

449
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,699
answering any questions I would like my

450
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,779
attorney dozens and dozens of times you

451
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,220
think it's bad like trying to buy a car

452
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,839
and like one car salesman leaves and

453
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,459
switches you to someone else you will

454
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,680
get this you will get different officers

455
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
and different DA's coming in and out

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,100
trying to say so just I just want to

457
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,779
explain what's going on here and say I'm

458
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,820
not making any statements I'm invoking

459
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,680
my right to counsel if they have a

460
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,820
little notepad they say well just tell

461
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,199
us what happened literally write down

462
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,500
say what time is it it's 10 40 10 45 I

463
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,060
am not making any statements I'm

464
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,399
invoking my right to counsel and you

465
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,540
hand it to them and it's written down

466
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,459
and you'll still just be thrown back in

467
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,779
a Cell for a while

468
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,820
let's say they do give you a phone call

469
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,100
do you even know where you are did they

470
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,420
tell you what institution you were taken

471
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,920
to try to get that information before

472
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,660
you pick up the phone they'll be very

473
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,459
helpful to let you call somebody but

474
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,079
then they clam up and they're full of no

475
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,579
information they're as unhelpful as a

476
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:42,779
stock boy in a grocery store when you

477
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,459
ask what building am I actually in right

478
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,420
now

479
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,060
you may be held for ages your phone may

480
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,279
be dead you might have a good number

481
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,600
that you want to call and it's in your

482
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
phone right

483
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
but let's let's another good question

484
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,300
how many people even remember phone

485
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,680
numbers these days

486
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,139
I get there's way too many hands I maybe

487
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,639
you're awesome I don't

488
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,940
I remember my wife's phone number my own

489
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,620
phone number which isn't helpful in this

490
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,300
matter and the phone number of the house

491
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,740
where I grew up where no one lives

492
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,000
anymore

493
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
everything else has gone down the drain

494
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,199
with most of my brain cells

495
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,660
if you're in custody and heaven forbid

496

498
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,560
call my lawyer their numbers in my phone

499
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,420

500
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,740
phone right

501
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,839

508
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:42,959
across the room

509
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360

513
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,060

514
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,000

516
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,820
phone number is in the phone I strongly

517
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,799
recommend you make a little card and

518
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,419
keep it in your phone case in your

519
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,299
wallet again if if you were being maybe

520
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,859
you're in a public action at a protest

521
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,179
or something you may be very badly

522
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,040
mistreated you may have your devices

523
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,859
taken smashed plenty of this your

524
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,900
devices may be destroyed but if you have

525
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,939
the phone number in hard copy you can

526
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,079
make your phone call

527
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,819
or if you really expect to be arrested

528
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,839

529
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,160

530
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,020
territory on your arm and Sharpie it's a

531
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,520
very common thing to do

532
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,020
now what if you're on the other end of

533
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,360
that phone call right what if a loved

534
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,179
one calls you from police custody

535
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,860
what are you going to do have you ever

536
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,059
drilled it

537
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,559
have you ever actually practiced this

538
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
call because they're not going to be

539
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
thinking very clearly they're going to

540
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
be very stressed and upset it is

541
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,960
incumbent on you to say I love you how

542
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
are you before you even say that the

543
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
first thing is did you shut the f up

544
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,600
don't tell me why you're there don't

545
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,160
tell me what's happening I don't need to

546
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,320
know you are if you're the loved one

547
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,640
getting a phone call you are the fire

548
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,260
department at that point you only need

549
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,940
to know two things

550
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,220
where's the problem and I gotta get out

551
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,480
the door

552
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,299
that's it your job is to show support by

553
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,220
getting the problem addressed not by

554
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,020
talking people you are always being

555
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,400
listened to if you're not aware of this

556
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,260
there have been people and I've known

557
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,299
them who have started to Spill the Beans

558
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,860
I wasn't even there and it was you know

559
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,720
Susan and then Susan gave the thing to

560
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,419
Bob no that is not the time for that

561
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,760
your job if the loved one is is calling

562
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,640
you is to say I got this people are on

563
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,799
the outside working for you you do not

564
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,200
make any statements counsel is involved

565
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
and then you put the rest of the plan

566
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,760
into action we'll talk about

567
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,900
but that's a little heavy there we're

568
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,280
going to talk about things that are

569
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,539
different than that that's we'll come

570
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,280
back to lawyer in a little bit lawyers

571
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,080
kind of the the heaviest one especially

572
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,340
because if there's some things in my

573
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,440
life recently

574
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360

575
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160

576
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,900

584
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,720
um I'm curious

585
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,220
keep those hands up if you have two

586
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,380
passports

587
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,000
there's a few hands

588
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,660
two valid passwords anybody have three

589
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,160
and start going down it's really hard to

590
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,919
see it does anyone have more than three

591
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,740

594
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
they don't have to all be from other

595
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,480
countries you can have multiple U.S

596
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,860
passports

597
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,840
this is my buddy AST these are three of

598
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,400
his passports

599
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,620
yeah yeah anybody got a black passport

600
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,360
you live in that black passport life

601
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,740
that diplomatic life

602
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,059
you know get out of trouble in all the

603
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,340
foreign countries it's not true

604
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,720
Everyone likes to say that oh I could

605
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
get in a bar fight in Amsterdam no it

606
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,660
just means you're not explaining

607
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,919
yourself to the local cops you're

608
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,120
explaining yourself to the Ambassador

609
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,620
and they don't take bribes nearly as

610
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,960
well as local cops so that's the whole

611
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,280
thing anybody live in the maroon

612
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
passport deal that's I'd be shocked if

613
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,539
anyone has a maroon passport they are

614
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,460
super rare and it means you do spooky

615
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,799
stuff with like the DIA and some [ __ ]

616
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,900
no this is AST uh this is his full

617
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,520
collection these are all valid passports

618
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
at the same time but that's because he

619
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,660
does you know spooky things

620
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,160
um he has triple citizenship he does

621
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,140
government work we'll talk about things

622
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,580
that are a little bit more achievable in

623
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,660
this room

624
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,160
starting with

625
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,380
having a passport that first question

626
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,120
when I said who doesn't have a passport

627
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
I try not to be super prescriptive I

628
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,919
don't like to say absolutes in this

629
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,240
world and a lot of things this is pretty

630
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,059
much an absolute everyone should have a

631
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,660
passport almost no exception to this and

632
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,460
there's there's travel is a good thing

633
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,539
right you could it's one of the few

634
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,919
things you can spend money on and come

635
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,380
away wealthier but there are actual

636
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,360
things that will arise in your life like

637
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
why are passports so critical they might

638
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,020
be for jobs

639
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,240
my wife regularly puts a lot of effort

640
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,919
into bringing women and people of color

641
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,200
up to stages all around the world at

642
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,340
different events where she works with

643
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,220
governments igos ngos who would like a

644
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,960
free trip to Paris right do you want to

645
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,700
turn that down because she's like hey

646
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,780
that project you were working on it

647
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,799
would be great we've got to have bring

648
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,720
you to the OCD and talk about that and

649
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,919
you're like well I don't actually have a

650
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,260
passport no be ready with that right

651
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,120
what if I hit the lottery and I take

652
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,980

653
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,419

654
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,160

opportunities come and like bang you

657
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
have to be ready but there's not a lot

658
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,360
of urgency there let's get a little more

659
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,140
urgent

660
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,179
what if you lose your primary care I

661
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,740
hate the stock value who's a so dumb

662
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,820
enough person to like leave their old

663
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,679
wallet I hate stock footage but you know

664
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,880
let's say you don't just lose your whole

665
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,980
wallet let's say you lose your ID your

666
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,440
your ID card your license uh it's not

667
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,059
uncommon frankly in a lot of firearm

668
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,740
spaces if you're renting a gun you give

669
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,299
them your license okay and maybe you

670
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,500
forgot it there

671
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,659
and you all go home from this trip and

672
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,980
it was real fun and I was cool we shot

673
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,720
the machine guns oh shoot I forgot my

674
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,820
license it's back at the gun range it's

675
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,559
actually really hard to kind of like do

676
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,480
normal life things if you're missing an

677
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,520
ID and it's your only ID you can't

678
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
really Drive legally you can't check

679
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,780
into hotels you can't get on planes that

680
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,480
having a spare ID in the form of a

681
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,520
passport in a drawer somewhere that's

682
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,100
useful even domestically

683
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,200
a little more and getting your ID back

684
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,720
under real ID they're going to ask for

685
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,919
like do you have a passport a birth

686
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,840
certificate Etc getting your just your

687
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,820
driver's license back it's very helpful

688
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,799
if you have maybe a passport with you

689
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,840
it's a good thing to have

690
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,000
but let's get any more urgency maybe you

691
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,559
have a loved one who has a terrible

692
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,960
situation overseas maybe it's a medical

693
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
emergency maybe it's something you know

694
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,400
super Shady with like you know some

695
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,080

696
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,400
of a crime

697
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
and you've got to get on the horn with

698
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,580
you and the Citizen Services Unit by the

699
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,440

00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,640
world if someone has an emergency of any

712
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,500
kind is critical

713
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,480
there are ways you can get an emergency

714
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,000
passport from the state department they

715
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,799
all involve medical urgency they involve

716
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,900
a direct relative so it has to be blood

717
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,480
family or a spouse which maybe it's not

718
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
that for you they also have to be like

719
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,039
dead or dying someone in hospice someone

720
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,200
who has just expired or is in incredible

721
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,179
grave life-threatening situation if

722
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,919
someone's just you know locked up on

723
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,900
some weird charge and they're not your

724
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,299
spouse or your mom State Department's

725
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,919
going to say yeah that sure sucks here's

726
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,240
the phone call for Citizen Services Unit

727
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,220
we'll see what we can do having a

728
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,200
passport is something that can get you

729
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
over there to just help manage the

730
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,460
situation on the ground

731
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,860
maybe you're fleeing a threat I have

732
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,020
friends who have had to flee their homes

733
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,820
they've been swatted they've been

734
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,080
targeted they've been taught by fash

735
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,940
like they didn't have time to freak

736
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,500
around and like deal with paperwork and

737
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,600
wait three days for a passport they had

738
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,340
to be gone

739
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,280
having a passport is really important in

740
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,140
a lot of lives

741
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,820
so I've talked about multiple passports

742
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,320
at the start though how is that like

743
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,640
possible what's up with multiple

744
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,620
passports those of you who have won

745
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,360
maybe want to start living a bigger

746
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,280
bigger accessibility different parts of

747
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,059
the world

748
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,179
for a lot of people 2016 was a catalyst

749
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,520
a lot of people I know personally who

750
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,860
have felt really unsafe the rise of

751
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,840
fascism has been on its way for a while

752
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,580
now since then and we're not out of the

753
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,140
woods yet with this last election it

754
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,700
just kind of Pumped the break slightly

755
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,500
on that there are still real real risks

756
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,240
for a lot of populations who are

757
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,220
targeted in this country and I've been I

758
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,900
know people who are like man I wonder if

759
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,640
I could get dual citizenship

760
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,340
you really can uh a lot of us are

761
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,840
pursuing it and have been for a while

762
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,820
it's kind of like the old adage like

763
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,220
like in the movie Casablanca right the

764
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,720
time to think about how to flee your

765
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,600
country is before you have to flee your

766
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
country so do the paperwork if you're

767
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
interested there are a lot of Nations

768
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,320
that you might not believe have a

769
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,360
pathway for you to get citizenship full

770
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,340
passport and on there are a lot of

771
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,260
Nations typically that have had a large

772
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,720
diaspora over the years to America

773
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,419
so take Ireland great example Ireland do

774
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,440
you know during the Potato Famine

775
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,380
Ireland lost most of its population not

776
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,360
to just death but like most people just

777
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,120
left and they went to at the U.S Canada

778
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,640
other places the world there are tons of

779
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,140
people who has Irish ancestry in this

780
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,980
room

781
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,419
there's a lot of us

782
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,419
so if you have Irish lineage if you have

783
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,700
Portuguese lineage Italian lineage if

784
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
you have the right chain of relatives

785
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,159
you can apply for dual citizenship and

786
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,960
it's a good deal for you and for the

787
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,940
country because it costs like it could

788
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,620
use paperwork here and a lawyer here and

789
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,080
Court filing fees these European nations

790
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,539
know the only people who are going to

791
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,700
try to do this are people with

792
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,919
professional careers some discretionary

793
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,980
income and they want to reclaim you as

794
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,900
part of their tax revenue as part of

795
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,000
their value to their economy they want

796
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,620
you to come over and they want you to

797
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,700
live there a little while maybe you'll

798
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,799
buy a little property it makes sense for

799
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,679
them to want to reclaim this diaspora of

800
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,620
learned you know minds they will have a

801
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,480
path forward and some of them really

802
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,480
make it open doors in terms of like

803
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,640
let's say for I speak I can speak to

804
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,039
Italy I know the Italy process very well

805
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,320
you have to have a great grandparent or

806
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,539
better who was Italian

807
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,400
well maybe you didn't maybe oh shoot him

808
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
it's like great great so and so and now

809
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,039
they're all dead

810
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,260
you can do the paperwork

811
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,600
to pay the money and have the dead ones

812
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,520
posthumously

813
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,799
declared Italian citizens even if they

814
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
were living in America and then hey

815
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,740
guess what you got a great grandparent

816
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,559
who's Italian do the process for you

817
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,000
yeah

818
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,340

831
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,880
tree and you get 18 different spellings

832
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,520
of one name try to clean that up get it

833
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,919
get it the actual details and then when

834
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,200
you get the time start reaching out to

835
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,000
the Department of Vital Statistics or

836
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,860
the Departments of health or old funeral

837
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,779
homes you're going to have to get birth

838
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,880
certificates death certificates you're

839
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,500
going to get your own paperwork while

840
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,720
you're at it I recommend getting if you

841
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,059
don't have a certified copy of your

842
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,340
birth certificate do it just get a few

843
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,320
these are just PDFs that you download

844
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,179
from this department or that department

845
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,159
and then you got to fill it out and send

846
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,659
in your check or money order for like 17

847
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,159
bucks and then you wait for it to come

848
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,919
back it takes a lot of time but it's not

849
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,679
a lot of work the work is done by an

850
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:47,520
attorney

851
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
you will get an immigration attorney

852
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,720
please make sure they speak both your

853
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,159
language and the nation's language where

854
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,960
you're going fluently we've had some

855
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,179
hiccups with some friends there but they

856
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,320
will just push things through the court

857
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,120
just let it wind through the court very

858
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,600
slowly and make no mistake there's a

859
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,799
cost involved

860
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
you are going to basically buy a decent

861
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,860
used car and drive it into a lake

862
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,900
you're just gonna say goodbye to like

863
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,580
five six thousand dollars at the end of

864
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,020
this that's on the low end depending on

865
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,919
country

866
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,080
but to have that to be able to

867
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,520
understand that you can then have the

868
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,260
freedom to travel and all it costs you

869
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,940
was learning about notaries and

870
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
apostills apostille's like a notary on

871
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,720
steroids these are these are terms

872
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,520
you're going to learn as soon with how

873
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
documents are accepted in international

874
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
courts I've learned all of this in the

875
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,620
process just by doing a little reading

876
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,659
printing a few PDFs sending some

877
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,820
envelopes out six seven months later the

878
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,140
lawyer's like oh yeah by the way we got

879
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,279
that thing back from the court here's

880
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,380
the next step they tell you what to do

881
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,000
it's not that hard

882
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,039
if you are thinking of any kind of name

883
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,260
change or gender marker change

884
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,059
do that now because you want everything

885
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,279
to match as the paperwork winds through

886
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,900
the system I'm not really going to

887
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,340
assume that like Italy is going to

888
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,900
understand a gender marker change not

889
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,400
with the facts they just voted in

890
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
speaking of gender markers if you if

891
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
you're considering an X gender marker

892
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,500
foreign countries may not understand

893
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,260
what that is talk to your lawyer before

894
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,760
you decide to do that here it could have

895
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,500
implications

896
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,200
but the end result is incredible Freedom

897
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,140
it is an emergency exit if where you are

898
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
turns bad and it gives you the freedom

899
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,760
to live and work all the tax problems of

900
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,380
like working in other countries and are

901
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,640
you allowed to work for six months and

902
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,260
not six months all that goes away with a

903
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,539
foreign passport there's rankings of

904
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,760
like what passports are best don't put

905
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,380
too much into that and don't dwell too

906
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,240
much on that you can see like the

907
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,500
American passport gets you to these

908
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,820
countries but not those countries and

909
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,679
the Singaporean passport has you know

910
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,440
more the the power rank really again

911
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,419
like the top one is the UAE

912
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,039
it doesn't mean you can go everywhere

913
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,600
you can't even come to the US without a

914
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,059
Visa power rank just kind of entails

915
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,520
what regimes some countries are willing

916
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,799
to deal with uh because if you trade a

917
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,539
lot of guns and oil like sure you can go

918
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,279
to a lot of authoritarian countries but

919
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,200
honestly the European the European

920
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,539
passports are the hot ones and a lot of

921
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,820
you a lot of you might have a pathway

922
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,760
forward on that that you never knew and

923
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,919
if this interests you I encourage you to

924
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,299
look into it it might be something

925
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,220
that's really really achievable

926
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,899
there are crazy loopholes like if you're

927
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,820
British if you're from the UK do you

928
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,380
know you can surrender your citizenship

929
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,419
to do another citizenship and then get

930
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,399
it back but you can only do it once it's

931
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,440
like blowing an e-fuse on a circuit it's

932
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,760
like here's your one shot hope you got

933
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,620
that update in all right go

934
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,659
uh maybe you don't have a past maybe you

935
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,220
have no family you don't even a real

936
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,600
name you just you I don't have any

937
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,820
citizenship elsewhere I'm just some guy

938
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,440
from America forever

939
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,659
I mean it is true you can just kind of

940
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,940
buy citizenship right like St Lucia

941
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,380
forty thousand dollars overseas

942
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,419
investment now is it the most powerful

943
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,740
passport on that rank not the most

944
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,260
powerful but some people they're like I

945
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,100
don't want to go through all the trouble

946
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,840
of this I'm just going to drop coin on

947
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,720
that maybe you can just drop half a mill

948
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,700
live in Amsterdam for five years you can

949
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,100
become Dutch Portugal's the hot one now

950
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,020
for a lot of business owners a lot of

951
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,240
tech company business owners I know they

952
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,799
are doing foreign investment if you have

953
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,840
fluency you learn the language you do

954
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
far far in business investment you get

955
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
portugue citizenship get that EU

956
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,760
passport

957
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,320
let's say none of that appeals to you

958
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,700
but you still kind of thought it was

959
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,260
cool when you saw someone with multiple

960
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,399
passports

961
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,279
you can get a second U.S passport

962
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,320
two valid US passports at the same time

963
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,059
absolutely possible

964
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,039
you can Google this Google applying for

965
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,039
a second passport book sometimes this is

966
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,600
because you have to travel to multiple

967
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,580
places that do not like each other

968
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,380
if you have to fly into Ben Gurion

969
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,120
Airport and land in Tel Aviv they don't

970
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,799
want to see stamps and Visa stamps in it

971
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,539
from like a bunch of other Arab Nations

972
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,580
if you have to go to the UAE or Dubai

973
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,020
like you know like I'm going to find a

974
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,580
Dubai they better not see an Israeli

975
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,919
passport stamp so you can maintain you

976
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,059
can talk to the state department and say

977
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,100
I've got this travel if you just do a

978
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,360
ton of travel if you work for a

979
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,039
multinational you show the state

980
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,179
department like look at my travel

981
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,520
history look at all these visas I

982
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,960
constantly am sending my passport away

983
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
to get a Visa they're like all right you

984
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,320
can just get a second one

985
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,419
that last one sending your passport away

986
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,880
to get a Visa this is the other even if

987
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,860
you don't do a ton of travel this is

988
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,000
something you can do

989
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,159
so if you're traveling on that big map

990
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,899
like some countries need a visa you

991
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,460
don't do that when you land I mean some

992
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,020
places you do but most of the time if

993
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,120
you want to go to China you have to tell

994
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,100
China hi I am not Chinese I would like

995
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,659

996
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,340

998
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,200

1001
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,899
this is not fast it takes a little while

1002
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,419
that's why passport expediters exist a

1003
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,980

1004

just pay people under the table but what

1006
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,260
you do is if you're going to China or

1007

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,839
if you've seen his videos like the

1143
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,480
master 5400 series all of these style of

1144
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,520
lock boxes even the Clones they are

1145
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,680
terrible you can watch him rip through

1146
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,359
all of them and decode them on all of

1147
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,640
his videos uh do not do not do not use

1148
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
that as a lock box for your spare key

1149
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,780
the one I actually like is made by Supra

1150
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,839
the Supra c500 I haven't found a way

1151
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,060
personally to destroy it uh LPL if

1152
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,800
you're watching uh do a video about this

1153
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,780
make me cry and look wrong at this but

1154
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,000
uh yeah maybe maybe that's one way to

1155
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,619
keep your key outside

1156
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,300
Automotive is a fun one by the way

1157
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,040
here's something for everybody out there

1158
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,200
who has one or two big vehicle keys

1159
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,700
especially if they're chipped keys or

1160
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,560
transponder keys

1161
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
go ahead and if you want get a spare key

1162
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,220
because if you don't have a spare key

1163
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,599
you don't go to the dealer you go to

1164
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,980
locksmith they can do the exact same

1165
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,000
thing it's not going to void your

1166
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,740
warranty it's going to cost you way less

1167
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,300
but get one more car key cut on bare

1168
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,740
metal

1169
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,839
no chip no transponder

1170
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,540
that's the key that you go under your

1171
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,640
vehicle's frame look for a hole and zip

1172
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,380
tie it to the frame of your truck or

1173
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,400
your car

1174
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,640
because if you're locked out of your car

1175
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,320
you probably were driving it you're

1176
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,700
either in front of your house and you're

1177
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,099
like oh I left my keys inside or you

1178
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,480
were like loading groceries at Target

1179
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,640
and the wind blew and the doors like oh

1180
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,160
damn it and your key your keys are

1181
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,140
probably right in the car if you're

1182
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,760
stuck outside the car

1183
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,980
a metal key like that with no chip

1184
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,920
that'll open the door that key does not

1185
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,200
help anyone steal your car even if some

1186
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,240
master Thief was like under your car I

1187
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,920
was like oh a key what are they going to

1188
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,940
do they're going to open a door and then

1189
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,320
they can't start the car

1190
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,180
if someone wants to get in your door by

1191
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,680
the way they're not crawling under your

1192
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,940
car right if you have something on your

1193
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,780
back seat they're just going to break

1194

the window this key under your car

1195

until the day you need it

1211

1218
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,060

1219
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,980

1220
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,020

1221
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,400

1222
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,920

1223
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,619

1225
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,820

1226
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,260
gun

1227
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,300
it's a touch of your subject I will try

1228
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,440
to be dispassionate I will probably fail

1229
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,359
um humans are bad at risk assessment in

1230
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,320
general the concept of like need a gun

1231
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,599
is wildly off base with reality for most

1232
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,940
people most of the people who feel the

1233
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,980
most threatened in this world are some

1234
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,020
of the safest in our society we saw this

1235
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,820
during the pandemic everyone was just

1236
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,859
staying at home you're not going out in

1237
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,240
the world meeting people but you got to

1238
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,380
have that gun in your home I guess all

1239
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,480
the gun purchases skyrocketed uh how

1240
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,740
many people saw that you know there was

1241
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,020
a bunch of you know young kids teenagers

1242
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,640
walking down the street to the mayor's

1243
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,920
house for a protest and the mccloskeys

1244
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,599
came storming out of their house with

1245
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,400
their guns because oh there were some

1246
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,980
black teenagers on their street I remain

1247
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,380
to this day

1248
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,480
amazed at the restraint showed by that

1249
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,660
crowd of kids

1250
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,700
not a single person drilled this Don

1251
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,800
wagon and with it with a round with a

1252
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,940
gun pointed right out that is

1253
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,640
unbelievable Poise and you can guarantee

1254
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,660
if it was a bunch of white people

1255
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,820
walking down the street

1256
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,320
the mccloskeys would have taken the room

1257
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,119
temperature challenge that day then

1258
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,440
again they wouldn't because if it was a

1259
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,400
bunch of white people walking down the

1260
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,240
street they wouldn't have come out of

1261
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,740
their house waving guns

1262
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,480
there are real we're not going to get

1263
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,280
super into this there are real risks out

1264
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,420
there in the world

1265
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,640
violent crime is going down but there

1266
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,700
are pockets of of real bad folk I and

1267
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,960
others in my friend group have been

1268
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,359
directly targeted by fash like not just

1269
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,460
with shitty tweets like I've had people

1270
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,380
who've had fascists driving up and down

1271
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,880
their streets knocking on their doors at

1272
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,680
night screaming at them in parking lots

1273
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,000

00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:20,760

remember they are not here to help you

1287
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,400
law enforcement does not exist to make

1288
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,200
you safe law enforcement exists to

1289
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,480
prosecute and gather evidence

1290
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,820
if you are part of the investigation you

1291
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,500
do not have anything to say your lawyer

1292
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,720
has something to say have a lawyer refer

1293
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,280
to lawyer

1294
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,260
and my wife and I didn't really feel at

1295
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,700

pretty well provisioned uh I'm

1297
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,300
fundamentally a very peaceful person I

1298
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,460
abhor violence quite frankly I don't

1299
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,660
really even like violent movies anymore

1300
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,760
that doesn't mean I don't own guns

1301
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,500
um we're very happy about the fact that

1302
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,820
our home is properly provisioned we're

1303
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,920
happy that friends of ours are properly

1304
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,420
provisioned and that the fashion know

1305
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,800
this and they generally leave most of my

1306
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,540
friends alone for that reason

1307
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,760
speaking of though this is a sneaky

1308
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,619
trick I hadn't seen before

1309
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,480
friend of mine named Chad

1310
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,760
activist well-known online

1311
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,339
he got targeted by a bunch of

1312
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,140
right-wingers and they did the following

1313
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,000
they engaged in kind of like that

1314
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,680
Scientology thing where you stand right

1315
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,060
in front of someone and make them bump

1316
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,859
into you and then they claimed assault

1317
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:33,180
because he was on a sidewalk like

1318
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,859
marching with a sign

1319
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,960
they filed a restraining order against

1320
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,820
they filed a complaint right they had a

1321
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,200
criminal matter opened up

1322
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,900
so then that means a few things one it

1323
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,280
means that he had to surrender all of

1324
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,079
his firearms because he had an open

1325
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,220
legal matter he had a potential

1326
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,920
restraining order it also involved the

1327
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,839
process server who was the friend and

1328
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,400
also one of the right Wingers went to

1329
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,040
his house and recorded while she was

1330
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,260
serving him serving him papers so trying

1331
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,579
because they wanted to post that on

1332
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,900
their blog or something to like make him

1333
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,720
look bad now in the process she recorded

1334
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,280
his home inside and out because his door

1335
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,619
was open which is a super No-No uh but

1336
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,000
what is what does Chad have in addition

1337
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,040
to Gunn his lawyers

1338
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
his lawyer is actually a man named Ken

1339
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,060
white do you know who Ken white is he's

1340
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,619
popat online

1341
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,359
so if you know who popat is you can

1342
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,040
guess how well this went for the people

1343
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,359
that made a false complaint against

1344
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,579
against Chad so he's finding out his

1345
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,839
guns back

1346
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,400
again I don't want to make you think

1347
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,560
that the world is horrible like violent

1348
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,079
crime is decreasing in this country uh

1349
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,119
there are pockets of very violent people

1350
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,460
that are increasing and they are out

1351
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,380
there and they are targeting very very

1352
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,359
specific groups of people and this part

1353
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,980
doesn't always address everyone in this

1354
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,040
room there are very very dear to me

1355
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,599
people in my life who are very

1356
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,280
specifically targeted anyone in the

1357
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,079
lgbtq community anyone who's

1358
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,819
underreparated minorities like they are

1359
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,220
the ones who are getting targeted and I

1360
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,780
love that like the world's awful but

1361
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,400
it's made for some great memes my

1362
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,900
friends and I who's got a love language

1363
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,000
of your friends just sending batshit

1364
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,500
memes to each other and laughing all the

1365
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,300
time like that is kind of how we all

1366
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,500
communicate

1367
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,780
but in addition to that my friends who

1368
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,460
have felt you know targeted by bad

1369
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,400
groups like I have taken loads of people

1370
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,800
to the gun range it is it is my pleasure

1371
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,140
to take a lot of queer and trans people

1372
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,819
to get their first time behind a trigger

1373
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,319
and get them interested and they say you

1374
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:20,640
know what this is all right I'm I'm

1375
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,200
going to be interested in this now but I

1376
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,400
don't even need to be the one doing that

1377
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,800
right underrepresented groups minority

1378
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,300
groups are more than capable of

1379
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,280
organizing on their own of finding their

1380
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,200
own Circles of making their own spaces

1381
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,540
it's really just a battle of finding

1382
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,800
good information

1383
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,260
uh the challenge of like getting good

1384
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,480
information in the gun world not from a

1385
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,119
crappy person my heart breaks for all of

1386
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,680
you all of my friends who are like queer

1387
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,060

1388
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,040
guntubers literally starts every one of

1389
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,960
his videos with a with a like a shitty

1390
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,300
slurp just just kind of minor gay

1391
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,680
bashing you know just just throw that in

1392
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,579

amazing diverse voices you don't have to

1418
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,640
get your gun information from people

1419
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,819

and before you go out and purchase a gun

1430
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,160

1431
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,900
gun talk I know I'm like the gun guy

1432

is so easy in America I mean do you

1434
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,420
really know have you actually done it

1435
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,700
have you not there's a lot of forms you

1436
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,560
might not be expecting I know that

1437
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,599
cannabis has become decriminalized in a

1438
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,400
lot of areas but you know right if

1439
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,800
you're filling out that form 4473 no

1440
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,119
you've never had cannabis you don't know

1441
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,200
what it is you've never seen it you

1442
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,520
never smelled it you heard about it once

1443
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,960
in a dare program when you were 12.

1444
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,480
you've forgotten about it since then

1445
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,700
different state laws like Washington has

1446
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,619
initiative 1639 it's just different

1447
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,660
paperwork do you have all your documents

1448
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,339
in order the documents I told you to

1449
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,079
start getting an order before think

1450
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,400
about that

1451
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,079
you want to be purchasing something when

1452
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,540
you're not already under stress if you

1453
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,280
are dealing like with a Violent X and

1454
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,599
you're getting stalker phone calls

1455
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,240
that's not the time to try to go out and

1456
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,520
be sensible and buy something that's not

1457
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,260
the time to go out and try something at

1458
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,240
the range go when you're not under

1459
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,579
stress go and times are relatively okay

1460
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,520
go with your friends I have taken loads

1461
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,200
of people I love trying their guns they

1462
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,079
love trying mine that is when you get

1463
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,819
yourself into the water and get your

1464
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,200
foot in the water if you've never done

1465
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,700
any firearm things

1466
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,700
but in general like if I'm saying a week

1467
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,319
or two you'll get that gun you'll deal

1468
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,880
with it is it really like why am I

1469
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,099
bringing a gun section into this

1470
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:25,079
there's a few other matters to talk

1471
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,040
about

1472
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,880
specifically getting a gun isn't the

1473
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,920
only thing that you're thinking about in

1474
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,900
gun this section a gun is not a magic

1475
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,140
Talisman that just makes everything fine

1476
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,880
all the gun people in this room no it

1477
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,800
means you have to be proficient with you

1478
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,180
have to be safe with it you have to

1479
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,760
actually go out and train a lot of my

1480
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,220
friends again these are all people in

1481
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,500
the queer space in the trans space these

1482
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,180
are people who don't just go up buy a

1483
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,859
gun and throw it in a drawer like

1484
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,839
Artemis Mia like they are going to do

1485
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,640
Dynamic drills movement drills shooting

1486
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,980
drills if you've never gone to do any

1487
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,800
practical shooting it's fun like this is

1488
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,660
an absolute hoot I didn't think I would

1489
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,579
ever be good at this kind of thing but

1490
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:07,319
learning how to do it going out to a

1491
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,540
match finding out how well you can run

1492
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,000
your firearm is absolutely something to

1493
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,839
try

1494
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,640
we had some sound but I guess uh we're

1495
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,619
not going to do tons of gum blah blah

1496
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,660
blah blah don't worry about that

1497
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,400
seriously how many how many people are

1498
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,900
gun owners in this room I'm just curious

1499
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,880
how have you ever gone out to a match

1500
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,859
and shot it on the clock actually done

1501
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,380
groups and splits consider it consider

1502
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,000
it the clock doesn't lie

1503
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,920
I could say like the movie Castaway was

1504
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,140
was cute and he survived but like even

1505
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,540
if a perfect fishing pole showed up on

1506
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,640
the beach and he was like starving when

1507
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,780
you're starving on a desert island

1508
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,339
that's not the best time to try to learn

1509
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:44,040
how to fish when you're under stress and

1510
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,839
like you're targeted for some stalker or

1511
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,220
something that's not the best time to

1512
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,859
try to learn how to like use a gun like

1513
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,380
please and also far far far more useful

1514
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,380
than guns are patching holes

1515
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,060
anybody who talks to you about gun stuff

1516
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,319
and doesn't talk to you about first aid

1517
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,060
and Care is not doing you justice so

1518
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,800
learn about again again my friend

1519
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,720
tactical girlfriend most of her videos

1520
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,300
are not all gun there's all about wound

1521
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,400
care there's about lead exposure just

1522
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,200
being safe and being prepared to treat

1523
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,880
people because again if you haven't

1524
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,819
learned how these use how these are used

1525
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:17,819
like talk about tourniquets

1526
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,380
who has ever applied a tourniquet to

1527
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,339
someone

1528
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,140
not a lot of hands who's ever had a

1529
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,940
tourniquet applied to themselves

1530
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,980
almost no hands

1531
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,480
hopefully it was during a training class

1532
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,339
like this is my leg getting a tourniquet

1533
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm not dealing with a horrible wound

1534
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,020
I'm learning about it I'm in a deployed

1535
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,940
medicine class and you can see that's

1536
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,099
this guy he's got a knee jammed right in

1537
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,420
my groin it's not because he's a jerk

1538
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,940
doesn't like me when you are applying a

1539
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,319
tourniquet to stop the bleed you are

1540
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,540
staunched down on that femoral artery it

1541
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,819
will cause pain the few people who tried

1542
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,160
tourniquets in the past how do they feel

1543
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
when they're on

1544
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,500
they're horrible horrible

1545
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,780
you are the first time I did this I was

1546
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,940
like you are doing this wrong what is

1547
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,040
happening I learned so much in these

1548
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,140
classes if I were to ever literally try

1549
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,460
to be saving someone with a severe

1550
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,260
Hemorrhage I would be telling them

1551
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,540
verbally assuring them I'm going to

1552
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,819
cause you more pain than you are in

1553
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:14,640
right now trust me this is keeping you

1554
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,099
alive you have to take it

1555
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,319
until you've had to tourniquet on you

1556
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,380
cannot fathom the excruciating pain in

1557
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,420
that limb I would have probably tried to

1558
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,040
rip it off if I was even in a critical

1559
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,079
Stitch like no this can't be right until

1560
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,200
I experienced it try it take an actual

1561
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,420
emergency medicine class learn this go

1562
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,339
to trainings

1563
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:36,839
get your medical training so then you

1564
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:37,859
can be that person at Thanksgiving

1565
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:39,180
dinner like who's like oh you should

1566
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,440
have a fire extinguisher in your house

1567
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,119
that person you can be that person to

1568
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,800
like you know traumatic wound care like

1569
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,240
do you have a good tourniquet is it

1570
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,920
truly a cat tourniquet did you pay for a

1571
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,200
fake one like totally but learn how this

1572
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,160
works

1573
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,420
how about quick question for the

1574
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,160
audience how long can a tourniquet stay

1575
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,020
on without causing harm to a limb

1576
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,619
I'm hearing something here an hour or

1577
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,319
two any other guesses

1578
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,720
45 minutes the answer is two hours

1579
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,960
two hours we have tons of data at this

1580
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,520
point now that everybody we deploy

1581
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,559
downrange in uniform they all have a TQ

1582
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,839
on them we have tons of military data at

1583
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:14,520
this point there is not a single

1584
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,040
occurrence from any Soldier sailor

1585
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,079
Airmen or Marine who's had a TQ applied

1586
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,300
for under two hours and the limb wasn't

1587
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,500
saved

1588
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,380
the body is fine with being cut off from

1589
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,660
like normal up like you sever a finger

1590
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,099
and all that shop Cloud oh you put it on

1591
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:30,359
ice and get to the hospital they

1592
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,160
reattach it like we know the body can do

1593
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,380
this but you get this really bad who's

1594
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,059
ever heard that boy scout crap like

1595
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,800
every 15 minutes you gotta ease it off

1596
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,880
and then put it on and then you fiddle

1597
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,920
but then spin around that's all nonsense

1598
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,559
two hours you can go up to six hours

1599
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,119
technically at which point

1600
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,500
somebody else is opening your pickle

1601
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,780
jars but yeah like two hours you're fine

1602
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,940
put it on leave it on get to a higher

1603
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,140
standard of care

1604
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,300
but training with real world tools and

1605
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,280
methods training with your firearms

1606
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,319
training with your aid kit this is

1607
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,420
something that I encourage people to do

1608
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,940
not because you want to be violent again

1609
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,099
I'm a fundamentally really peaceful

1610
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,240
person

1611
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,400
but I have firearms that's not a

1612
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,680
disconnect there's a really old adage

1613
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,059
and I know some of you have heard this

1614
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:14,819
if you do not have the means of violence

1615
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,680
you aren't peaceful

1616
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,400
you're harmless there's a difference

1617
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,440
now getting back into use of force we're

1618
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,660
going to segue to the last story I got

1619
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,619
for you

1620
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:28,140
and it's a doozy and at any point in

1621
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,520
this story

1622
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,440
go ahead and walk out I will not be

1623
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,319
upset at you this is a story that has to

1624
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,079
do with the penal system it has to do

1625
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,059
with gender-based violence it has to do

1626
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,300
with what is done in our name with our

1627
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,700
tax dollars and the steps you may have

1628
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,380
to take one day to move Heaven and Earth

1629
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,540
to save a loved one

1630
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,339
so this is one of my loved ones this is

1631

1633
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,540
an amazingly important person in my

1634
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,800
group of friends

1635
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,780
she's one of us she's a geek she's a

1636
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,880
cosplayer she's literally won awards for

1637
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,619
like incredible cosplay that she's done

1638
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:05,640
over the years

1639
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,380
uh back when she was in boy mode she's

1640
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,760
trans back when she was in boy mode she

1641
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,280
was a Navy corpsman right so she spent

1642
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,079
her time saving lives putting people

1643
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:14,099
back together

1644
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,079
and then she got herself taken apart

1645
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,240
pretty badly uh she got blasted up

1646
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,619
pretty good by an IED

1647
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,480
and ever since she's rotated back to the

1648
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,400
world she spent most of her civilian

1649
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,740
life in hospitals she's had traumatic

1650

brain injury multiple spinal surgeries

1651
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,660
she can't walk unassisted there's a lot

1652
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,680
wrong with her but it's hard to keep a

1653
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,059
good woman down right she serves her

1654
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,099
community every day and we all love her

1655
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:38,040
very much and we miss her because my

1656
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,660
friend Cara was arrested

1657
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,640
my friend Cara was arrested

1658
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,200
about a month ago a little over a month

1659
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,700
ago now and it's been a hell of a month

1660
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,339
she was arrested by federal authorities

1661
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,500
under her legal name

1662
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,720
she was taken to the courthouse she was

1663
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,300
arraigned under her legal name and you

1664
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,800
keep asking why is Steve keep saying

1665
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,000
under her legal name some of you know

1666
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,319
where this is going

1667
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,880
uh she was then taken to the Detention

1668
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,619
Center where she was booked under her

1669
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:02,520
dead name

1670
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,160
and thrown in the mail unit

1671
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,780
and I'm not going to subject you to

1672
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,420
specifics of that

1673
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,559
but we're all just going to sit with

1674
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,359
that for a minute

1675
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,280
because this happens all the time she's

1676
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,780
not even my first friend that's had this

1677
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,680
happen

1678
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,780
I had a friend back in my home City who

1679
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,359
was swept up in an arrest minor Tiki

1680
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,099
tack [ __ ] some some domestic you were in

1681
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:24,420
a fight with that person no that person

1682
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,280
said something so who knows what thrown

1683
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,359
in handcuffs in the middle of the night

1684
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,240
thrown in jail thrown in the mail pop

1685
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,920
spent the entire evening literally

1686
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,960
hiding under a blanket just with other

1687
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,520
prisoners like I'm coming for you baby

1688
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,440
I'm banging on the cells the worst

1689
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,940
experience you could ever imagine

1690
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,380
wondering what's going to happen when

1691
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,599
those cell doors open in the morning

1692
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,099
and what happened is that in the AM

1693
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,839
somebody came over and said yeah you're

1694
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,460
being released get out

1695
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,900
no explanation

1696
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,819
again I told you the system is cruel the

1697
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:53,460
system is indifferent and callous

1698
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,319
so they dumped her on a city street just

1699
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,960
some random Block in Seattle no shoes

1700
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,359
pajamas well I know shoes well because

1701
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,859
they take your shoelaces away shoelaces

1702
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,359
are a weapon but it takes time to unlace

1703
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,339
them so they'll just take your shoes Fu

1704
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:07,200
what are you gonna do about it they had

1705
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,400
never turned her phone off her phone had

1706
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,020
like one percent battery

1707
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,460
so she was able to call one person

1708
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,900
remember you might get one phone call

1709
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,520
maybe that's it and she had the

1710
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,500
wherewithal to say this is where I am

1711
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,420
please come get me

1712
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,420
but that was a one night stay no Cara

1713
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,619
was in for a week

1714
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,660
in the mail gen pop

1715
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,400
and it was hell

1716
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,079
she's getting phone privileges right

1717
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,099
what are you gonna do you're going to

1718
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:30,180
try to call somebody she calls her

1719
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,619
ex-wife still very good friends with her

1720
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:34,740
ex-wife who panics ex-wife calls me

1721
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,380
I panic because again I wasn't as

1722
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,599
prepared as I wanted to be this talk has

1723
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,339
been informed greatly by things I've

1724
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,359
learned

1725
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:44,040
first thing I did I just called the best

1726
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,240
lawyer I knew

1727
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,940
like Marsha I'm freaking out who do we

1728
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,859
know in New York and Marshall's like

1729
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:51,540
well Brian Klein is actually licensed to

1730
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,619
practice in New York he's there all the

1731
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:53,579
time you should try to call I was like

1732
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,680
bye call him Brian

1733
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,180
he's like damn I wish I had gotten word

1734
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,800
from you I'm literally on a plane I just

1735
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,540
left New York but I got a colleague hang

1736
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,920
on and let me connect you with so and so

1737
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,480
and we got somebody we actually

1738
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,640
literally got a person on the ground in

1739
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,720
short order

1740
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,280
and that's a miracle in and of itself

1741
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,680
now it turns out this person is

1742
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,960
amazingly competent at many types of law

1743
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,880
this person is a guy that's not his

1744
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,559
picture but he he looks like this guy

1745
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,500
he's he is not set up to deal with

1746
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,540
literally a disabled Navy veteran trans

1747
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,400
person being held in the wrong gen pop

1748
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,220
like he he that he was not suited to

1749
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,319
that this was not the right path so we

1750
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,640
got to figure something else out she's

1751
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,960
still again

1752
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,119
in the wrong unit being subject to

1753
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,460
abuses every day

1754
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,780
like all right got a call say call

1755

1756
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,720

1757
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,760
York who knows these issues Chelsea's

1758
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,740
like oh call Moira amazing human already

1759
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,000
dealing with the Bureau of Prisons and

1760
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,920
lawsuits I'm like thank God so now I got

1761
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,119
someone on the phone who's a civil

1762
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,220
rights lawyer who knows exactly who to

1763
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,619
call who knows what motions to file we

1764
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:54,540
get an actual other main lead counsel

1765
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,880
involved and we put together a team

1766
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,839
right

1767
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,940
this was the most stressful horrible

1768
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,280
time but once you get the right people

1769
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,720
in place people we could have had in

1770
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,000
place before if we just kind of over

1771
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,500
dinner and drinks ever thought about

1772
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,700
this sort of thing you never want to

1773
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,020
think about this

1774
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,300
it helps if you think in advance because

1775
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,099
then you get the right people who start

1776
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,660
again they start filing emergency

1777
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,300
petitions saying this has to be fixed

1778
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,900
getting judges orders I learned a lot

1779
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,540
real fast about how my relationship to

1780
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,280
my devices changed

1781
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,260
you ever get off an airplane

1782
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,880
put your phone back to regular mode you

1783
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,740
get some missed calls you get missed

1784
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,180
calls like this and your stomach just

1785
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,140
drops

1786
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,119
yeah didn't realize that I could get

1787
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,319
phone calls didn't realize how the

1788
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,720
system works asynchronous is

1789
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,460
communication does not work well when

1790
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,619
you have a loved one in a cage

1791
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,960
show a hands who uses any kind of like

1792
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,880
call filtering you get that like spam

1793
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,619
detected you know pot don't answer

1794
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:51,900
unknown number on your phone yeah not

1795
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,040
anymore you don't

1796
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,780
not with a loved one in custody no you

1797
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,980
pick up every damn time you don't know

1798
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,059
who it is it could be a lawyer's office

1799
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,579
could be someone else who uses spam

1800
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:00,839
filtering on their email

1801
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:02,819
we all use Spam filtering right or

1802
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:04,440
suspicious link detection

1803
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,819
not anymore you don't

1804
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,440
not with a loved on the inside Core

1805
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,180
Links is the only thing you got and it's

1806
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,640
routinely detected as suspicious because

1807
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,040
it's all a bunch of emails from prison

1808
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,940
so maintaining communication has been

1809
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,680
incredibly hard trying to figure out how

1810
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,119
to get someone commissary how to get

1811
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,500
someone money and funds using Western

1812
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,540
Union their name is spelled wrong and

1813
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,859
stuff their dead names in the system

1814
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,200
eventually we had to start figuring out

1815
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,180
oh we need medical paperwork we need to

1816
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:33,000
prove her ID well her idea is in her

1817
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,440
purse and her purse is in an Evidence

1818
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,460
Locker

1819
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,380
having these paperwork already in

1820
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,940
advance would have made wonders instead

1821
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,319
we've got our ex-wife running around the

1822
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,880
city trying to go to her apartment she

1823
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,619
got a key to her apartment go to the

1824
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,720
apartment and it looks trashed look

1825
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,740
through the window and everything's

1826
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,720
destroyed she's like what the hell is

1827
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,099
this and there's a master lock on the

1828
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,440
door so now you're thinking locksmith

1829
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,480
but no that you're thinking lawyer first

1830
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,040
I said if I was there I probably would

1831
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,540
have just opened this damn door

1832
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,460
I'm glad I wasn't there because we

1833
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,660
called the lawyers and they said oh no

1834
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,099
no no that actually might be an

1835
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:04,260
evidenced seal that might have been the

1836
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,540
feds doing that I'm like is it supposed

1837
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,520
to be like Yellow Tape she's like no no

1838
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,380
get your brain out of TV sometimes it's

1839
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,540
just this nonsense don't go in there let

1840
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,980
me file more paperwork

1841
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,680
and eventually we finally got a judge's

1842
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,500
order to say yes okay no here's a copy

1843
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,240
of the past with this person put them in

1844
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,520
the woman's prison please and Carol's

1845
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,900
finally moved

1846
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,720
that was a miracle that took a week and

1847
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,880
a half of stress and abused the likes I

1848
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,900
don't want to think about

1849
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,520
but we protected her from other inmate

1850
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,940
violence

1851
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,180
we couldn't protect her from staff

1852
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,099
violence though

1853
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,599
and mistreatment by the staff is why

1854
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,940
she's been moved again

1855
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,099
to a hospital

1856
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,200
not the prison Infirmary

1857
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,720
no a civilian hospital do you know what

1858
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,160
it takes to be in a civilian hospital if

1859
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,220
you're a prisoner you're near death

1860
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,079
and that's where she's been where she

1861
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:56,819
has no phone privileges we have no idea

1862
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,859
what's happening we don't have her if

1863
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,180
her wife was still her wife she could

1864
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,040
talk to the doctors but if someone's

1865
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,540
your ex-wife you need a medical power of

1866
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,880
attorney things that would take no time

1867
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,099
to have set up before your life goes

1868
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:08,880
crazy

1869
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,920
do you have loved ones who are closer

1870
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,420
than a spouse or a brother or sister to

1871
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,339
you the person they would want you to be

1872
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:15,480
the one in the room talking to the

1873
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,380
doctors

1874
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,480
if you haven't done a medical power of

1875
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,640
attorney you will be shut out you will

1876
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,740
not be in that conversation this takes

1877
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,500
five minutes and maybe 25 bucks to do it

1878
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,260
before it's a disaster

1879
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,559
our marvelous Cara I'm not going to show

1880
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,540
you what they've done to her

1881
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,700
but this is where things have been for

1882
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,780
weeks now

1883
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,160
and we've just tried to console

1884
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,780
ourselves with gradual updates that

1885
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,819
trickle out through her lawyers but

1886
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:43,140
again we're like well we just can't talk

1887
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,520
to her there's no there's no phones

1888
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,500
there's no phone on the wall

1889
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,940
and then one day I woke up in the

1890
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,920
morning and I had voicemails

1891
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,619
I said what the hell oh it turns out no

1892
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:54,420
like a duty officer came by with a phone

1893
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,980
but it's an unknown number so my phone

1894
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,359
didn't ring

1895
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,280
I had no idea it was Saturday morning

1896
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,720
most of her friends are Jewish so they

1897
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,160
were not near their phones

1898
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,480
so we all missed the chance to talk to

1899
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,220
her and find out an update so next

1900
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,839
weekend comes around

1901
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:08,520
it's like that movie Catch Me If You Can

1902
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,319
everyone's like right by the phone like

1903
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,119
they're gonna call this time right got

1904
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,079
up early

1905
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:14,579
no calls

1906
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,380
I went to a gun match I was like handing

1907
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,900
my phone on shooting stages like anybody

1908
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,579
who calls just answer this phone I've

1909
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,260
never given my phone to another human in

1910
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,420
years let alone told them to answer it

1911
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,400
but again you get that one shot you want

1912
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,559
to get that call no calls

1913
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,540
then Sunday morning we're all talking to

1914
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,740
each other and Signal has anyone heard

1915
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,180
anything nobody's heard anything no

1916
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,980
calls no we just didn't get a call that

1917
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,640
week

1918
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,839
why

1919
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,819
Fu it's a system

1920
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:41,339
the system is callous and indifferent

1921
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,140
the next week we cross our fingers we

1922
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,380
hope we pray Saturday no calls

1923
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,020
Sunday I was working at my desk and I

1924
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,700
just happened to have my my Google Voice

1925
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,440
tab open because I was like getting an

1926
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,000
MFA code or something which we shouldn't

1927
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,680
get through text but sorry my bank is

1928
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,400
old

1929
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,960
and I looked and I'm like that's weird

1930
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,579
my phone's sitting right here it's oh no

1931
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:02,040
no why is there no number calling me

1932
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,260
and I get a voicemail and my phone never

1933
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,900
rang like what the hell and I checked my

1934
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,220
phone I checked the ringer I'm messaging

1935
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,200
people and as I'm messaging people I get

1936
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,940
another call

1937
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,799
and I get another transcript

1938
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,780
and I am literally in tears at this

1939
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,900
point not knowing what is wrong and I'm

1940
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,220
panicking I'm telling is anyone going to

1941
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,660
answer tell someone else she's going to

1942
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,740
call you next I know and I get another

1943
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,859
voicemail you don't know what this feels

1944
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,740
like until you've been through it

1945
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,480
I literally re-recorded my voicemail

1946
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,160
greeting to a diff I was like I have a

1947
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,599
different direct end dial number that I

1948
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,880
don't use and I was like Cara call this

1949
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,619
number and I told her ex-wife call this

1950
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,260
number eventually she did she got the

1951
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,339
number she called so we got to talk

1952
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,319
briefly that day and talking is

1953
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:45,059
important communication is so important

1954
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:47,400
if you ever have a loved one who is

1955
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,500
jammed up communication is what keeps

1956
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,200
them alive and the system is not set up

1957
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,160
for that I eventually learned tip to you

1958
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,200
because it's a prison call it shows up

1959
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,000
as potentially spam or something so like

1960
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,319
Google voice does not give you granular

1961
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,540
help here I just have to turn this off

1962
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,440
and now my phone is a sewer of nonsense

1963
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,180
all of our phones are

1964
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,799
and that's what you go through that's

1965
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,119
what you on the outside go and it's

1966
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,140
worth it

1967
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,819
Cara is worth it to all of us on the

1968
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,440
outside who are pulling for it she gave

1969
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,540
far more than this in the service for

1970
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,400

1971
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,299

1972
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,740

1982
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,680
the idea of if someone you know is

01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,780
jammed up and you've got a bunch of

1984
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,859
people what they're going to try to do

1985
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:45,119
is like they get their call right so

1986
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,280
they try this person oh that person they

1987
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,780

1988
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,579

1989
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:52,200
busy or they don't know number didn't go

1990
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,940
through they might try to get maybe they

1991
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,920
reach person C for like a little bit oh

1992
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,359

1994
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,260

1995
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,339

1998
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,119
talk to someone all right bang you try

1999
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,740
someone else oh you couldn't reach them

2000
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,480
you're playing this freaking game right

2001
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,220
then you're out of time

2002
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,160
you could consider among your trusted

2003
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,480
Circle of Friends

2004
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,420
setting up talk route or ring central or

2005
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,579
somebody's a dab hand at asterisk

2006
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,619
you get one canonical like emergency

2007
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:24,180
number

2008
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,520
call that number and it rings everyone's

2009
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,540
phone

2010
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,339
whoever picked my company does this for

2011
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:30,720
our inbound phone calls for our support

2012
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,220
line and who whichever one of the

2013
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,660
partners picks up we're the one on that

2014
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,380
call

2015
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,599
and we even set it so it shows up as

2016
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,579
that number so we save that number in

2017
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,559
our phones as like you know company call

2018
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,660
you could do that you could save that

2019
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,700
number in all your phones and be like

2020
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,280
holy crap pick up now so it rings

2021
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,900
everyone's phone somebody gets it and

2022
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,579
then you're all in Signal like hey who

2023
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:51,839
called the emergency number what's going

2024
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,579
on and then everyone's spun up and

2025
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,500
talking and you got a human you got a

2026
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,720
human to human immediate connection

2027
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,880
or you conference other people in

2028
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,339
super super critical

2029
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:04,440
talk to your lawyers if someone is in

2030
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,119
custody just because I got arrested

2031
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,040
maybe you can have a conference call if

2032
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,079
someone is in prison you cannot have

2033
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,520
three-way conference calls of any kind

2034
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,319
they will lose their phone privileges

2035
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:14,700
they'll be sent to the shoe you will not

2036
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,740
talk to them again talk to your lawyers

2037
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:19,559
but having that one phone number to ring

2038
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,059
all your friends and emerge doesn't have

2039
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:22,859
to be a prison situation it could

2040
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:24,480
literally be I'm on the side of the road

2041
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,520
my car's dead my battery's almost dead

2042
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,079
and you don't have time to screw around

2043
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,599
figuring out who's awake you call the

2044
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,280
emergency number and because you set it

2045
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,140
up as VoIP you can make it memorable

2046
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,059
like this is the one number you remember

2047
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,220
and like everyone just that's the one

2048
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,839
I'm gonna call in case anything happens

2049
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,380
I got another tip and you're being I'm

2050
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,940
so so kind you're being very respectful

2051
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,260
we've gone a little over the hour but

2052
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,819
these last couple ones I'm Really Gonna

2053
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:54,359
this one might be good for you so let's

2054
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:55,920
say you have someone in your life and

2055
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,299
this person is missing we'll call them

2056
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:59,579
missing Manny up at the top there

2057
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,859
if Manny goes missing their friends are

2058
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,839
all worried about him right friends are

2059
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,220
worried about Manny what happened to

2060
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,660
them do we know where they are they

2061
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,040
should have been on that plane by now

2062
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,780
everyone's messaging they're on their

2063
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,940
phones

2064
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,339
Manny may not have a phone right it may

2065
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:16,260
be dead it might be taken away from them

2066
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,940
whatever their circumstances are could

2067
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,380
be lost

2068
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,200
this is where the special lawyer comes

2069
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,339
into play

2070
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:24,960
my wife and I and a few of our very

2071
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,579
critical close circle of friends have a

2072
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,980
special lawyer they have one job

2073
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,780
she lives overseas she has special

2074
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,339
practice we only talk to her for this

2075
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:33,539
one thing

2076
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:36,299
the special lawyer has the master

2077
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:38,220
passwords to all of our critical friends

2078
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,099
vaults in their vault

2079
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,720
in this sense this is not for your whole

2080
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,920
group of friends this is for your

2081
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,960
critical trusted Circle you get

2082
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,640
established as a trusted Circle you talk

2083
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,559
to the lawyer and what happens is like

2084
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,900
Samantha's spouse calls the lawyer and

2085
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,180
says hey there's been an emergency Manny

2086
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,220
is missing they are inexplicably accent

2087
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,020
detained maybe they're in a coma you

2088
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,819
don't know but like we need to get into

2089
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:01,619
their password Vault we need to get into

2090
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:02,880
their critical documents we need

2091
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,140
something from them

2092
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,020
the lawyer says okay immediately sends a

2093
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,520
message out to the rest of the circle

2094
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,559
and says the emergency protocol is being

2095
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,720
invoked Samantha's spouse has asked me

2096
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,760
for Manny's password

2097
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,160
there's a 72-hour pause while everyone

2098
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,960
can think about this chances are the

2099
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,160
rest of the circle already knows what's

2100
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,799
up but maybe Samantha's lying maybe

2101
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,240
there's a just like a divorce going on

2102
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,280
any one of those friends can say to the

2103
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,680
lawyer uh wait one

2104
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,720
let's figure out that something's fishy

2105
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,819
because it immediately the cat's out of

2106
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,440
the bag the moment that Samantha makes

2107
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,599
the request maybe Manny's not missing

2108
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,400
maybe Manny's like on a beach is like

2109
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,280
what the hell is this [ __ ] like you

2110
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,900
you have that but if nothing happens if

2111
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,299
nobody objects the lawyer releases the

2112
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:46,740
top master password

2113
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,480
and you can get into the records and the

2114
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,680
critical things and all that you need

2115
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,319
that can be a huge difference in those

2116
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,819
critical hours of dealing with the state

2117
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,319
department or dealing with a lawyer who

2118
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:57,480
knows what this protocol applies

2119
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,799
perfectly well

2120
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,599
even if a spouse dies

2121
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:02,880
or both spouses die Tara and I are

2122
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,559
almost always together a lot of the time

2123
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,000
I'm in the right seat of a plane that

2124
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,460
she is flying so like maybe we go down

2125
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,900
together who knows that's that's a cool

2126
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,579
way to go out in my opinion but people

2127
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:13,140
still need to you know set our Affairs

2128
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,160
in order

2129
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,439
our friends in our trusted Circle can

2130
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,819
still work with the lawyer they can make

2131
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:19,500
changes to social media they can say hey

2132
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,420
maybe don't tweet at this guy he did you

2133
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,040
know whatever you got to do

2134
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,738
but there's there's in this instance we

2135
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,479
have a backup now you don't have to do

2136
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,160
this with a lawyer if you're familiar

2137
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,799
with shimmy or shared secrets you can do

2138
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:33,660
it's a lot more technical lift right but

2139
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,479
you can have a locked archive and

2140
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,339
multiple people with distributed keys

2141
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:40,799
and you can set it so that like three

2142
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,420
out of five or six out of ten or

2143
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,100
whatever prep whatever number of keys

2144
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,198
you need can be brought together to

2145
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:48,179
deconstruct that top master key and open

2146
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:49,859
the archive

2147
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,839
this is something that we need to talk

2148
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,859
about

2149
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,020
this is some we we used to like not talk

2150
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,120
about death and dying like getting go

2151
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,399
get yourself a will or when it became

2152
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:01,198
really good at keeping people alive but

2153
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,060
like not alive like in ventilators we

2154
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,380
had to start talking about do not

2155
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,238
resuscitate orders right Advanced

2156
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,100
Medical directives that was a weird

2157
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,439
thing to talk about for years but people

2158
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,660
oh don't talk about that oh Maron give

2159
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,279
yourself them a like gonna attempt the

2160
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,380
Fate we got over that as a society we

2161
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,698
talk about that now

2162
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:20,399
we need to start having this equivalent

2163
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,859
of a discussion for our digital lives

2164
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,600
and we don't yet

2165
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,939
we need to start talking about how

2166
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,679
painful it is to a lot of friends to

2167
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:30,479
still see that old Facebook page from

2168
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,799
your dead friend from three years ago

2169
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:33,600
with that last update that's still there

2170
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,640
and like yeah technically social media

2171
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,259
companies have ways to do that but it's

2172
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:38,279
clunky

2173
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,679
consider these other means consider some

2174
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,198
of these plans and come up with a plan

2175
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,380
for these emergencies my conclusion is

2176
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,698
is very brief

2177
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:50,160
I have been involved in a lot of

2178
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,679
different projects in my life uh one of

2179
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:54,299
the most important things that I've ever

2180
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:55,620
gotten to be a part of was being

2181
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,600
embroiled in a prosecutorial matter at

2182
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,920
the federal level

2183
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,320
we all learned really fast no one knew

2184
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,179
what we were doing but the community

2185
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,980
came together we put the right pieces in

2186
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,760
place

2187
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,980
and a young man's life is saved and he's

2188
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,260
free and he's part of our world now this

2189
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,760
was a good result

2190
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,340
make no mistake sorry to my

2191
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,679
State Department friends like getting to

2192
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,800
just gouge a thumb right in the eye of a

2193
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,179
federal prosecution was one of the most

2194
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:22,980
proud moments of my life

2195
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,960
and if all of you take this kind of

2196
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,340
knowledge and I'll give you a little

2197
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,360
checklist

2198
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,520
if you work down this checklist you can

2199
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,620
be the thorn in the side of an attacker

2200
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,199
of of a threat that could be a civilian

2201
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,699
threat a government threat it could be

2202
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:38,400
any intangible thing horrible things can

2203
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,679
happen but you know Sans is like known

2204
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:42,600
for their top 20s in the nist Cyber

2205
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,040
controls top 20. I'm going to give you a

2206
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,840
top 20. we're going to bash down it real

2207
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,100
quick

2208
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,260
think about all of these in the context

2209
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,540
of some of the scenarios I've discussed

2210
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,000
this is a long list but you can take

2211
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,100
bites of it over time starting with

2212
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,360
something you probably are I'll give you

2213
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,920
a freebie who here uses a password

2214
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,620
manager great those of you who aren't

2215
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,420
using it start using one

2216
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,219
and don't just put passwords in it put

2217
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,600
everything in it put your copies of your

2218
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,860
birth certificate your driver's license

2219
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,900
your will just shove it in there there's

2220
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,239
notes Fields like get critical stuff in

2221
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,159
there so it's in one place getting

2222
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,659
backed up to the cloud if you're using

2223
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,219
one password one password is one of my

2224
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:19,140
favorite ones right it syncs across all

2225
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,699
your devices

2226
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:24,120
get your closest friends contact info

2227
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,280
I don't just mean like know how to tweet

2228
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,900
at them how many people have like some

2229
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,820
really good friends that you're only on

2230
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,860
like social media with them and

2231
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,480
sometimes they like put their account on

2232
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,280
lock or they get banned or they go dark

2233
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,500
or something you're like oh [ __ ] I don't

2234
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,520
actually know how to reach that person

2235
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,159
get your closest friends contact info

2236
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,560
get their most unchanging email address

2237
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,000
not their work address where they're

2238
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,920
going to get a new job put that in your

2239
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,640
contacts right get their full birth date

2240
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,280
if they're really close to you getting

2241
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,900
things like medical records dealing with

2242
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,020
hospitals full birth dates matter

2243
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,420
make that Wallet card that phone case

2244
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,040
card those critical numbers put it in

2245
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,420
your phone case

2246
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,980
once you've established your trusted

2247
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,540
Circle you're going to have that

2248
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,800
conversation

2249
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,000
you're going to have that conversation

2250
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,219
about MFA backup codes remember when you

2251
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,719
get your MFA like you set up your device

2252
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:13,980
and Google Authenticator and you get

2253
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,020
those backup codes right what do you do

2254
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:17,340
with those you just shove them in your

2255
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,260
password manager which lives on your

2256
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,140
phone which then goes in a sewer no take

2257
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,699
some of those backup codes and give them

2258
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,320
to your other friends over signal and

2259
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,780
say keep these in your password manager

2260
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,580
I will probably never need these one day

2261
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,880
but just in case they've got them

2262
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,739
agree to have a check-in every so often

2263
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:37,980
right it's almost kind of like NATO like

2264
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,840
just establish We Are The Trusted Circle

2265
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,880
I could leave my house at the drop of a

2266
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,260
hat if I'm under threat can I stay in

2267
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,719
your bedroom you can stay in mine I will

2268

01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,120
before you needed it right set a

2431
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,500
calendar reminder for a couple years in

2432
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,520
the future to see if they're still in

2433
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,080
business

2434
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,480
maybe meet your neighbors maybe actually

2435
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,280
get to trust them one day how many

2436
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,840
people know they're freaking neighbors I

2437
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,340
my wife thought I was the strangest

2438
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,960
person in the world that I met my actual

2439
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,100
neighbors and she's like what are you

2440
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,060
doing we don't do that out of the

2441
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,100
Pacific Northwest but no my neighbors

2442
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,960
have a key right my neighbors have a key

2443
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,340
they actually have the code to our lock

2444
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,739
box which is you know right there maybe

2445
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:14,940
you're at the point where your neighbors

2446
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:15,960
have a key

2447
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,400
and you build some stuff now we're

2448
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,900
getting into some reach goals here right

2449
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,460
but like I gave a whole talk about

2450
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,460
de-escalation training soft skills as my

2451
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,020
friend Bree likes to say like she's like

2452
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,060
oh my God hackers you all need therapy

2453
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:29,820
get your head right and be in a place

2454
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,580
where you can do some real good from the

2455
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,719
rest of the world when you're under

2456
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:34,980
stress

2457
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,960
again real real reach goals you're not

2458
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,159
all going to get to the end of this list

2459
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:41,280
easily anytime soon have a go bag it's

2460
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,659
not the go bag that some prep or

2461
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,340
website's showing you it's literally a

2462
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,900
bag with hard copies and a flash drive

2463
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,060
electronic copies of all these documents

2464
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,239
spare medical supplies glasses when you

2465
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:52,860
get a new prescription throw your old

2466
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,659
prescription in your go bag if your main

2467
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,040
glasses are broken they're going to be

2468
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,719
still at least something if you have

2469
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:59,760
pets kids maybe throw a few diapers some

2470
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,860
Cat Chow in there right phone charger

2471
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,900
even if it's a crappy phone charger or a

2472
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,640
power bank throw it in there maybe even

2473
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,560
run drills my wife and I run a drill

2474
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,780
where we Evac the house as if we had to

2475
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,880
leave maybe not coming back pack the

2476
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,920
cats pack the bags pack the rifle get in

2477
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,600
the car

2478
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,219
that second passport that's going to be

2479
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,679
a real reach you do that you're getting

2480
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,679
really into those long-term robust goals

2481
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,260
of like real Surety real deep deep deep

2482
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,020
protections defense in depth

2483
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,340
at the end of that I mean it just gets

2484
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,900
easy right you know you divest your

2485
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,520
local police department you abolish

2486
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,320
prisons like you know the simple stuff

2487
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,540
that we should get to one of these days

2488
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,880
and the last one I'll tell you is never

2489
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,699
miss the opportunity to tell everybody

2490
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:43,620
in your life how much you love them and

2491
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,300
miss them and how much they matter to

2492
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,560
you and how much you will be there for

2493
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,540
them and you appreciate them because you

2494
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,219
will probably lose the opportunity when

2495
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,199
the worst thing happens and I encourage

2496
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:54,780
you to be prepared if you start small

2497
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,239
you start local you start with your

2498
01:19:57,239 --> 01:20:00,600
trusted Circle you will be astounded at

2499
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,699
what you can accomplish

2500
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,699
if enough of us make our way through a

2501
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:07,500
list like this

2502
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,840
that is what changes the world that is

2503
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,239
what changes lives we've heard so many

2504
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,560
times from the hacker world right the

2505
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,940
cavalry's not coming

2506
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,880
it's just us

2507
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,560
it's just us

2508
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,420
they don't keep us safe

2509
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,280
we keep ourselves safe

2510
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,440
we protect us

2511
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,940
thank you for listening

2512
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:31,690
[Applause]
