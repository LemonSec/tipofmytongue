52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,560
Labs community

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,660

microphone right there you can expect a

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,739
lot of wires and cabling and Power Drop

58
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,319
so we got everything from hypervisors to

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,220
networks to fiber runs to

60
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,300
Docker Labs we got challenges for the

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,440
hackers challenge we got a little bit of

62

all right we're now going to talk about

157
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,400

158
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,259
what attendees should expect when they

159

attendees come over here you're gonna

225
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
have to speak into that so we've got to

226
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,380
capture the flag event where we

227
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,120
basically have different challenges that

228
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
are set up on these monitors we've got a

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
QR code that you're going to want to

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,459
scan and then it'll take you to the

231
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,500
challenges that you can do and basically

232
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,880
what we're going to do is it's anywhere

233

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,760
that we're actually trying to see if

236
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,860
anybody can hack into it we've removed

237
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,120
the actual

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,700
um antenna so it's not broadcasting but

239

was a pacemaker but basically over here

241
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,540
on this computer you can go ahead and

242
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,820
actually try to hack into it so it's a

243
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,140
challenge to see if you can actually get

244
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,380
rid access on there so and then again

245

Tamper evidence tamper evident community

287
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,680
and the contest associated with it is

288
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,620
one of the Staples at St con every year

289
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,839
and one of the coolest things that if

290
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,360
you've never learned about these

291
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,660
techniques about getting into uh devices

292
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,600
and well getting into packaging and all

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,700
sorts of stuff there's a cool place to

294
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,160
go so tell us what attendees can expect

295
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,660
when they come over here

296
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,240
[Music]

297
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,200
yeah basically we're teaching you how to

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,820
void your warranties and not get and get

299
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,040
away with that not get caught so yeah we

300
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,320
have all kinds of tapes here and various

301
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
devices that you can uh remove and then

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,079
hopefully re-put them back together so

303
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,480
that nobody knows that they're done

304
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
a lot of things like your concert

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,839
wristbands that people are very familiar

306
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,160
with

307
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,260
the thing on your electric box outside

308
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,399
your house

309
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,100
how to tamper with that yeah we just

310
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,300
have a good time here with a lot of that

311
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,160
we teach a lot of it we've got a game

312
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,680
going too where are you intercept a

313
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
fingerprint that's on its way to the FIB

314
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,459
agency this year and you've got to

315
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,260
replace the fingerprint and then reseal

316
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,640
it all back up so that they never know

317
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,560
you were there changing anything

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,700

a limited number of people that actually

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,980
can be part of this contest correct so

323

security devices all right as we come

367
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,760
along the back side here of our Valcom

368
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,940
tent the next section here right here is

369
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,899
the Vault hey we got a couple of a

370
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,820
couple of folks here that we know very

371
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,639

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,240
attendees should expect when they come

374
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,060
here visit the vault I can so the vault

375
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,160
is comprised of four rooms let's let's

376
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
go around a little bit here we've got

377
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
one of them open that we're getting

378
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,519
ready to lock up

379
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,579
so we've got our four rooms we've got

380
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,440
two on this side and two on the other

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
side each day these rooms will get

382
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,839
increasingly more and more difficult so

383
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,940
if you're gonna plan to play and compete

384
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,440
in this challenge I highly suggest you

385
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,300
start today because afterwards these

386
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,459
doors are ramping up in security so we

387
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,820
have a combo Simplex 1000 right here

388
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,560
um so you are more than welcome as long

389
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,180
as you don't destroy try and get in any

390
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,420
way you can through the uh side here

391
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,060
lock pick try and see if there's a

392
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,220
defeat for the actual keypad under the

393
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,000
door tool we have an RFID door right

394
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,459
here we're just wiring up

395
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,240
um

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,500
uh this door has a wrecks inside uh the

397
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,360
same that you'll see if you go up under

398
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,420
up under the door so you've got a Rex uh

399
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,800
to sense when people are coming out of

400
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,540
the door so you can try and attack that

401
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,480
we have a low frequency reader uh that

402
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,760
will be in play tomorrow and then we'll

403
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,160
scale it up to a high frequency i-class

404
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,139
reader on the other side

405
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
we have four safes and each of these

406
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,720
safes will have a label stating their

407
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,420
difficulty we have a beginner which only

408
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,399
has two wheels two numbers that you have

409
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,740
to crack we have a safe cracking

410
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,480
instructions these are from the company

411
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,060
sparrows we've retrofitted them to fit

412
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,620
onto these safe boxes we've got your

413
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,139
graphing paper then they uh rank up from

414
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,820
easy medium difficult

415
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,860
uh uh once inside you'll see these RFID

416
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,779
scanners as part of your team you'll get

417
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,459
one RFID badge and that's how you'll

418
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,779
collect your points whenever you breach

419
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,940
a safe or a door you scan your badge and

420
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,100
you get your points we have door number

421
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,760
one our very simple door lever handle

422
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,720
um

423
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
uh

424
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,860
uh you can try and attack the side we've

425
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,380
got a standard residential deadbolt and

426
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,600
then we have our hard door so door four

427
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,420
we have a Bluetooth lock if you'd like

428
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,279
to try and intercept any signals we'll

429
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,019
go ahead and unlock it for you and then

430
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,959
we actually have underneath this a

431
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
a safe lock this will be in scope

432
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
tomorrow we'll open this up so right now

433
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,720
we'll ask that you don't touch that just

434
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,579
focus on the deadbolt both of those will

435
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,559
be in play tomorrow that's the Vault

436

438
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,179
Wednesday they increase Thursday they

439
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,640
increase and then uh Friday you'll have

440
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,740
one last chance in the afternoon the

441
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,119
safes will be increasing look on the

442
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,799
front for their difficulty and that's

443
