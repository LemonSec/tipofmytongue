1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
welcome everybody uh glad to see you out

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,620
here this afternoon uh I'm going to be

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,299
talking to you about securing a remote

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,039
Workforce this is something that has

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,080
been my day in day out job for the last

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
two years uh my name is Jesse Harris I'm

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,040
a cyber security analyst I work at

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,719
microfocus you may know their building

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,180
down the road I'm sure that half of this

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,260
room has probably worked there at some

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,820
point

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
uh so question is who am I

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,800
um yes that is me that's December 1985

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,260
in a Commodore 64. so I've been doing

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,760
I've been doing computer stuff for a

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
very long time our family picked up our

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,300
first in-home computer in 1989 it was a

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,180
Packard Bell 286 before Packard belt was

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,140
really awful

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,600
uh I gotta hand-me-down 286 for my

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,579
grandfather two years later which since

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,860
that I've been building all my own

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,140
um my home setup now is hopelessly over

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,640
engineered I'm part of the Utah home

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,500
labs and you've probably seen them in

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,059
the exhibit hall with the giant rack of

27
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,440
gear that's what all of our homes look

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
like

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,180
my my background has been mostly in

30
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,920
technical support I've also worked with

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,539
some cyber security companies uh

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,540
Symantec supporting pgp it's also with

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,700
RSA for eight years for landing at

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,460
microfocus I will make absolutely no

35
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,439
apologies for the mini puns dad jokes

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,240
and memes in the slide deck that's how I

37
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,960
roll

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
so if you're not good with this this is

39
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,640
not the presentation for you

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
so these are some of my top threats to

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,420
physical security in my home

42
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,400
uh those of you who have children will

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,920
understand this the toddler will just

44
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
happily wander in and start banging away

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,939
on the keyboard like she's dead

46
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,159
um I have the good sense to lock my

47
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,860
workstation but one time she managed to

48
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,299
get me locked out of it by entering an

49
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,579
incorrect password one too many times

50
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,159
uh what would have happened if I had

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,540
been locked out permanently how would

52
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,939
have I have gotten back in I all the

53
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,140
contacts I have are sitting on that

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,220
computer I'd have to figure out some

55
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,619
other way to log in so this does raise

56
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,600
some interesting questions of what kind

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,460
of physical security questions start

58
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,380
popping up when people are working from

59
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,880
home

60
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,040
um you know how are you going to

61
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,420
validate that that person is who they

62
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,040
say they are when they call and say help

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,039
my kids locked me out of my workstation

64
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,780
do you know how to identify them

65
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,400
do you

66
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
quick show of hands how many of you know

67
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,440
your employee ID

68
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,459
I have no idea what it is I couldn't

69
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,379
tell you at all but that's the first

70
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,760
piece of information that helped us ask

71
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,099
you for when you call in and so you have

72
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,840
to provide alternate ways of identifying

73
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,099
yourself that can be a real challenge

74
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,020
with remote employees if they may try to

75
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,300
engineer their way into a system

76
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,959
um

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,520
you know I have to go log into workday

78
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
and figure out what that is

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,060
you they don't have the ability to walk

80
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,920
down the hall knock on its door to get a

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,540
problem like that solved

82
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,599
so that's that is one big challenge uh

83
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,840
there is your kids could impact

84
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,860
effectively be a denial of service on

85
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,599
you getting your work done

86
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,400
so I want to talk about the difference

87
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,900
between physical security in your office

88
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,760
and physical security at home

89
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,620
so if you think of your typical office

90
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,300
building and how it's physically secured

91
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,940
you have some walking front doors you

92
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,440
probably have a key card based entry

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,420
there's probably someone sitting there

94
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,640
at the front desk to vet visitors

95
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,379
you are educating your users on

96
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,920
tailgating walking their workstations

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,780
the way that we at one job we educated

98
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,280
people unlocking their workstations by

99
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,540
changing their background to a picture

100
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,040
of David Hasselhoff whenever they did

101
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,680
not

102
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,379
you yeah you always lived lived in fear

103
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,959
of being hoffed there's probably

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
security cameras all over the place

105
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,800
probably a closed circuit you got a fire

106
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
suppression system you've got secured

107
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
areas within the building with

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,140
restricted access maybe even like a

109
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,080
skiff if you're doing federal work

110
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,700
you're doing a lot to prevent loss

111
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,560
through theft or natural disaster

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
so are you going to replicate this

113
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
physical security at home

114
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,620
you obviously can't replicate all of it

115
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,060
uh you're not going to ask your

116
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,440
employees to have keycard entry into

117
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,019
their house they're not going to have an

118
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,340
assistant at their house vetting people

119
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,920
at the door you're not going to have a

120
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,959
sprinkler system in somebody's house

121
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,819
but all the threats are still there

122
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,379
aren't they there's the threat of

123
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,700
someone being in there that shouldn't be

124
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,159
there there's the threat of fire or

125
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,080
natural disaster that may cause data

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,420
loss or equipment loss these are all

127
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,860
things that you have to kind of shift

128
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,780
your thinking of well how are we

129
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,160
handling that physical security when

130
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,560
someone's in the home you know do we

131
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,180
give them tips on making sure they're

132
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,880
operating in a safe workspace do we have

133
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
some sort of program to help them secure

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,380
that physical workspace I'm fortunate in

135
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,660
that I have a dedicated office but you

136
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,400
know a lot of employees when they were

137
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,740
forced remote from covid there was no

138
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,600
office they sat at the kitchen table or

139
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,660
at the couch or wherever nor should we

140
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,600
have expect them to just replicate their

141
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,240
office environment at home you know the

142
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,740
whole point of remote work is you work

143
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,720
wherever you can get the work done

144
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,660
and so you have to very much change your

145
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,740
mindset when it comes to physical

146
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,120
security that way and that's something

147
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,520
that we've had to consider too

148
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,960
um

149
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,880
you know we think of

150
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,500
um you know the workspace now is not

151
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,240
just a home but I've done plenty of

152
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,740
working vacations I mean while I've been

153
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,440
here I've been out in the lobby taking

154
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,199
meetings getting work stuff done and

155
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,000
what could be considered an unsecured

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,220
open environment you might stroll down

157
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,660
to your neighborhood coffee shop and

158
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
decide this is a great place to work

159
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,000
today

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
you may even decide you know what Puerto

161
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,860
Vallarta is calling my name I'm going to

162
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,020
go use my laptop on the beach today

163
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,419
that's you you have a whole host of

164
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,160
other physical security concerns there

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,000
uh I actually uh had had someone who she

166
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
took her laptop to to the beach and you

167
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,360
know it was working there and you know

168
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
she didn't get it wet or anything but

169
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,780
there was enough salt spray in the air

170
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,900
to cause corrosion and kill the laptop

171
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,419
that's that is a physical security

172
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,800
concern because you're looking at the

173
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,780
loss of a device and the loss of being

174
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,699
able to be productive you know so

175
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,139
there's another security thing to think

176
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,360
of you're also thinking about you know

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,740
attacks a little differently you do

178
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,180
think about shoulder surfing in an

179
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,300
office but if you're in a public space

180
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,940
man you everybody's a shoulder Surfer I

181
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,620
mean how many how many screens that are

182
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,900
not yours have you seen today

183
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,479
[Laughter]

184
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,580
exactly all of them

185
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,180
um

186
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,100
you have to worry about you know an

187
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,259
evil-made attack where somebody has

188
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,180
physical access to the device and may be

189
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,280
able to fill her data for instance

190
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,900
you're in the coffee shop you're working

191
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,240
away someone calls up your or because

192
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
someone calls up hey I've got your chai

193
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
latte ready

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
you get up for a second

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,259
you've taken your eyes off that system

196
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,759
for just long enough for someone to plug

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,500
in some USB device and load something

198
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,720
and walk away

199
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,460
um so it takes a lot of Education there

200
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,620
of you know making people think in terms

201
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,940
of that especially if they're working in

202
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,160
those public spaces you can think of

203
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,259
things such as making sure that laptops

204
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,060
are always locked they're powered off

205
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,699
that you're using privacy filters or

206
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,840
that you have your back to the wall

207
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,759
where you're in a public space so

208
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,900
there's a little bit of user training

209
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,060
that's involved there that you might not

210
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,680
necessarily have to do when everyone's

211
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,479
in an office because in an office

212
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,400
usually odds are good if someone sees

213
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,360
the information they probably should

214
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,139
have access to it

215
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,880
missing laptops such a huge problem with

216
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,719
the remote Workforce

217
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,620
when you have it sitting in the office

218
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,940
all the time you don't really have to

219
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,099
worry about it disappearing you know

220
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,560
more more often than not it's going to

221
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,419
be there when you come home but the more

222
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,479
move events you have of well I had it at

223
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,940
home but then I took it to school so I

224
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
could work between classes and then

225
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
after that I went to the co-working

226
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,160
space and I worked there and then I

227
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,599
threw it in my car because of going to

228
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,220
dinner after that and so it stayed in my

229
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,900
car that's creating a lot of

230
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,240
opportunities for loss via theft and you

231
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,220
have to think about you know those kinds

232
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,740
of problems there you also have to think

233
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,120
about you know the value of all those

234
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,819
assets like at home I have the corporate

235
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,099
issued laptop and I also have a pair of

236
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,800
Mac minis sitting on my desk for testing

237
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,139
Mac OS software making sure that we can

238
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,180
support those with security software I

239
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,919
have a few thousand dollars of company

240
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,680
assets sitting in my house

241
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,280
um

242
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
if I change jobs

243
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,539
obviously I'm gonna have to mail it all

244
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,580
back you would be surprised how many

245
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,199
people think that that laptop is a

246
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
parting gift

247
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,180
we have far too many instances of where

248
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,520
laptops disappear and

249
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm not a lawyer but that this by your

250
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,620
corporate counselor lawyer or whoever

251
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,759
you trust

252
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,660
um you know not Lionel huts

253
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,680
you can't you don't really have a lot of

254
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,679
recourse except filing a theft report if

255
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,200
someone steals a laptop and for a

256
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,940
three-year-old laptop whose value is

257
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,399
depreciated to a few hundred dollars are

258
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,380
you going to go through that

259
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,000
but the data's still sitting on that

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,399
laptop isn't it and the data is what

261
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,480
you're concerned with you're not really

262
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,339
concerned about you know that laptop

263
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,839
that you might E-Waste for a few hundred

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
dollars you're concerned with all the

265
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,779
data there

266
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,180
so you have to be especially concerned

267
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,580
with what kind of controls you have when

268
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,040
you no longer have can get that device

269
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,500
in your physical possession

270
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,360
and so you're looking at a lot of Basics

271
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
there you're looking at things like

272
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,660
having disk encryption you're looking at

273
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,920
having some sort of Remote Management

274
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,860
platform that can do lockouts or wipe

275
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,440
the drive your endpoint software will

276
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,540
give you a lot of data about a system

277
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,180
last time it booted up it's last known

278
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,899
IP address the time zone it's in all

279
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,580
sorts of very relevant information that

280
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,200
can help you with locating where it is

281
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,500
in the case of theft or loss

282
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,180
um so these these are a lot of things to

283
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,279
bear in mind is is your asset tracking

284
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,660
and making sure that when it comes back

285
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,040
to the depot you know where it's gone

286
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,940
so I rented this unique problem the

287
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,980
first time I went into the office

288
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,240
um it was about a year and a half after

289
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,080
I was hired and because I the only time

290
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,459
I'd ever been at the office was to pick

291
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,779
up my badge you want to guess what I

292
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,220
didn't remember to bring with me when I

293
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,240
went in there

294
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
the badge I left the badge sitting at my

295
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,860
desk on home and I realized realized

296
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,060
that right as I was pulling into the

297
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,560
parking lot I am certainly not going to

298
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,180
drive two and a half hours back home to

299
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,620
pick up the badge

300
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,260
fortunately I had a co-worker there who

301
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,760
knew who I was knew who I was coming it

302
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,339
could get me vetted for that badge

303
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,779
so

304
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,160
this will be this is an obvious

305
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,540
challenge for remote employees when you

306
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,279
go where someone in the office may not

307
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,720
have any idea who they are because

308
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,459
they've never seen them before

309
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,880
and in my case my direct manager is in

310
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,580
Germany the co-workers on my team are in

311
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,279
India I'm going into an office in Provo

312
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,260
and fortunately for me I knew someone

313
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,060
there but if I hadn't they wouldn't have

314
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,220
known who I was at all

315
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,899
and so you have to make sure you have a

316
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,420
way to vet those situations where a

317
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,060
remote or hybrid employee you have a way

318
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,800
to know that they should be in that

319
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
physical location it does create some

320
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,240
challenges for physical access there

321
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,980
um you know having those contacts in the

322
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,660
office that know you who you are is very

323
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
good you want to encourage people to get

324
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,839
to know their co-workers across multiple

325
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,120
teams because it does create some

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,920
opportunities for some social

327
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,480
engineering someone can come up and say

328
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,060
Hey you know I'm a remote employee I've

329
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,040
never been in the office before I'm here

330
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,620
to see you know Bob Jones and you know

331
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,180
because they've went and looked through

332
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,440
your company directory that's on your

333
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,140
website and I don't think he's in today

334
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,700
but he knows and come in can you just

335
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,140
get me a visitor badge so I can get in

336
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,040
here

337
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
that would work on an awful lot of

338
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,360
people at reception wouldn't it

339
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,740
and so you need to make sure that you

340
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,060
have those kinds of controls in place

341
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,839
for those situations

342
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,860
of course I'm going to tell you every

343
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,019
land is hostile

344
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,120
we all know about zero trust

345
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,680
and

346
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,360
that's something that has become even

347
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,459
more prevalent with remote when you're

348
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,320
thinking of your corporate land

349
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm betting a lot of you in here have

350
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,459
flat corporate lands don't you

351
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,320
anyone can talk to any box on the

352
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,459
corporate land

353
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,200
I know you're not proud of it I'm not

354
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,060
proud of it either

355
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,779
um

356
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,160
and

357
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,140
weak Zero's crust thrown around a lot as

358
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,700
a buzzword and I'm sure we all want to

359
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,140
stab the sales people in the face to

360
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,180
keep using it and using it incorrectly

361
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,440
and but it is it is very important uh we

362
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,700
have to pretend that every land is

363
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,860
hostile if you think about a home

364
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,880
network

365
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,760
if somebody's working from home they've

366
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,560
got family members there

367
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,300
do you think all those family members

368
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,519
are using good security practices

369
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,019
do you think your kids use good security

370
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,180
practices

371
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,459
they they do not they say oh that's

372
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,140
downloading a cool Minecraft out on yeah

373
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm gonna download that I'm gonna run it

374
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,540
right now

375
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
instead it's ransomware it wants to

376
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,560
spread across the land

377
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,980
where your employees laptop is sitting

378
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,019
and so you've got to make sure that you

379
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,700
have adequate controls on all of your

380
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,680
East-West traffic across the network not

381
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,139
just what's going in and out anymore and

382
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,639
the problem is now your network is

383
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,200
everywhere a corporate device happens to

384
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,100
be

385
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,380
that's every home network every coffee

386
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,260
shop every Public Library every school

387
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,720
network it's everywhere

388
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,279
and so there's no such thing as a

389
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,200
trusted Network anymore

390
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,740
um we I think as uh as a group I.T and

391
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,180
cyber security have gotten overly

392
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,420
reliant on the idea of topology playing

393
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,740
a crucial role in security and it can

394
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,540
but we have broken down so many of those

395
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,060
walls now

396
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,720
um

397
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,820
you know and they don't no one's going

398
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,680
to have particularly good Security on

399
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,260
their home network I mean my kids want

400
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,579
to watch Plex they want to be able to

401
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,139
cast to the Chromecast I don't want them

402
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,360
to come bug me every time it breaks I

403
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,980
don't want to sell them oh you're on the

404
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,959
wrong VLAN let me fix that for you

405
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,399
they don't want to hear me say that

406
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,660
they're just like Dad it just doesn't

407
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,980
work stop with your nerd talk

408
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,600
um you know that's really it is the home

409
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
networks are pretty wild west that way

410
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
now you think about the kind of stuff

411
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,100
that people are attaching to their home

412
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,260
networks it's not just a laptop that's

413
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,519
running maybe some suspicious

414
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,139
applications

415
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,779
who's plugging in some nice wise network

416
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,959
cameras to their Network

417
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
just plug it in that handy dandy 20

418
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,279
Walmart smart thermostat to their

419
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,320
Network

420
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,779
who's running a router that hasn't seen

421
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,420
an update in five years

422
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,639
everybody

423
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
those home networks are a terrifying

424
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,760
soup of danger

425
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,320
and you have to make sure that you're

426
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,220
treating it like it is

427
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
and that's where I'm tying in of how you

428
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,720
know

429
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,279
this

430
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,959
there are a lot of problems with those

431
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,779
iot devices that could be you know an

432
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,279
issue within a home within networks

433
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,360
there are a lot of them that have been

434
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360
found that they phone home for no

435
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,459
apparent reason they just keep shuttling

436
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,620
data off to you know some data warehouse

437
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,980
in China

438
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,440
and

439
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,820
you know I can I can think back when I

440
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,380
was doing on-site computer repair 20

441
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,519
years ago

442
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,680
if I looked at a device and saw what was

443
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,720
going wrong with it I the I could

444
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
immediately say your kids use this don't

445
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,660
they

446
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,820
because you would see all the toolbars

447
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,560
installed you'd see that stupid Bonzi

448
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,060
buddy monkey swinging across the screen

449
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,760
you would see pop-ups Galore

450
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,339
because kids don't know any better even

451
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,139
if even our kids don't know any better

452
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,480
and we're telling them better

453
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,260
um

454
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
you know so in this case what you need

455
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,440
to make sure of is every corporate

456
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,079
device needs to have a locally installed

457
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,260
and properly administered firewall now

458
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,000
your users will absolutely hate you for

459
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,980
it too I know because my users hate me

460
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,440
for it I get developers who scream at me

461
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,820
all the time saying why can't I access

462
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,440
my Docker containers this McAfee

463
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,899
firewall is getting in my way I hate you

464
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,339
I don't blame them I'm getting in the

465
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,540
way of their work

466
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,399
but it's also hard to explain to them

467
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,639
well yes that's there because your kids

468
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,519
are sitting are going under weird Roblox

469
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,380
servers and joining discords or people

470
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,579
are telling them click on all these

471
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,740
links and get all the Robux and that's

472
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,480
not what's happening

473
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,579
uh you've got to make sure that all of

474
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,100
the services that people are accessing

475
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,440
are similarly secured you want to make

476
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
sure that everything is using TLS I hate

477
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,260
that it is the year 2022 and I have to

478
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
say that because everything should be

479
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,760
using TLs but there are still a number

480
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,100
of plain old HTTP services and

481
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,660
unencrypted connections that go out

482
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,600
there you have to be able to Monitor and

483
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,680
audit for that and create the

484
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,079
appropriate controls

485
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,819
um that's that's a reality

486
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,920
another another danger to consider is

487
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,860
the internet service provider being used

488
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,779
uh we have seen a lot of cases of where

489
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,160
internet service providers like to

490
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,519
harvest DNS records and sell that DNS

491
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,339
lookup data to the highest bidder

492
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,240
a it could be a case of where

493
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,339
they are hijacking index domain requests

494
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,959
and it's giving you know weird results

495
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,459
to employees

496
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,079
so this is something you know to

497
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,480
consider is are you leaking corporate

498
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,500
data

499
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,680
because of the ISP a sketchy ISP that

500
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,779
has decided we don't we don't want to

501
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,420
raise our prices for customers but we

502
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,800
will make a little extra on the side by

503
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,180
selling that data

504
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,559
so you've got to consider are you

505
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,640
protecting that kind of information too

506
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,099
uh you also need to consider that you

507
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,199
know most well-configured wireless

508
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,480
networks are using client AP isolation

509
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,939
so that it's not party mode on the

510
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,260
network where all the devices can see

511
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,179
and talk to each other I remember one

512
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,799
time I went into the Salt Lake City

513
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,179
airport and this was quite some time ago

514
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,919
and they didn't have that turned on

515
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,540
and

516
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,760
there were a lot of people who had

517
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,200
Network shares wide open to the world

518
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,419
sitting on that Network that was a

519
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,340
little scary

520
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,320
you do need to make sure that you are

521
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,940
using things that can reduce those kinds

522
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,140
of threats

523
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,860
um

524
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,380
you you could use things such as DNS

525
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,780
filtering to block a lot of malicious

526
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,740
sites

527
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,780
you can make sure that employees are

528
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,400
using a VPN connection to make sure you

529
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,020
have a trusted exit point

530
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,120
ties to the next point

531
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,280
now

532
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,480
vpns are definitely not the new hotness

533
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,600
they have not been for a long time vpns

534
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,880
are not really security vpns are

535
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,559
changing your exit Point that's the way

536
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,660
to think of them a lot of the

537
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,400
traditional thinking is oh you vp'd end

538
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,020
to the corporate Network you must be a

539
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,160
corporate employee you should have

540
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,960
access to whatever you need to

541
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,440
that's a very bad idea because again you

542
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,419
have no idea what that endpoint with the

543
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,100
VPN is talking to on the other side

544
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,240
now what can be useful for is

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,460
controlling where traffic exits

546
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,380
so for instance where I described where

547
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,539
an ISP might be harvesting your DNS

548
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,799
lookup data and selling it to the

549
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,919
highest bidder a VPN can send all that

550
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,780
DNS query data through your network

551
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,820
instead so that you know

552
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,580
that network is not going to steal that

553
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,080
information it's not hijacking that

554
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,320
information it's not redirecting a

555
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,940
common site to a malicious endpoint you

556
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,679
don't have any DNS poisoning

557
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,380
uh for us we are using some DNS

558
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,240
filtering from infoblox that allows us

559
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,860
to block a lot of malicious domains too

560
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,299
which is very helpful

561
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,280
so it definitely cuts down on the threat

562
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,500
landscape there

563
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,440
uh one downside to that approach is you

564
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
have to think about the amount of

565
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,960
traffic that you are now going to create

566
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,660
on your local exit point

567
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,640
instead of just you know the corporate

568
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,080
Network comes in to hit your internal

569
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,460
resources now everybody's internet

570
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,679
traffic is going through there

571
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,840
we are currently using a split tunnel

572
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,440
VPN of where corporate traffic comes

573
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,059
with a VPN and all the internet traffic

574
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,740
goes to the user's Home Connection it's

575
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,900
kind of a Best of Both Worlds but again

576
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,980
you're trading a little bit of

577
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,580
protection there in order to save on

578
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,400
your outbound data costs so there's a

579
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,660
lot of trade-offs involved there but

580
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,860
that's that's kind of the point of

581
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,720
security is you look at the trade-offs

582
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,900
you evaluate which one is going to be

583
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,860
the least bad option

584
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,340
foreign

585
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,600
so you want to make sure that you're

586
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,678
using a lot of filtering

587
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,660
DNS and URL filtering are very powerful

588
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,500
security tools

589
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,160
that's that's just baby Yoda

590
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,419
so

591
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,360
uh you know DNS filtering has become

592
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,039
very popular and it's popular for a

593
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,559
reason it is extremely lightweight it's

594
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,419
not terribly expensive and it's

595
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,400
extremely effective at taking care of

596
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,059
problems with with malicious sites

597
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,460
um with most of the platforms allow you

598
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,080
to choose what types of content you're

599
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,020
going to block so you can stick to just

600
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,419
the dangerous stuff if you need to block

601
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,940
policy violating

602
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,500
um you know things such as violence or

603
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,820
pornography you have those options

604
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,140
available to you

605
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,299
uh we have found that it is

606
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,200
exceptionally powerful for be for being

607
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,419
non-intrusive to the user it really

608
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,919
doesn't have much of a performance

609
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
impact to them most of the complaints we

610
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,620
get are sites that have been improperly

611
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,539
classified

612
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,640
um an example we we decided well we're

613
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,200
going to go ahead and block Park domains

614
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
because everybody knows Park domains are

615
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,559
kind of suspicious someone's got a

616
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,880
domain they aren't posting anything on

617
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,919
it there are surprising number of

618
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,360
businesses who register a domain and

619
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
only do email on it and we don't have

620
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
the ability in infoblox to set a

621
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,299
separate policy in our email servers so

622
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,340
when we're sending an email to one of

623
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,559
these vendors that put their domain on a

624
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,880
park domain

625
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,320
what do you think happens when we go

626
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,179
searching for an MX record

627
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,580
we get nothing and the outbound email

628
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,820
fails and everyone gets very angry so

629
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,679
you do have to be careful with your DNS

630
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,660
filtering but it can be extremely

631
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,120
powerful at the same time we have found

632
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,080
that it has it is exposed some botnet

633
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,059
infections that were floating out there

634
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,480
we have been able to stop some some

635
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,220
ransomware beaconing we have cut down

636
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,159
drastically on the amount of scammy ads

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,360
that come up

638
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
uh I can't tell how many times users

639
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,380
Open tickets to say oh Chrome is telling

640
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,539
me that I need to update McAfee well no

641
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,380
no no that's wrong don't do that

642
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,260
uh this this particular platform does

643
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,120
have an endpoint agent I know you really

644
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,039
wanted a 14th endpoint agent in all of

645
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,840
your workstations

646
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,500
um

647
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,179
there are endpoint products that have

648
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,280
some URL filtering that you can layer on

649
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,380
top if DNS is not enough if you need to

650
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,360
filter out just carving out portions of

651
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,820
websites that one does tend to be a

652
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,840
little bit heavy and it's a little

653
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,580
harder to manage it's a lot of work I've

654
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,340
found that DNS filtering strikes a very

655
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,799
good balance there that gives users who

656
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,500
are remote a lot of protection uh when

657
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,240
they are when they're not on the

658
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,960
corporate Network anymore

659
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,460
firewalls of course are an essential

660
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,200
piece of equipment

661
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,919
um

662
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,539
you are still going to need to have them

663
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,340
software firewalls certainly have come a

664
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,559
long way it is I imagine there are

665
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,760
enough people old enough here to

666
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
remember Zone alarm from way way back in

667
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,200
the day before Windows XP actually had a

668
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,900
workable firewall built in there

669
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,480
uh there those those early ones are

670
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,980
really terrible they cause all sorts of

671
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,600
performance problems you've got pop-ups

672
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,700
Galore

673
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,500
these days you could get a lot of very

674
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,120
powerful results out of the built-in

675
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,100
Windows Firewall and it even has a lot

676
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,299
of centralized management through

677
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,220
Microsoft's InTune platform

678
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,020
a lot of third parties can also

679
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,460
administer that for you if you already

680
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,380
have a platform that does that

681
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,919
and you absolutely should be managing it

682
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,820
you want to make sure you have those

683
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,440
kinds of proactive controls in there you

684
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,000
want to make sure that you're saying Hey

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,760
by default block inbound SMB connections

686
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,980
nobody needs to connect to an smv share

687
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,600
on a user device

688
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,240
for any reason anymore

689
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,500
um

690
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,020
you want to make sure that the endpoint

691
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,600
firewall is configured so that if it is

692
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,460
on a malicious Network all that

693
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,460
traffic's just bouncing right off of it

694
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,080
um you know as I mentioned our developer

695
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,700
our software developers are constantly

696
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,080
trying to open ports left to right and

697
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,360
center and they'll be angry about that

698
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,220
but you know it's a protection we need

699
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,620
to have for those users we are able to

700
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,720
give them some of the ability to manage

701
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,940
some of their own firewall settings and

702
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,860
so we've created this carve off and

703
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,500
you're thinking oh well they're creating

704
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,919
exposure it is but you have to again

705
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,559
you're considering the trade-off here of

706
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
do we need people to be able to do their

707
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,620
jobs

708
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,500
as securely as they can and if you're

709
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,760
getting in the way of them doing their

710
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,679
jobs it doesn't matter how secure it is

711
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,760
you're not suiting the business need

712
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,780
anymore that's not what information

713
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,940
security is all about

714
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,080
and you want to make sure that you have

715
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,760
good centralized management of all this

716
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,320
you want to be able to tell the glance

717
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,720
you know do people have the policies

718
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,179
that we need them to have if for the

719
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,740
people who we've entrusted to manage the

720
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,780
policies are we auditing them and make

721
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,159
sure making sure they're doing same

722
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,419
things with that control that we've

723
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,220
given them do we make sure that they

724
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,919
have the right control

725
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,600
these are all important questions to be

726
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,880
asking especially because you don't have

727
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,860
an I.T person just down the hall for

728
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,699
many of these people anymore

729
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,120
so when I got my corporate laptop one of

730
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,860
the first things I did was I hooked it

731
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,419
up to my network printer at home because

732
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
there's nothing worse than copying a

733
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,320
document to a thumb drive plugging it

734
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
into my home system and printing from

735
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,159
there it's very inconvenient

736
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,720
one thing I did learn very quickly is

737
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,340
that the brother utility that comes with

738
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,679
it likes to be very very chatty when

739
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,419
searching for DNS entries it is

740
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,460
constantly looking for the name of the

741
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,000
printer dot whatever DNS suffixes are in

742
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,919
my network connection list and my

743
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,440
corporate laptop has about 20 of them

744
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,539
so you can imagine when I go and look at

745
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,880
my DNS query logs it is an absolute

746
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,000
mountain of queries just looking for my

747
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,960
printer

748
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,179
it's about five percent of my total DNS

749
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,820
queries on my network no lie

750
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,080
um

751
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
but this is an interesting question is

752
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,400
do you know what systems your user

753
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
workstations are talking to

754
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640
you probably don't have that visibility

755
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,320
it would be nice to have that visibility

756
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,200
because again you just plop that down in

757
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,700
a hostile environment

758
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,679
who's trying to talk to it who is it

759
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,880
trying to talk to

760
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,100
if you're going through that centralized

761
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,980
DNS then you've at least got an idea of

762
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,900
who it may be talking to

763
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,760
but you also want to make sure that

764
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,620
you're looking at that kind of stuff

765
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,120
um

766
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,820
you know I I am uh you know a good

767
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,860
example here is I'm I'm using run zero

768
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,779
at home uh they're free tier to do scans

769
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,240
on my home network and I am certain that

770
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,039
those scans hitting my corporate laptop

771
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,500
probably look really suspicious because

772
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,880
it's poke it and prodded and doing

773
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,320
everything it can to fingerprint that

774
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,779
device and tell me what's running on it

775
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,179
how do you identify something that's not

776
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,100
malicious like that versus an actively

777
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,559
malicious attack like it's coming from

778
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
another system on that Network it'd be

779
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,039
pretty hard to tell

780
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,659
um if you don't know run zero was

781
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,659
created by the creator of Metasploit so

782
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,400
it's using the exact same techniques

783
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,679
that can be uh that can look pretty

784
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,059
scary to someone who doesn't know what's

785
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,860
happening there

786
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,720
um you're going to see other window

787
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,580
systems on the network are going to be

788
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,620
chatting with it over SMB to say hey

789
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,720
what network shares you got what are you

790
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,039
what are you hosting there let me talk

791
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,880
to it

792
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,559
remember that home network is a flat

793
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,240
Network space a dangerous Network space

794
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,460
and everyone wants to talk to everyone

795
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,919
they're very social

796
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
and then you've got all of the you know

797
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,659
garbage devices on there doing it too so

798
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,760
it becomes it become very noisy you've

799
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,200
got a lot of background radiation you

800
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,059
have to try and filter through a lot

801
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,740
more than if that laptop is sitting in

802
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,240
your office where you don't have the

803
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,220
same level of background radiation or

804
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,419
you at least know what it is when you

805
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:19,679
see it

806
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
you want to try and avoid the alert

807
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,460
fatigue that comes with that you know

808
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,840
you don't want to run around hair on

809
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,299
fire just because somebody's got you

810
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,159
know a very bad webcam there that won't

811
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,500
shut up

812
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,940
you also need to look for those

813
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,919
potential Insider threats

814
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,600
um you know thinking if I'm an attacker

815
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,340
and I wanted to like really you know

816
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,559
weasel my way into a network I wouldn't

817
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,900
go trying to beat down the the castle

818
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
walls

819
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,720
I would be trying to find the remote

820
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
employee and use the hijack their system

821
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,659
and piggyback on their their access get

822
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,299
into the VPN that way

823
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,880
it really highlights that the protecting

824
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,620
the endpoints has become far more

825
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,879
important than it has ever been

826
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,380
but

827
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,200
everybody hates endpoint

828
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,940
these are your users when you install

829
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,100
endpoint on their system

830
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,919
they I have never heard so much weeping

831
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,659
wailing and gnashing in teeth as I have

832
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,059
about endpoint and ninety percent of the

833
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,039
time when someone says it's endpoint

834
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,820
it's not in point

835
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,140
they would much rather listen to Yoko

836
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,179
Ono doing Nickelback covers than deal

837
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,140
with it EDR

838
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,460
when a user opens a ticket and says that

839
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,500
and I see that they're missing endpoint

840
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,440
they ghost me the second I ask how come

841
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,220
you don't have that installed

842
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,840
and the reality is it's really hard to

843
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,240
fix that problem you can't go down to

844
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,120
their desk and say move and do it for

845
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,380
them

846
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,779
so this this raises questions about how

847
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,159
are you Distributing and maintaining

848
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,840
that endpoint software that's that's

849
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,179
going to be a big challenge

850
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,559
um you know we are an SCCM shop and SCCM

851
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,860
you know works pretty well but you need

852
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,260
to get on VPN to get those updates

853
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,820
and believe it or not there are a lot of

854
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,159
people who just don't

855
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,960
what do you do when a workstation stock

856
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,580
when a workstation's endpoint stops

857
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,840
talking

858
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,820
how do you get in and fix it

859
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,340
you don't have a way to force the issue

860
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,919
you can try some Remote Management tools

861
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,080
to try and get in there

862
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,460
you know how are you going to handle

863
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,020
these situations we actually have a lot

864
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,480
of endpoints where they break it's not

865
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,919
because the user did anything it's just

866
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,659
because software software is trash

867
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,760
software just breaks and you never know

868
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
why sometimes

869
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,240
and you almost all reinstall it

870
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,520
everything's happy as can be you have to

871
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,380
be able to identify that

872
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,600
so you do need to make sure that you can

873
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,059
establish a beachhead on these systems

874
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,059
we do take a few a few approaches to

875
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,320
make sure that we have those endpoint

876
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,480
Beach heads the most important of that

877
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,340
is making sure that it's always rolled

878
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,399
into your standard corporate images

879
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,559
um unfortunately we have a lot of users

880
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,000
who seem to think it's a good idea to

881
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
wipe the corporate image and put their

882
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,059
own copy of Windows on there

883
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,299
and they don't end up having that stuff

884
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,520
plenty of people think that's a great

885
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,100
idea uh but having it there is an

886
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,260
assumed default sharply reduces any

887
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,700
installation failures that come from

888
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,460
other other methods uh the next line of

889
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,840
defense is making sure that we get it

890
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,880
installed via SCCM if it's missing we're

891
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,279
Distributing updates that way

892
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,120
um

893
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,679
we

894
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,179
unfortunately have to have them connect

895
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,919
to the VPN for a number of consecutive

896
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,480
hours in order for that to work but

897
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,159
management platforms are getting better

898
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,500
Microsoft InTune is one of those Cloud

899
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,860
native ones that handles it for you

900
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,360
platforms now oftentimes can say to the

901
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,580
endpoints hey update

902
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,260
you know from our from our Cloud

903
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,720
repository instead

904
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,980
uh

905
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,500
and that's that really makes a lot of uh

906
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,480
that really really makes a lot of

907
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,940
difference I I'll tell you right now uh

908
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,320
there are a lot of endpoint solutions

909
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
that are still pushing on-prem

910
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,320
management servers

911
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,720
please avoid them they are they're so

912
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,700
much more trouble than they're worth you

913
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,340
have to try and establish dmz's and you

914
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,080
have traffic flowing in and out of the

915
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,220
firewall and it's it's far more trouble

916
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,140
than you want to deal with

917
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,580
uh

918
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,260
and even though we have all of these

919
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,419
automated systems and management systems

920
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,399
for Distributing it we're still having

921
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,260
to put installers on a SharePoint site

922
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,720
for people to go download them from you

923
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,279
you got to have those fallbacks you got

924
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,020
to have the layers there of how do we

925
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,059
get this out there

926
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,520
if you're covering 95 or more of your

927
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,840
systems you're actually doing pretty

928
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,500
good so if you think oh man 96 I am

929
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,039
trash no no that's your top tier

930
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:47,299
give yourself a pat on the back

931
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
so congratulations all of your endpoint

932
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,480
agents are installed

933
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,399
are they working

934
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,260
do you have any idea that they're

935
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,940
working

936
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,919
so as a minimum Baseline you need to

937
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,720
check to see if they are checking in and

938
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,940
talking back to you or not

939
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,500
um there are amazing number of times

940
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,080
where a user workstation is fine but the

941
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,880
endpoint software for whatever reason

942
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,980
just said you know I'm just not going to

943
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,140
phone home to the Mothership anymore

944
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,000
this problem of course gets harder at

945
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,080
scale

946
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,159
um

947
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,840
you know what we've established is kind

948
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,460
of a good cut off is that we look at

949
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,080
endpoints that have been silent for a

950
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,360
month and then we have to do all sorts

951
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,039
of reporting and cross-checking to make

952
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,039
sure that the systems have actually uh

953
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,679
actually no longer there and this is

954
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,899
going to get hard

955
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,539
anyone who has a cmdv a system inventory

956
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,539
that you're proud of raise your hand

957
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,500
good there's no Liars in this room

958
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,580
I don't either

959
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,440
I have a cobbled together mess that

960
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,480
gives us kind of an idea of if endpoints

961
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,860
are still out there or not

962
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,520
and it is uh it is quite a it's a mess

963
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,279
of python and API calls and a SQL

964
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,799
database and a reporting platform to try

965
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,740
and figure out what's going on there

966
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,240
um you know our default is that after a

967
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,460
month we say if we haven't seen it for a

968
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,120
month and the system has been removed

969
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,000
from SCCM we're pretty sure it's gone

970
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,380
now and we can prune those and get the

971
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,600
licenses back license management is

972
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,860
going to be a real problem with your

973
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,000
de-provisioning you want to make sure

974
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,419
your de-provisioning processes are good

975
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,440
um

976
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,299
users will definitely let you know when

977
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,340
a policy gets in the way of their work

978
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,019
so that can give you an idea of whether

979
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,840
or not it's working properly I I'll give

980
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,399
you some examples of user tickets that

981
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,899
people have actually opened with us and

982
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,179
I swear I'm not making any of these up

983
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,340
one user opened a ticket with us because

984
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,799
they said hey I'm trying to install Blue

985
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,679
Iris on my laptop and it's not working

986
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,000
for those of you that don't know blue

987
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,679
iris is a camera server for storing all

988
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,019
of your network camera footage

989
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,600
why would you need that on a user laptop

990
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,279
apparently they had the great idea of

991
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,200
well I have my use I have my workstation

992
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,519
here and I'm not really using it all

993
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,080
that much I'll just have all my home

994
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,000
cameras record to it

995
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,480
what

996
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,940
we've had people who have been

997
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,699
attempting to install the latest Forza

998
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,800
game on their system

999
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,418
why you would attempt to run that on an

1000
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,060
integrated GPU is beyond me

1001
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,859
but apparently someone was really hard

1002
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,779
up in their need for a racing game

1003
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,980
I think everyone has had to deal with

1004
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,159
the scourge of TeamViewer right

1005
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,659
so many users are trying to install

1006
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,580
those Remote Management tools on there

1007
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,339
that have horrible security problems are

1008
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,139
unauthorized

1009
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,580
and

1010
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,500
we are we are constantly looking for

1011
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,359
what are these things that should not be

1012
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,300
running and and to continually

1013
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,119
work on those policies we've had to

1014
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,460
create new policies based on user needs

1015
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,320
that come up you have to make sure that

1016
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,119
you have this continuous feedback loop

1017
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,800
because

1018
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,359
sometimes when things aren't working

1019
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,400
people will just Grumble about it and

1020
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,260
you don't really hear about it in an

1021
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
office setting eventually that grumbling

1022
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,260
comes back to you

1023
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,420
but if everyone's remote maybe you don't

1024
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,980
hear about that crumpling and so you

1025
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,300
have to be you have to take a much more

1026
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,980
proactive approach approach to being

1027
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,940
able to manage that

1028
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,300
so you will have endpoint agents that

1029
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,160
just stop checking in

1030
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,020
and sometimes you're going to find out

1031
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,060
that the employee is no longer with the

1032
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,440
company and their laptop has been sent

1033
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,700
back

1034
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,200
other times you'll see the employees

1035
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,119
with the company and it just stopped

1036
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,500
working

1037
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,880
and this is where things get really

1038
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,640
tricky is because usually unless the

1039
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,960
endpoint's causing a problem for the

1040
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,520
user they're not going to tell you that

1041
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,900
there's a problem because they don't

1042
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,240
know that there's a problem

1043
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
and you have to be able to

1044
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,099
you have to be able to figure out you

1045
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,780
know when they stop working and have a

1046
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,339
process in place for being able to fix

1047
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,800
them right now with us that's reaching

1048
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,180
out to our managed service provider and

1049
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,680
opening tickets with them and saying hey

1050
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,680
please go fix this endpoint

1051
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,380
remember users they hate endpoint like

1052
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,320
Russian tanks hate Ukrainian tractors

1053
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,240
they will fake their death and start

1054
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,800
working under an assumed identity if

1055
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,619
that's what it takes to avoid it

1056
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,180
and it's not like you can walk over to

1057
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,160
their desk and tell them that you have

1058
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,320
to do it now our decommissioning process

1059
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
is also a challenge because we don't get

1060
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
a notification from HR when somebody

1061
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,660
gets off-boarded

1062
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,000
do any of you get a notification from HR

1063
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,320
when your people leave

1064
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,300
good you have good processes I see most

1065
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,220
of you have your hands down and so you

1066
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,480
know this pain

1067
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
and so when a system just stops checking

1068
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,960
in on everything

1069
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,420
you don't know what's happening is the

1070
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,420
employee out on FMLA leave are they

1071
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,579
taking a very long vacation

1072
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,619
did they take a very long vacation to

1073
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,780
Switzerland with a pile of company money

1074
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,940
you have no idea

1075
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,400
and so I talked earlier about what I've

1076
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,380
done to try and address this and I've

1077
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,420
effectively built a shadow cmdb that

1078
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,800
tracks this

1079
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,140
it's using API calls from our endpoint

1080
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,660
products some email reports that come

1081
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,700
from other divisions of the company a

1082
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,400
bunch of Python scripts Learn Python you

1083
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,140
need to know python

1084
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,540
a postgres database and we're using a

1085
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,240
reporting platform called redash and so

1086
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,740
we're ingesting all of our data from

1087
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,180
carbon black McAfee qualis SCCM and AD

1088
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,500
and as well as some reporting from our

1089
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,700
ticketing system

1090
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,060
and from this I could create a list of

1091
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,339
here endpoints I think are gone it's not

1092
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:29,160
an SCCM anymore 80 thinks it's inactive

1093
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,200
hasn't checked in any endpoint agent for

1094
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,420
30 days which helps us go in and clean

1095
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,760
it up because again you don't want to

1096
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,140
pay for licenses you're not using that's

1097
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,400
money that you would probably rather

1098
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,359
spend on something else

1099
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,079
and when you're in these risk

1100
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,820
environments you're going to be

1101
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,579
dealing with alert overload if you don't

1102
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,140
tune these things correctly because

1103
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,780
again you're in hostile environments

1104
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,520
you want to make sure that you have

1105
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,140
really good filtering in place of all of

1106
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,579
these alerts because otherwise you can

1107
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,320
go absolutely nuts

1108
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,920
um

1109
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,599
you know for instance

1110
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,200
you could see a system that is making a

1111
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,940
bunch of DNS queries to a suspicious

1112
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,240
domain and you're like oh man that must

1113
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,339
be really bad and then you find out oh

1114
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,380
this is the employee's personal domain

1115
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,640
and they're just running next Cloud on

1116
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,960
it to try and sync stuff instead of

1117
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,020
using the company approved OneDrive

1118
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,700
but you need to be able to handle those

1119
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,020
alerts because you're going to generate

1120
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,460
a lot more alerts in these hostile

1121
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,359
environments that you're going to

1122
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,160
generate in your office

1123
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,720
you don't want to create alert fatigue

1124
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,760
everyone in this room I'm sure has alert

1125
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,440
fatigue you're already getting too many

1126
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,760
emails you're already getting too many

1127
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,380
slack messages you're already getting

1128
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,160
you know too many pager Duty messages

1129
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,200
and so you want to make sure that you

1130
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,960
have good filtering to

1131
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,579
wrong way you want to make sure you have

1132
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,099
good filtering that can pare down those

1133
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,660
alerts make sure that you're not getting

1134
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,880
too many of them if you can you want to

1135
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,500
have some automatic remediation of these

1136
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,160
alerts and you can

1137
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,880
and

1138
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,800
one of the best things that you can do

1139
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,320
is work with your tool vendors

1140
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,060
you probably some of you probably

1141
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,440
already know but a lot of you may not

1142
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,900
your tool vendors actually will do a lot

1143
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,160
for you

1144
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,800
carbon black once a year will do a

1145
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,900
health check report for us they go

1146
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,099
through the environment and they come up

1147
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,320
with recommendations to say hey here's

1148
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,520
how you could be using the product

1149
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,900
better

1150
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,280
that's free

1151
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,380
it's already included why would you not

1152
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,579
have someone who knows the product

1153
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:27,839
inside and out tell you how you could

1154
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,880
use it better you absolutely should make

1155
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,040
use of those kinds of resources I know

1156
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,119
what you're thinking of I already have

1157
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,500
too much to do I don't have time to act

1158
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
on that well that's

1159
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
that's one of the big problems that that

1160
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,900
is seen in EDR is that there's so many

1161
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,119
alerts that they don't get triaged for

1162
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,500
weeks or months

1163
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
but some of the some of the automation

1164
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,220
is really going to help with that uh you

1165
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,780
also should make use of training

1166
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,099
resources for the tools that you have

1167
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,960
available to you you'd be amazed how

1168
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,400
many people never read the documentation

1169
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,839
for these things

1170
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,460
nobody goes and reads the knowledge base

1171
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,460
articles nobody goes and reads the P the

1172
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,800
300 Page PDFs that say here's how things

1173
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,060
operate

1174
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,320
but those are a wealth of information

1175
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,960
and I know it's more than you have time

1176
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,040
to do

1177
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,700
but when you but when you do that you're

1178
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,400
going to actually reduce your workload

1179
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,960
and because you are increasing your

1180
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,460
alerts you need to make sure that you

1181
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,320
have invested heavily in that kind of

1182
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,180
Automation and that kind of filtering

1183
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,180
otherwise you are going to continue to

1184
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,079
drown

1185
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,480
my goal is to be in charge of automating

1186
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,980
processes

1187
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,359
I don't want to be sitting there

1188
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,280
remediating every alert I want the

1189
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,660
computer to do the work for me that's

1190
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,520
what it's there for it is there for

1191
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,560
those boring repetitive manual tasks

1192
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,940
that you hate to do

1193
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,060
so you should make the computer do those

1194
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,099
if you're not sure how to get started

1195
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,020
with doing any sort of automation there

1196
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,240
are a lot of great resources out there I

1197
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,700
would strongly recommend learning one or

1198
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,500
more scripting languages

1199
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,720
it could be python my favorite it could

1200
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,579
be Powershell Powershell is really great

1201
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,020
don't let it put you off because it's a

1202
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,339
Microsoft product

1203
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,339
bash is even perfectly adequate for a

1204
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,260
lot of cases we'll make fun of it

1205
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,599
because it's so Tinker toy but it's not

1206
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,000
stupid if it works

1207
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,920
it also helps to know a little bit of

1208
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,599
SQL

1209
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,280
there are a lot of really cool things

1210
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,680
that you can do in Excel but let me tell

1211
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,900
you I have shown people what I've done

1212
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,460
with some SQL queries that are Excel

1213
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,140
Wizards and their jaws dropped so like

1214
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,880
wow that is so much easier it really is

1215
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,960
these are some things that I would

1216
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,760
strongly recommend a great way to get

1217
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,320
started with learning API calls for

1218
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,359
automation is using Postman

1219
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,520
uh Postman is free

1220
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,940
you can fill out fields to give it like

1221
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,560
the URL that you're talking to the

1222
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,119
various values you need to pass like

1223
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,280
your authorization token and it will

1224
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,980
even give you the code in whatever

1225
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,079
language you want of how to do it

1226
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,359
so you punch in everything and you say

1227
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,640
you know what Postman I've told you how

1228
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,560
to do this API call show me how to do it

1229
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,480
in Python it gives you the python script

1230
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,700
do you have a starting point you can you

1231
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,040
can see how it works

1232
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,599
um this is a good way to get things

1233
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,020
started

1234
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:07,980
so we've talked about the challenges of

1235
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,960
securing the employee workspace Network

1236
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,420
and device and now we have a bigger

1237
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,760
problem which is that after all that

1238
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,859
nonsense they still somehow have to get

1239
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,440
into corporate resources to do their job

1240
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,960
the most secure computer is one that is

1241
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,579
turned off and cased in cement and

1242
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,900
dropped in the bottom of the Marianas

1243
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,480
Trench it's also not very useful

1244
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,800
not unless you're in the boat anchor

1245
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,040
business

1246
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,020
so if you're a newer company some of the

1247
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,760
best advice I can give to you is

1248
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,619
building Cloud first because you don't

1249
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,240
have to consider access to on-prem

1250
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,040
resources

1251
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,140
for all of the rest of us which I'm

1252
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,420
pretty sure is most of us we have to

1253
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,160
figure out how are we going to get

1254
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,040
people that virtual access that we need

1255
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,400
so VPN is still very popular for this

1256
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,000
um

1257
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,560
you know that's quickly becoming

1258
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,920
dispavored for a number of reasons

1259
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,440
um a lot of vpns are incurring about a

1260
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,599
40 to 50 performance hit right off the

1261
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,599
top if you're using like openvpn

1262
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:07,319
um

1263
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,000
unless you're fancy and have something

1264
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,500
that's wire guard based which I'm

1265
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,420
guessing is not a lot of people

1266
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,339
that's gonna you're gonna look at those

1267
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,079
kinds of performance problems

1268
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,660
they're also building about about the

1269
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,760
Aging models of well once you've gotten

1270
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,520
past the door you're okay and really you

1271
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,859
need to have you know a lot of

1272
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,780
continuous authentication to make sure

1273
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,400
that things stay okay

1274
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,520
uh we are starting you know you have to

1275
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,440
also configure a lot of firewalls to

1276
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,300
allow traffic to moving between Network

1277
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,160
segments from wherever your VPN endpoint

1278
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,140
is on your network that gets complex

1279
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,520
very fast

1280
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,619
uh we're actually implementing fire mod

1281
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:45,359
to have a single place to view and edit

1282
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,300
our our firewall configurations

1283
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,180
um which is great for our Network

1284
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,579
Engineers because it's convenient but it

1285
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,020
also creates that Crown Jewel an

1286
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,940
attacker might want to come after

1287
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,460
so again if we reduce our run-firm

1288
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,680
resources then we reduce the value of

1289
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
that it's one of the reasons I recommend

1290
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,540
going hosted and we call it Cloud first

1291
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,119
foreign

1292
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,619
tication continues to be a pretty thorny

1293
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,140
problem when you used to be able to see

1294
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,119
remote authentication attempts that was

1295
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,920
something that set off in a flag by

1296
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,099
itself 10 years ago 15 years ago someone

1297
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,780
was trying to come in remotely look at a

1298
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,760
lot more closely because there was a lot

1299
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,240
less of that traffic but now it's most

1300
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,119
of the traffic it's all the traffic

1301
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,560
and you also have to consider things

1302
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,940
like where the authentication is coming

1303
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,880
from if your U.S based employee suddenly

1304
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
logs in from Singapore three hours after

1305
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,260
they locked off you probably should

1306
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,480
notice and do something about that

1307
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,700
but on the flip side if they logged in

1308
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,079
from home yesterday and from a Florida

1309
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,579
beach tomorrow

1310
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,680
that that seems plausible doesn't it

1311
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,060
they're remote they can work from the

1312
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,900
beach

1313
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,440
their laptop might not work after that

1314
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,020
Legacy authentication platforms do make

1315
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,760
this really hard

1316
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,119
um because a lot of them are very simple

1317
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,740
user password and maybe you have some

1318
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,599
sort of you know multi-factor going on

1319
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,640
there but a lot of modern authentication

1320
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,619
platforms are really helping to sort out

1321
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,480
a lot of these challenges that occur of

1322
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,599
you can't use the location reliably as

1323
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:20,220
an indicator of whether or not it's

1324
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,119
legit

1325
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,020
so there's a lot of them like Ping OCTA

1326
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,240
Azure ad you're giving up a little bit

1327
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,520
of control of your authentication but

1328
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,440
they have a lot of really great tools

1329
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,300
there that can really help you out with

1330
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,540
that and I hate to pitch tools because a

1331
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,920
lot of this a lot of security is

1332
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,380
processed but you need tools to automate

1333
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,940
some of these things that would take

1334
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,740
humans forever to do it would take an

1335
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,599
implausible number of people to look at

1336
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,160
every authentication attempt and say

1337
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,060
okay okay no okay no there's there's not

1338
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,520
enough people in the world

1339
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,220
and many orgs a lot of you were probably

1340
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,900
tying back to active directory still I

1341
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,720
think pretty much everyone is uh

1342
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,180
I mean I I work for microfocus we owe

1343
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,040
Novell and we use ad

1344
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,220
what does that tell you

1345
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,339
but uh your ad infrastructure is pretty

1346
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,380
likely to be a museum as much as it is a

1347
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,880
current record isn't it

1348
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,819
do you ever clean up your ad

1349
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,319
do you still have workstations in there

1350
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,180
that are 25 years old as old as a

1351
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,440
company

1352
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,700
probably

1353
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,680
is everybody scared to delete things

1354
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,060
when they aren't sure if they're being

1355
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,099
used anymore

1356
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,140
do you still have a system in your

1357
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,000
corner running Solaris 8 and nobody

1358
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,260
wants to unplug it because you're

1359
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,579
certain that if you do it'll break

1360
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:37,440
something critical

1361
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,200
yeah yeah you are and that's that is a

1362
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,060
problem there because you have all of

1363
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,880
this junk in there

1364
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,099
and it's your source of truth but it's

1365
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,500
full of lies

1366
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,760
so you need to make sure that you're

1367
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,260
cleaning up your group memberships that

1368
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,240
you're deactivating your user and

1369
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
service accounts yes you need to make

1370
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,319
sure your service accounts are taken

1371
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,599
care of in a timely manner you'd have a

1372
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,920
plan to remove these things that are no

1373
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,900
longer used because

1374
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,700
these authentication credentials are not

1375
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,960
just people hopping around on the

1376
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,520
network these are people knocking on the

1377
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,020
front door saying little pig little pig

1378
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,400
let me in

1379
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,839
keep that big bad wolf at Bay

1380
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,140
you and certainly you know I an identity

1381
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,579
governance platform is something that

1382
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,140
can be very helpful I supported one of

1383
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,540
them at RSA microfocus sells one I'm not

1384
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,640
here to vendor pitch you

1385
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,260
um and it's hard to get budget for tools

1386
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,880
but let me tell you

1387
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,160
when they work they can do the work of

1388
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,500
10 system administrators

1389
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,579
um

1390
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,680
what I've seen and this is this is an

1391
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,780
incredible thing to watch a user gets

1392
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,599
onboarded in the HR platform the

1393
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,240
governance platform sees it and they

1394
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,680
automatically provision all the accounts

1395
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,140
that employee needs in one Fell Swoop

1396
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,880
gives them all of the group memberships

1397
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,440
they need based on their job title and

1398
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,000
their manager and their location and

1399
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,839
everything

1400
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:56,940
completely automated

1401
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,859
they change job positions that

1402
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,140
information comes in again all of it is

1403
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,839
done automated the user is terminated

1404
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,520
all of their stuff is shut down

1405
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,079
automated nobody's hunting through

1406
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,400
systems trying to find all those

1407
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,900
leftover accounts

1408
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,940
I know it's hard to justify budget for

1409
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,319
those kinds of systems because we all

1410
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,180
operate under budgets we all are trying

1411
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,619
to not spend money

1412
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:17,880
but when you look at the kind of return

1413
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,380
on investment you get on those kinds of

1414
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,839
platforms especially with the kinds of

1415
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,359
mushrooming access you have it's it's

1416
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,760
very much worth it

1417
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,260
so you need to make sure that you're

1418
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,660
controlling that another challenge we've

1419
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,660
run into is the shared password problem

1420
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,060
yes you should not share your passwords

1421
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,099
realistically some vendor hands you a

1422
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:39,780
Linux Appliance and it has a root

1423
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,220
password on it and you have multiple

1424
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,660
people who need to access it right

1425
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,579
you're going to have shared credentials

1426
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,200
that's

1427
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,420
that's the way it is

1428
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,280
and so you want to make sure that you

1429
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,200
have some sort of password manager

1430
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,640
available for employees that could

1431
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,020
handle those kinds of situations you

1432
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,400
want to be able to store their passwords

1433
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,900
they need to be able to share those

1434
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,280
passwords and those shared Secrets

1435
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,460
things like API tokens maybe you need to

1436
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,140
share license keys

1437
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,420
you want to make sure that you know

1438
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,220
we're using LastPass I don't

1439
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,780
particularly care for it I like bit

1440
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,640
warden for my own uses but something

1441
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,020
like that is something you really need

1442
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,640
to have around because passwords are not

1443
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,200
going away anytime anytime soon

1444
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,060
I've also mentioned zero trust models is

1445
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,800
applied to networks where you assume all

1446
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,480
networks are hospital that's scratching

1447
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,339
the surface you need to make sure that

1448
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,040
you are continually making sure that

1449
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,180
someone is doing what they're supposed

1450
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,200
to be doing

1451
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,400
if you have a developer that starts

1452
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,740
poking around your financial systems

1453
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,359
would you think that's weird especially

1454
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,339
if they don't do anything regarding your

1455
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,079
financial systems

1456
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,520
so maybe you want to do a step up

1457
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,140
authentication on them and make sure hey

1458
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,720
are you actually who you say you are

1459
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,220
because you don't know who it is you

1460
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,540
don't know if it's an attacker that's

1461
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,220
exploiting access you don't know if it's

1462
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,599
an Insider threat you don't know if it's

1463
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,339
a board employee just like hey what's

1464
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,440
that system do

1465
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,900
uh you should I would recommend getting

1466
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,400
familiar with those zero trust

1467
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,400
principles uh nist publication 800-207

1468
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,980
has uh the gist of it it's really great

1469
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,560
there's three main thrusts to it you

1470
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,420
have to have continuous Authentication

1471
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,520
always double check make sure who

1472
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,900
someone is don't have that initial

1473
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,760
username and password be the end-all be

1474
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,020
all

1475
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,160
second you need to make sure you're

1476
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,380
containing the blast radius

1477
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,660
um you know you want to make sure that

1478
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,480
everything's treated hostile

1479
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,099
and third you need to make sure that you

1480
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,480
have some something something to

1481
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,920
centralize the collection of all your

1482
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,839
centralized your collection of logs and

1483
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:31,740
events

1484
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,140
uh like a seem everyone hates them

1485
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,180
they're horrible to configure they they

1486
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,880
can be a real time suck

1487
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,460
but you also can't have

1488
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,260
everyone sending all their Windows event

1489
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,119
logs from all these remote endpoints I

1490
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,800
mean what if you got a user that's

1491
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,680
sitting on CenturyLink DSL

1492
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,000
do you think they want to have half

1493
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,680
their bandwidth or more consumed by

1494
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,119
sending their Windows event logs in real

1495
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,260
time to you

1496
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,059
no you've got to consider that you've

1497
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,800
got bandwidth constraints now with all

1498
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,319
of these remote users not just the

1499
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,579
bandwidth that goes out of your office

1500
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,200
when they're on VPN but the bandwidth

1501
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,940
that they've got coming back to you you

1502
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,079
can't collect the same amount of

1503
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,160
information

1504
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,599
so you need to make sure that however

1505
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,460
you're collecting that information

1506
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,780
you're doing it in a way that will

1507
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,220
actually work with what the user has

1508
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,099
yes there are clouds in your forecast

1509
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:21,660
um I know everyone's sick of hearing

1510
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,559
about it

1511
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,180
but I will tell you right now in a

1512
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,119
remote Workforce hosted platforms are

1513
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,460
your savior we do not buy on-prem

1514
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,099
anymore we refuse to buy on-prem we are

1515
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:33,720
kicking as much as we can off to Cloud

1516
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,599
providers we are doing that because it

1517
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,640
is far easier to provision remote access

1518
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,220
and manage a distributed Workforce that

1519
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,040
way

1520
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,940
when

1521
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,160
when we first had employees going remote

1522
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,319
our Maccabee management server was on

1523
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,540
site and we had to set up port

1524
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,220
forwarding so that all of those agents

1525
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,480
could talk to us and it was a lot of

1526
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,980
traffic and instead we moved to a cloud

1527
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,140
platform and it has been way easier to

1528
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,240
manage and there's a lot less headache

1529
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,859
and you absolutely want to make sure

1530
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:03,359
that you're doing that first more than

1531
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,700
anything else

1532
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,500
I want to thank you for putting up with

1533
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,420
me for an hour I know I've made some bad

1534
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,980
jokes here but hopefully you've got

1535
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,200
something out of this presentation and I

1536
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,280
will happily accept any questions

1537
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,500
comments or rude noises

1538
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,600
foreign

1539
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:25,429
