1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
all right this is uh H is for hacking

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,380
um I'm going to talk a little bit about

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,899
uh circuit bending

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,000
um the example I have didn't really go

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,980
is I had hoped it had and so it's going

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,179
to be a little bit

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,059
more intimidating than maybe sometimes

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,580
the circuit bending can be so as I go

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,600
through here and I start talking about

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,800
things please don't be like oh wait

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,660
that's past what I can do because it's

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,680
really not

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,600
um I think anybody in here can do this

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,000
type of stuff I'm also kind of OCD with

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,460
some things and maybe I went a little

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,619
harder than I needed to I made my made a

17
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,059
little bit more difficult

18
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,500
um but I'll try to point out those

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,239
points where like you could shortcut

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,880
here and it would be a lot easier

21
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,780
um so

22
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,840
yeah that's the that's this course uh

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,620
quickly about me uh I've do a lot of re

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,360
reverse engineering stuff so that's

25
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,280
typically where I I live

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,899
um but uh

27
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,239
this is this course isn't really my like

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,620
I don't do a lot of Hardware I do some

29
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,300
hardware and physical pen test attacks

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,219
but this really isn't like this is more

31
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,000
of a hobby for me not a line of work

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
um so see exhibit a this is what I will

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
be talking about today this is the toy

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,960
that I chose to pick on I have a

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
two-year-old at home and you see this

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
nice little we call it an e-pad I don't

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,960
know what it's really called what is it

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,840
yeah its name is too long

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,700
but it's a nice little device it's got

40
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
little letters on it in each letter you

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,240
know H is four or something and then it

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,799
plays music and it lights up around the

43
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,360
edges

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,820
um but I wasn't quite satisfied with the

45
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,860
their choices of letters and what they

46
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,320
stood for you see that s anybody can

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
guess what s stands for

48
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,540
s stands for sister come on guys this is

49
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,460
like a baby's toy don't you know that s

50
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,380
stands for sister that image is clearly

51
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,360
your sister yeah it was things like that

52
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,820
I was like this toy annoys me that I'm

53
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,500
gonna replace this and so I'm going to

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
replace this as s stands for security

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,040
right and and a stands for

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
accountability or authentic or

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,180
authentication right and so that's what

58
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,680
I wanted to have I wanted to teach my

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
kid from the go like these are the terms

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,399
you need to know to make it in the cyber

61
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,560
security world like you'll be set

62
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,060
um but my goals with this is I didn't

63
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,520
want to over do it I ended up overdoing

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,260
it a little bit but um I wanted to

65
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,360
replace it with hacker themed letters

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,459
um I wanted to reuse as much as this as

67
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,140
I could right I didn't want to make my

68
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,520
own else uh PCB board with like buttons

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,020
on it because that doesn't look as cool

70
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
as this like I liked the screen I wish I

71
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,860
could change the pictures maybe I could

72
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,420
have like somebody draw over the top of

73
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,680
them but I wanted to use as much as the

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,660
frame the pieces there and wanted to

75
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,520
keep it simple I didn't want to do

76
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,319
something really crazy

77
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,959
so step one we take it apart

78
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,480
this is the inside of that there's not a

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,780
lot there in the bottom

80
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,819
right I have to look at my hands in the

81
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,760
bottom right corner is this flexible

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,680
line that comes from the screen and it's

83
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,360
got 28

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,180
uh headers on it and it's just pushed

85
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,980
against the board with a piece of foam

86
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,599
underneath it and you can see on the

87
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,879
board those gold plated pins they just

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,680
marry up and that's how it interfaces

89
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,480
with the keyboard you see a speaker

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,200
there and that PCB that PCB is one-sided

91
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
in the top right is the back side and

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
there's no traces on the back side so

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,860
that's a pretty simple looking PCB all

94
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,540
the traces are on the front I can just

95
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,099
look at it's got an LED on the corner

96
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,360
too and then you can see the wires to

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,140
the battery

98
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,840
so we're going to tear down uh we're

99
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,220
going to look at what would I need to do

100
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,560
or what could I do to attack this

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
um first maybe I want to talk back here

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,580
a little bit uh I got these in the wrong

103
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,200
word let's talk about this Black Bob

104
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,379
blob this was disappointing for me to

105
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,040
see

106
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,680
so this is called chip on board and

107
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,319
typically it's done as a cost saving

108
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,180
measure even though it turns into be a

109
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,860
really strong security measure for

110
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,900
Hardware attacks because basically this

111
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,580
chip doesn't even have a casing on it

112
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,560
it's just the tiny little part and

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,420
little fingers that are built right on

114
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,640
the PCB on production and then they

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,140
program it there and then they put the

116
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,459
blob down to protect it when it's done

117
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,920
and it's extremely hard to attack right

118
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,319
like you need to sand it down it's just

119
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,060
beyond what I was going to do for a

120
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,920
kid's toy I I don't even know if I could

121
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,780
do it if I really wanted to the attacks

122
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,120
on those are really really difficult

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,500
furthermore there's no identifying marks

124
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
so I can't even figure out what what

125
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
processor it is if I can make an attacks

126
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,358
on it that kind of limited what I could

127
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,820
do if I wanted to attack this board you

128
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,160
will find these very often on cheap

129
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,900
mass-produced things because it's

130
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,240
cheaper for the producers to use these

131
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,460
rather than complete chips that have the

132
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,259
casing and all that like it's a pennies

133
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,540
savings but like when they Mass produce

134
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,759
these those pennies add up right so

135
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
that's that means um I'm not going to be

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
able to modify this chip or like

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
reprogram it I'm going to have to come

138
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,040
up with my own chip

139
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,680
and so this is where this is my first

140
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,020
thing like oh wait I'm not gonna I'm not

141
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,280
a developer I don't do Hardware

142
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,919
development I can't do this uh yeah you

143
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,199
can it's not bad furthermore you don't

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,540
if I design my own PCB as a replacement

145
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,580
for this you don't have to do that right

146
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,500
like there's a mini there's a micro

147
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,780
adreno that would fit right inside this

148
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,979
case that you could use if you don't

149
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,419
want to do that you would just have to

150
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,820
glue it however you want but I wanted to

151
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,979
be like I want to be just right fit like

152
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,540
that board and so that's where this

153
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,759
light comes in is I wanted to reproduce

154
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,680
a board that was just like this one I

155
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,660
could fit right in its place but with my

156
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,800
own processor so that I could do

157
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
whatever I wanted

158
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,660
now PCB design again isn't that hard

159
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,160
there's plenty of talks at this

160
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,180
conference where they talk about making

161
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,340
mini badges or like intro to making your

162
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
own mini badges this is just that but on

163
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,539
the next level now you don't have a mini

164
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,220
badge design you just have a board

165
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,539
you're trying to make a copy of it's

166
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,919
really not much different so if you

167
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,180
attend I would highly recommend you

168
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,740
attend those mini badges talks and just

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,539
try making one they're not that bad it's

170
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,500
like a

171
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,560
all together maybe a 50

172
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,699
investment but it's really interesting

173
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,220
to learn and it's not hard so anyways so

174
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,479
first I want to do is I needed to get

175
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,800
the dimensions of this thing you notice

176
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,840
in the bottom right corner there's a a

177
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,940
little cut out I needed to get you need

178
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,860
to measure that and get around the screw

179
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,539
so that I can fit it right in that exact

180
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,520
same spot I also need to measure where

181
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,160
each of the little screw holes were

182
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,740
um to put the same screws in so I could

183
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,800
make it fit in the exact same spot

184
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
um so here's the MCU when I decided to

185
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
replace this with was a Raspberry Pi

186
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,639
Pico that's a really friendly hacker

187
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,500
chip because it can run circuit Python

188
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,660
and it's really cheap it costs like a

189
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,539
dollar I think it's not in Mass it's

190
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,160
like a dollar 25 it's really not bad

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,020
especially right now

192
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,880
it's really nice because there's

193
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,340
actually stock like all the Arduino

194
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,780
chips the app Mega chips they're really

195
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,160
hard to get hold of right now even still

196
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,919
after 2020. so that's the reason why I

197
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,720
went with that chip

198
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,340
but I wanted to I don't want to replace

199
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,539
the keyboard that means I need to

200
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,100
interface with that exact same pin

201
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,319
layout right and we I told you it had I

202
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,720
think I told you I had 11 pins

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
um I need to place my same kind of pin

204
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,100
headers there and I need to but I need

205
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,660
to know how that works right there's 28

206
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,120
keys on the keyboard but there's only 11

207
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
pins

208
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
and so a common thing and when I say

209
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,639
comments like I don't expect you to know

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
this you can Google this when you've got

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
like a toy you're taking apart right

212
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
like a keypad or number pads they

213
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,340
typically do what's multiplexing where

214
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,720
you can see in the bottom right here

215
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,620
there's one pin for for each row and one

216
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,900
pin per each column and you take turns

217
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,300
powering each row and then looking at

218
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,979
each column and if any one of those

219
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,560
columns is is like you make a row high

220
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,180
and if one of those columns is high then

221
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,680
that means that corresponding button has

222
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,419
been pressed and that's how they do this

223
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,520
to cut down on having instead of like 28

224
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,020
different wires you have to wire right

225
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,300
you can do it by you can just do number

226
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,099
of roles plus number of columns and

227
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,020
that's how it works so this has four

228
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,979
rows and seven columns that makes 11.

229
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,479
um I looked at the board looking at the

230
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,940
board you can see these four capacitors

231
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,979
these tiny little C somethings at the

232
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,139
top tight on four of those that made it

233
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,000
really easy to let me know hey these are

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,699
probably the four rows and the other

235
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,099
seven are the seven columns and then you

236
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,139
could use a Multimeter to test that I

237
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,280
never did because I was pretty confident

238
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,720
that's what it was right and it would

239
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,580
take like three hands one hold each lead

240
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,960
of the multimeter and one press the

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,419
button but um you can do a multimeter to

242
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,160
test your assumptions when you're

243
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,660
designing it so that's the keyboard

244
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,400
interface

245
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
uh let's talk about the other things I

246
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,120
see on the circuit the we in the top

247
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,099
I'll start at the top right we got an uh

248
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,379
RGB LED it's got four leads that's

249
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,300
pretty simple one for each of the three

250
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,340
colors and then one a common one for

251
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,379
either ground or power we talked about

252
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,539
the keyboard already

253
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,360
um the in the there's the power switch

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
that's on the back side you can flip it

255
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,200
over and marry up those headers right

256
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,719
and then there's a switch at the bottom

257
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,539
which lets you like select different

258
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,799
difficulty levels of the alphabet I'm

259
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,180
not sure what it did

260
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,560
um but I'm going to have it select

261
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,779
different letters there are different

262
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,180
values for each letter that's optional

263
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,519
and then everything else is is almost

264
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,320
there I'll talk about the LED relays in

265
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,360
a second but you can see all the traces

266
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,220
and follow them at least back back to

267
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,899
the Black Bob so I could see everything

268
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,399
that this circuit was doing it was

269
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,779
really nice that I didn't have to like

270
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,360
follow traces from one side via through

271
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,459
a via to the other side it's all on the

272
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,980
one side because it's on one side when

273
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,019
there are traces need to cross over each

274
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,399
other like usually when you're making a

275
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,380
PCB when traces need to cross over each

276
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,640
other you have one go to the back side

277
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,779
and you're like kind of like sewing

278
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,560
right

279
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,240
but since they only have traces on one

280
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
side they had places where they had had

281
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,600
to cross over

282
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,940
um I still these yellow lined Bridges

283
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,459
those resistors are all marked zero zero

284
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,440
zero which means it's not a resistor

285
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,820
it's just a wire so everywhere one of

286
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,740
those resistors are they're using that

287
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,320
resistor to hop over a trace line

288
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,620
and the technique I don't see very often

289
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,060
but it was it was kind of funny so I

290
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,620
thought to point it out and then the LED

291
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,600
relays the relays are just there so that

292
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
the led doesn't draw too much power

293
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,380
that's not necessarily needed with a

294
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,480
circuit python I mean if you've played

295
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,700
with an Arduino I think you're like okay

296
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
I could pretty much handle each one of

297
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
these things by themselves I can turn on

298
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,700
an LED I can understand like powering a

299
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,440
row and checking the button back for the

300
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
for this keypad eye pin you know check a

301
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,740
switch status and I can probably speak

302
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,480
to a speed I could send audio output to

303
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,500
a speaker

304
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,100
um

305
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,019
so I was like cool I can handle most of

306
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,300
these these things myself

307
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,240
um my first attempt I failed and the

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,760
reason being is that board didn't have

309
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,339
any kind of audio amplifier and I didn't

310
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,779
think about that when I made my audio

311
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,060
when mine so I made mine and the audio

312
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,220
was like extremely quiet because there

313
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,080
was no audio amplifier whatever chip

314
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,760
they're using under there must have a

315
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,380
built-in audio amplifier and I just

316
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,500
wasn't aware so I on my first board I

317
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,120
have the board and then I have like an

318
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,860
audio amplifier like a little you know

319
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,360
Arduino module

320
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
on the side and then I made a second

321
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,300
attempt

322
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,579
um but uh should it's one of those

323
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,899
things that I should have known and I

324
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,000
just felt but

325
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,560
the other thing I wanted to add is I

326
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,360
wanted to add a USB port so that I could

327
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,880
not just like build it once and then put

328
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,019
it together and not change them so I

329
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,459
wanted to add a USB so I could change

330
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,440
the files on the fly now the cool thing

331
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,540
about a Raspberry Pi Pico which by the

332
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,160
way is the same processor that your

333
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,579
Defcon bat or your syncon badge is using

334
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,760
um it supports if you circuit Python and

335
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,260
that circuit python like when you plug

336
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,180
into a USB it'll show up as a drive

337
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,339
Mike's done a lot to make that knot

338
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,600
there because he's hiding things and

339
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,339
he's not even using Circle python but

340
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,500
you can reflash the the badge with

341
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,360
circuit flight Python and then it will

342
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,279
show up as like a mouse storage device

343
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,140
and you can just upload files to it you

344
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,700
can upload the python file to it and

345
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,959
it'll just run your python file so

346
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,579
circuit python is really quite easy I

347
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,500
think that's my next slide yeah circuit

348
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,880
python is really quite easy if you know

349
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,740
python you can just write some python

350
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,180
code you save it and it starts running

351
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,860
your python code I can just drag and

352
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,140
drop wave files to a directory and play

353
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,519
those wav files from a directory

354
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,100
whenever a button is pressed uh it's

355
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,420
instant feedback I don't got to compile

356
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,040
it and then like you know put it on the

357
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,820
thing

358
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,459
and so really really friendly I highly

359
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,980
recommend there's like four dollar

360
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,140
a Raspberry Pi Pico development chips

361
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,760
you can buy from Amazon

362
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,959
um if you're just slightly curious four

363
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
dollars is not a much to just buy one

364
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,620
and try playing with it try running

365
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,839
circuit python on it uh Adafruit has

366
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,740
some great

367
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,200
um documentation or great tutorials on

368
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
how to play with that chip and um it

369
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,579
could for one dollar it's really quite

370
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,540
cool

371
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,060
okay so now all the pieces so let's

372
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,680
design the PCB like again I'm not going

373
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,899
to talk much about this but on the left

374
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,540
side is my schematic layout the big box

375
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,459
is this Raspberry Pi that's really tiny

376
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,720
font

377
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,000
um and then to it it needs a clock and

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
then there's the the programming headers

379
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
not even need it but I put it there just

380
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,740
in case

381
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,839
um but I never actually used it and then

382
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,339
I've got leads to you can see the

383
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,240
speaker and the amp and the USB and

384
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,800
um the switches

385
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
and then

386
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,459
um on the left on the right is the as I

387
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,019
laid it all out I had to make sure that

388
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,000
my pins for the keyboard and the screw

389
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,260
holes were right but then other than

390
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,820
that I could place everything else where

391
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,680
I wanted to

392
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
so here's the comparison of the original

393
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,420
board and then here's my board with the

394
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
modifications to the side you know the

395
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,200
little spot for the USB sticking out on

396
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,220
the bottom

397
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,079
um I think I saw that back here I had to

398
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,180
modify my original toy to make that

399
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,220
little output to fit that

400
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,380
and then even so

401
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,200
also the cutout for the

402
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,959
uh plastic that was there I got my

403
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,339
Dimensions wrong and so I had to take a

404
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,839
Dremel and kind of make that hole a

405
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,000
little bigger wasn't quite pretty

406
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,540
um

407
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,240
but uh it worked

408
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,620
um so it's pretty simple I just have a

409
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,720
microphone I record what I want to say I

410
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,220
let my kids record what they want to say

411
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,800
and then just upload that to the my

412
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
storage device and it works

413
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
and that's my kiddo deciding that he

414
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,899
liked it to be honest he had more fun

415
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,820
putting his own audio on there and then

416
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,260
just listened to himself like he loves

417
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,339
just pressing the same button listening

418
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,500
to himself talk uh he got that from me

419
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,220
uh but yeah he he had a lot of fun with

420
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,940
it

421
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,920
um but the real point with this talk was

422
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,980
that uh we have that toy and plenty

423
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,560
plenty other toys and other real devices

424
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,959
at the hardware hacking Village down in

425
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,160
in the um

426
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't know the area the fun area

427
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,220
um so I would love for you if to come

428
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,320
down and record a letter sound I have

429
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,180
the audio down there but more so there's

430
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,560
a lot of different toys down there and I

431
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,820
can show you how to make attacks where

432
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,200
you don't have to replace the circuit

433
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,980
board

434
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,480
um we can pull the firmware off a little

435
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,600
different toys we can talk to a uart

436
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,680
port if you've never done that before

437
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,440
and we have jtec pings on some things so

438
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,760
really if you're if you're curious about

439
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,260
this kind of thing or you have questions

440
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,899
or you have your own device that you

441
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,639
would like to attack the goal with the

442
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,200
hardware hacking Village was like bring

443
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,339
it there and we'll figure it out

444
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,180
together

445
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,320
um if you're curious you have something

446
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,699
you've started or you just want to play

447
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,680
with it please come down and visit us

448
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
um that but they're really that was kind

449
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,220
of the point of this talk so I really

450
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,720
appreciate you guys uh taking a few

451
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
minutes to be here I know it said to be

452
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,779
30 minutes and I rambled really really

453
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,339
fast

454
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,600
um but yeah do you guys have any

455
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,060
questions for me right here I kind of

456
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,959
went pretty quickly

457
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,320
yeah so yes what program did I use to

458
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,620
design the circuit board and what else

459
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,480
how did I Fab the circuit board so I use

460
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,000
kycat kai-cad is free open source tool

461
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,220
for Designing Electronics

462
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,899
um it's a beautiful tool I used to use

463
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,699
eel which is a commercial product but

464
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,820
kai-cat is much better and it's free

465
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,639
um and so kai-cad has come up overhead

466
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,740
Skype CAD can even give you a 3D model

467
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,480
of your tool like like after you've

468
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
designed it

469
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
um and once you design it there

470
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,079
I sent it to I'm I'm not really like I

471
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,720
sent it to all PCB in China to get it

472
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,459
fabbed that's mainly because they were

473
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,300
cheap

474
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,880
um there's a us one OSH Park which

475
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,620
charges you by the square inch so if

476
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,360
you're doing something small like a mini

477
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,220
badge OS Park's pretty cheap you're

478
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,199
doing something big OS Park gets way out

479
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,519
of price

480
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,699
um The Fab for this it's like I get five

481
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,639
boards for it was like 13 and then

482
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,160
shipping's on top of that so DHL is

483
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,320
gonna be 20 bucks and the you know post

484
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
rate shipping's like five bucks so

485
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,040
depends on how much how big of a hurry

486
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,880
you are

487
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,680
um most most the Chinese shops are

488
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,019
cheaper but they take forever

489
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,139
um yeah that answer your question yeah I

490
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,600
really I really would encourage I think

491
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
hobby is teaching a course on many

492
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,899
badges here somewhere if he's not I'm

493
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,399
gonna go yell at him but he should be

494
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,620
because that course really teaches intro

495
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,720
to like designing a board and like

496
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,860
you've already got a good footprint

497
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,420
right like it takes care of a lot of the

498
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,920
hurdles for you and then once you've

499
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,139
designed one your your world opens up

500
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,519
it's like oh I could do anything right

501
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,440
it's pretty cool so take his course if

502
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,300
you've never done one before

503
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,060
any questions any others

504
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,339
great thank you guys for coming I hope

505
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,600
it was at least something that you were

506
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,920
kind of interested in um maybe it didn't

507
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,420
go the way you thought but uh thank you

508
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,820
