33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,780
server room that doesn't allow computers

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,979

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,560
going to be epic like and I'm like when

42

I mean epic I mean epically fail or I

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
don't know which It's like because I've

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,340
never done this one here and that's like

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,500
uh we're gonna fit and do it live so

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,619
bear with me uh but this is my legal

47
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,259
disclaimer uh I'm not a lawyer but I

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,219
played one on the internet before

49
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,200
successfully

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,818
um and so when I talk about the bad

51
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,739
things you see me doing something bad or

52
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,120
you see me doing bad stuff you're going

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,020
to be like

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,020

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,680
still from you or kill you unless you

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,239

that too

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,099
because trust me people always think

64
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,660
that I'm I'm joking about that and then

65
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,640

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,180
um that that's the most exciting part of

101
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,560
the whole effing bio to be honest with

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,780
you it's like it's like Minecraft in

103
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,000
space for old nerds uh I love building

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,620
bases there

105
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,599
um okay that fun part's over let me tell

106
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,120
you about how much this industry sucks

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,739
um so

108
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,280
I am so tired of hearing stupid user

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,918
clicked on a link stupid user went to a

110
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,079
website stupid information security

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
didn't properly train their users and

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,580
trying to ship the blame all onto them

113
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,699
humans are not the weakest link they're

114
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,800
the least invested in

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
it's like if you were running it's like

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,500
in investing in your technology and your

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,600
defenses and you as you invested in

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,740
people

119
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,919
you'd have a Cisco picks from 97 put

120
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,840
into your thing with an ACL that's allow

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,300
all but no logging

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,919
and think you're secure with the snort

123
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,400
IDs with the default signatures on

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
that's exactly what you would have

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,580
the problem is we need to invest in

126
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,759
actually teaching our users that they

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,000
are responsible for a piece of equipment

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
when you give a delivery driver a van

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,960
you don't tell them the keys good luck

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
you know what to do

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
no that sixty thousand dollars piece of

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
equipment you make sure they're trained

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,280
on you make sure they understand the

134
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,259
rules they understand the defense tech

135
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,400
oh my God I don't want to see everybody

136
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,780
because then they'll see them judging me

137
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,240
it's like uh it's like I mean some of

138
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
you are quite handsome and pretty but

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
it's like you know but still no they're

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,460
okay uh so you don't you don't want to

141
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,960
get you know you don't see that whole

142
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,880
distraction it's like and this is why

143
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,860
we're running late thank you oh not that

144
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
dark it's like then I'm like a shadowy

145
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,639
shroud it's like too close to Halloween

146
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,840
for that my gosh okay

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,400
um but yeah you give them this equipment

148
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,199
and you tell them it's like hey you know

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,300
here's your your blinkers your defenses

150
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,860
okay we'll deal with that because I

151
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,940
don't want to keep it light changing

152
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,620
it's like and you know you don't want

153
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,060
them to like you'd let them know what

154
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,979
they're expected of them we give a

155
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,539
person a laptop

156
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,639
I'm like oh yeah you know the rules does

157
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,620
the policies have fun

158
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,800
if a person wrecks a van you're out

159
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
sixty thousand dollars

160
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,900
that person is probably getting fired

161
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,539
how many people click on links that have

162
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,240
cost companies over 350 million dollars

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Target but yeah

164
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,820
it's like and we don't even bat an eye

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,380
they're jeopardizing and could

166
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,740
potentially cost accompany millions of

167
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,759
dollars

168
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,479
and we're just like yeah it happens

169
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,340
we need to get better at showing our

170
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,259
people what the real threats are

171
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,240
because we're getting all the ccos and

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,020
cios care about the apts oh my gosh

173
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,960
we need spooky music you know advanced

174
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
persistent

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,360
threats

176
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,940
right gives me chills

177
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,800
well I don't know how to do you know

178
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,880
what you know what apt really stands for

179
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,800
because let's face it the only thing we

180
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
use apt for is your CEO to tell the

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,580
public and the shareholders that you got

182
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
piped by an email right it's like

183
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,880
because apt actually stands for adequate

184
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,520
fishing technique

185
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,840
that is apt

186
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,479
and he's like but I want you to know I

187
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,819
don't do apt it's like I'm a high school

188
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,440

is like and I love showing people what

208
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,419
real threats are like so they get

209
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,699
understanding it's not that advanced

210
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,400
it's not that all this leak coding skill

211
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,740
and all these tools it's like no it's

212
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,800
like it's this is how easy it is I use

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,500
one of the this first of all mostly

214
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
every attack that I do involves the most

215
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,500
dangerous hacking tool ever invented by

216
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,440
man it's like still in use today is

217
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,179
don't please don't say Cali it's like

218
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,479
it's still the best most leadest hacking

219
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,919
tool

220
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll start with Google

221
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,480
um something you don't really know about

222
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,459
me it's like I'm a nice guy I try to be

223
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,899
a nice guy or at least play one on the

224
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,540
internet sometimes I'm very Petty

225
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,120
Ian why you know back in the day because

226
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,620
I didn't have a high school diploma and

227
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,420
I passed all their other they wouldn't

228
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,620
hire me

229
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,839
I'm not saying I hold a grudge but let's

230
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,279
go hacking why and see if we can break

231
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,700
into their building okay why not

232
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,200
anybody for me and white don't raise

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
your hand because also I don't care I'm

after Ian why

236
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,459
it's like I want to physically because

237
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,800
this is about physical compromise so how

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,839
are we going to rob them well let's find

239
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,820

had to go to the New York office so uh

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,279
once for eny for a class that I ended up

242
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,959
finding a vulnerability in their MySQL

243
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,279
server that was facing the internet that

244

248
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,580

249
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,339
now and they've got their name on the

250
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,000

Tony Stark wannabes it's like you know

255
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,040

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,380
they own that building but do they

257
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,240
manage that building you think Tony

258
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,040
Stark is out there you know collecting

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
the rent off the Starbucks making sure

260
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,060
he's hiring the janitorial staff and the

261
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,980
security for that building no because

262
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,899
he's passed him a moment of silence for

263
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,860
him

264
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,040
#too soon it's like miss you Tony it's

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
like so yeah no he doesn't do that

266
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,420

287
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,300

eating

292
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,500

Chinatown for that noodles even if it's

294

on the subway

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,820
it's like no they're going to be like

296
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,380
within five minutes of the building

297
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,360
because they're good employees they're

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,820
go-getters you know it's like so it's

299
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,959
like they're going to be like you know

300
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
right nearby say at those restaurants

301
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
right there where you can put up a prox

302
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,180
card reader you can like you know

303
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,980
actually do some pictures figure out

304
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,360
what their badges look like you know

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,160
what the traffic looks like you know

306
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
send some coupons for some discounts

307
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,820
because everybody likes to you know a

308
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,380
little bit of money off on something in

309
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,620
a PDF you you do that it's like oh

310

311
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,200
employees your Executives oh that's

312
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,940
where they're going to be staying good

313
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,959
to know

314
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,640
can't do anything with that kind of

315
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,019
information

316
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,240
not at all it's like and then your

317
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,500
neighboring officers I don't care about

318
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,600
them it's like I've used a a neighbor's

319
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,760
uh uh that was nearby in the same

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,440
building to set an appointment with them

321
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,380
so I could then just take the elevator

322
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,300
down and not get it squirted down of

323
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,140
course because they don't they just

324
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,579
leave you at the elevator and just go

325
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,079
one floor down and then Rob the place

326
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,579
that was fun

327
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,699
um

328
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
the blueprints

329
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,579
seriously

330
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,519
I mean if you if anybody's ever here has

331
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,200
worked at a bank they're getting PTSD

332
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
flashbacks It's like because that is

333
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,740
terrifying to actually have the

334
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,120
blueprints

335
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,579
and I mean and they give it to you

336
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,260
I mean I love this this is all the

337
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,720
public areas you know the main lobby and

338
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,300
The Concourse uh below the building I

339
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,920
love how they highlight it because like

340
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,980
please pay attention to this area and

341
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,019
I'm like no

342
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,300
you got like security looking all mean

343
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,160
and intimidating and like you know

344
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
they're asking really mean questions

345
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,000
like you know what are you doing here

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,620
why do you have that computer I don't

347
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,500
want to answer those Quantic questions

348
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,440
so I'm looking for the gray area that's

349
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,480
the good stuff right that's the stuff

350
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
like nothing to see here nothing behind

351
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,680
the curtain right because actually where

352
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,360
the loading dock is

353
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,880
that's where the freight elevator is

354
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
if you're using the I mean come on okay

355
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,740
I understand the freight elevator it

356
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,420
does smell every once in a while okay

357
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,760
and there could be a guy named Ernie and

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,899
stuff there and there which still gives

359
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,899
me flashbacks but that's fine

360
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,940
It's like because that is the least

361
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,100
protected area to get into the upper

362
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,120
floors

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
but I don't know where the upper floors

364
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,600
go I don't know what their layouts are

365
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,779
and when you're trying to rob someone

366
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,000
you want to have the familiarity you

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
want to be walking someone questioning

368
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,579
like what are you doing here what's

369
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,380
going on oh I'm going to the electrical

370
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,519
closet right down there to the right

371
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,040
next to the main conference room oh that

372
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,980
sounds legit never been there before but

373
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,260
I don't have to be because I got all the

374
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,120
floor blueprints as well telling me

375
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,920
where the electrical box is right next

376
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,680
to the main conference room

377
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
so that helps

378
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,339
and once again

379
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,459
that dark shaded area

380
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,139
do not look here

381
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,060
this is not the access level you're

382
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
looking for

383
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,779
you know this is not the doorways that

384
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,540
you need it's like well my Jedi Mind

385
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,040
Tricks don't work on me

386
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,800
takes intelligence I'm do but also it

387
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
takes a wonderful building management

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
company that included in their brochures

389
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
the ungraded out areas

390
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,500
so they exactly tell you exactly where

391
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,700
everything's at

392
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,160
it made you work for a little bit and

393
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,440
one of the things I love is this whole

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,639
first of all you have basements in Utah

395
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,519
I'm so evangelia that

396
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,980
you know I love all these idiots trying

397
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,139
to like shame people like from hacker in

398
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,000
their basement but I would kill for a

399
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,260
basement

400
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,240
I would love to have a lab in a basement

401
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,579
I would totally be there

402
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,440
and I would call it my Lair Without

403
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,100
Shame

404
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,160
okay

405
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,100
[Applause]

406
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,620
I didn't use some super computer with a

407
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,940
whole bunch of screens with like you

408
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,380
know two people typing on the keyboard

409
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,480
to make myself lead

410
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,959
no I had pizza and Diet Pepsi the Panera

411
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,380
Bread when I was hacking these wools

412
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,300
company wonderful people eating why

413
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,579
great great great auditing work uh

414
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,019
they're gonna audit me I'm I can tell

415
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,540
now it's like but yes that's what I did

416
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,399
and the reason why I did it there is

417
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,079
because I'm also doing it in your

418
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,579
company's Lobby

419
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,920
at your company's Starbucks or little

420
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
cafe

421
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,220
so I can do that

422
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,019
on that small little handheld device

423
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,360
that doesn't look like a computer

424
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,160
and that's only got 16 gigs of RAM

425
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,720
running Windows 11 and stuff you know

426
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,420
with an i7 processor it's like with a

427
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,000
one terabyte hard drive it's like I

428
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,620
barely got anything done that's why I

429
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,060
love this thing because it's actually

430
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,180
got 32 gigs of RAM two terabytes of hard

431
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,980
drive space running an AMD ryzen

432
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,800
processor with a 6800 GPU

433
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,300
much nicer it's like um and and also it

434
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,740
oh my gosh the graphics when you're

435
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,300
playing no man's sky and soul color but

436
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,680
don't tell my CEO because he's the one

437
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,060
that bought it because I'd use it for

438
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,980
contesting only

439
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,260
it's like uh

440
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,699
we'll go with that

441
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,100
say nothing Alex okay good

442
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,320
um I forgot the co-worker was here oops

443
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,980
my bad it's like uh so yeah so I use

444
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,000
that

445
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,860
and I'm watching the traffic patterns

446
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
I'm watching to see what your security

447
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,459
looks like what they're what everybody's

448
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,560
dressed like what the badges look like

449
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,660
maybe doing some Wi-Fi stuff you know

450
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,579
because I like to act like I'm lead it's

451
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,500
like oh all that stuff but I'm also

452
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,399
using other memes I don't just Google

453
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,100
I'm not one trick pony

454
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,180
I'm also on Instagram

455
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,720
you want to know why people drink

456
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,699
#new badge search on Instagram that's

457
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,519
why we drink okay maybe not here but

458
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,980
it's like a lot of people drink because

459
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,220
of that and it's like and I love this

460
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,660
Ernst young was so nice to actually

461
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,660
include a location tag for the insta you

462
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,439
know because you gotta do it for the

463
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,079
gram right I can I don't have to be

464
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,819
inside the building

465
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,339
because I'm literally seeing pictures of

466
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,280
inside buildings that I'm about to Rob

467
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,439
and seeing where their stuff is set up

468
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,959
seeing where they're they're uh where

469
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,579
the go to their architect's website

470
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,439
because they're very proud of the the

471
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,120
work they did inside the interior of

472
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,280
these Office Buildings and you can

473
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,900
literally see

474
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,240
where the conference room is how the

475
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,860
reception is where the break rooms are

476
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
because you always want to go to the

477
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,200
break room first

478
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,660
seriously it's like you got to hit the

479
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,000
break room first uh and so and then you

480
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,940
also see other pictures like who needs

481
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,740
to do fingerprinting it's like like an

482
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,240
OS or what operating system are they

483
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,039
using what technology they have oh I've

484
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
got insta for that they're using Windows

485
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
Dell machines it's like a Lenovo think

486
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,100
pads they've got iPhones for their

487
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,900
mobile devices for their their email

488
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,160
carriers and stuff you know probably

489
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,740
like some kind of iPhone app or iOS mail

490
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,660
carrier it's like yeah I've got all that

491
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,500
down

492
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,419
no worries

493
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,760
it's like and trust me if that doesn't

494
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,799
work don't worry that's what linkedin's

495
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,600
jobs postings are for

496
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,059
you do a search for the job posting what

497
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,200
the company's hired they're telling you

498
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,220
what they're looking for what

499
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,840
architecture that you need to have what

500
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,120
coding you need to know what technology

501
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
that you need to use and if that doesn't

502
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,380
work you just go to the people that are

503
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,539
currently working there and you see what

504
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,940
their skill sets are

505
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,559
because you're not going to get a person

506
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,860
who is well versed in checkpoint and

507
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,780
Fortinet and stuff you know in those two

508
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,380
technologies and you know and McAfee and

509
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,640
think like oh I wonder if they're

510
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,780
wondering Kaspersky with Cisco picks no

511
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,760
if like you're you're basically telling

512
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,400
you what what they're running

513
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
but I mentioned the badges right love

514
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
the badges

515
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
that that that that one in the upper

516
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,260
corner upper right hand corner is even

517
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,360
better you know why

518
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
because it shows the key

519
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
who here has 3D printed TSA Keys Lord

520
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,460
knows I do

521
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,220
thank you TSA Homeland Security

522
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,679
we treat your physical security of your

523
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,600
luggage like we want to treat the

524
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,460
encryption of your emails but you know

525
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,960
don't think about that too much it's

526
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,960
like so yeah it's like um you got to you

527
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
could make a whole 3D print I don't know

528
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,140
how to do lock picking you got deviant

529
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,640
for people that actually know people

530
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,500
that actually do that kind of stuff I

531
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,299
literally cannot lock pick to save my

532
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,240
life I use cardboard or a crowbar but

533
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,799
most times I just ask someone to let me

534
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,940
in and they usually do it and that's

535
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,620
works for me

536
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
but I love badges

537
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,840
I love badges

538
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,780
and you know what it's like I love other

539
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,720
people's badges because they show me

540
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,880
what to print

541
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,720
because I've got the badgie 100.

542
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
the only way this could be cooler

543
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,700
is if it was named the badge 3000

544
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,740
seriously from getting a picture off of

545
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,440
Instagram in Boston from getting it

546
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,460
printed

547
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,559
it's like I'm a friend's uh you know

548
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,940
badge printer

549
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,179
15 minutes and yes I use that exact

550
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,320
badge

551
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,940
and they're like yeah but Jason doesn't

552
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,460
have RFID it doesn't have you know it's

553
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,500
like you didn't uh prox bar clone or

554
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,660
anything like that and it's like yeah

555
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,940
I love it when I don't do that

556
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,740
because then I go up to the badge reader

557
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
I got a meeting in five minutes

558
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,559
can we make something happen

559
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,399
you know

560
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,679
hello soup important white person look

561
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,059
at me plug in

562
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,380
hey if you don't have white the only the

563
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,460
only reason why you should be using

564
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,720
white privilege is to be telling people

565
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,220
how bad and horrible it is right

566
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,100
seriously so I'm like yeah it's like you

567
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,620
know use that

568
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,320
so another thing and I get this a lot

569
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,760
from people

570
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,620
it's like especially my detractors you

571
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,900
know there's plenty it's like you're not

572
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,340
that technical Jason

573
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
you're not that you you've not done any

574
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,820
like skills you're like you didn't even

575
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
really red teaming stuff you like to act

576
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,720
like I'm like yeah

577
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,720
exactly I'm not that technical I don't

578
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,340
know how to code I've never heard out of

579
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,440
code it's like literally I would say

580
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,419
that if you look into the dictionary and

581
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,100
if you look at imposter syndrome in the

582
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,480
dictionary you'd see my picture but I

583
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,620
don't think I'm good enough to actually

584
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,260
be in the dictionary under that okay

585
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,760
it's like

586
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,799
so yeah so no I'm not talking about but

587
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,380
let's ask a question it's like

588
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,320
do you think your company's as secure as

589
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
a bank who's trying to guard money

590
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,760
especially from some loser like me

591
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,020
that's just going to walk in off the

592
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,520
street

593
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,260
well let's do this little friendly thing

594
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,260
let's actually look at a video

595
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,760
of me robbing a bank and Beirut Lebanon

596
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,039
unedited exactly the way it's going to

597
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,020
work and it's like this is none of the

598
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,820
video it's eight minutes and we're gonna

599
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,880
see how long it takes for me from

600
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,340
walking into the front door

601
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,020
to compromising my first machine

602
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,840
here we go

603
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,240
walk in and I love right off the bat

604
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,919
look at that lady

605
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,220
she she did such everything so bright so

606
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,500
wonderful she knew I was sketchy AF as

607
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,600
soon as she saw me

608
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,840
she knew I was up to no good

609
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,320
oh look wait hold on oh 15 seconds

610
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,520
between walking the front door and

611
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,900
compromising the first machine if that

612
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,419
was what your answer was you won

613
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,059
uh that's 19 seconds 20 seconds it's

614
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,400
actually executing the code

615
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,000
running the payload in around 22 seconds

616
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,340
saving it finishing in 25 I have

617
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,900
completely compromised one machine in

618
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,700
another 30 seconds

619
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,679
that took a lot of technical know-how to

620
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,580
do

621
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,200
and I love the fact that she stops me

622
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,240
wait hold on I forgot hold on there's a

623
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,820
I'm not professional by Nature it's like

624
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,860
uh

625
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,260
there we go

626
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,460
can you hear the sound

627
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,740
there you go I'm here to do the USB

628
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,900
she's doing wonderful she's asking me

629
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,820
questions she's challenging me but I'm

630
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,039
in an assertive role I'm doing a USB

631
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,840
audit I don't know what a USB audit is

632
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,900
but I do a lot of them

633
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,380
[Music]

634
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,940
and they're very successful no problem

635
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,520
but she challenged me I was literally

636
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,559
taking the offensive you need to call

637
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,059
headquarters didn't headquarters are you

638
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,100
I wasn't cowering or acting like I was

639
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,460
caught or The Jig was up but look what

640
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,020
she does she takes me to the manager

641
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,340
with exactly what she could do but then

642
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,980
she made the one mistake

643
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,559
I let her go I said I'll stand by

644
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,320
because she thought I was

645
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,240
honestly okay so then I switched to a

646
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,640
passive row as a Helper and I

647
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,280
compromised the bank uh Bank manager's

648
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,399
machine

649
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,159
because I went from assertive and now

650
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm in the Pastoral and I'm trying to

651
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,539
make make the network faster

652
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,419
you can be on a T3 line through fiber to

653
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,980
your desktop you ask someone the network

654
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,500
running slow yeah I think so well I'm

655
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,240
here to make it faster mother what do

656
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,799
you need and do you have a network

657
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,840
server here too as well I was like hey

658
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,940
let's go for the Gusto right let's break

659
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,740
into the data center

660
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,539
I mean I'm here anyway right

661
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,960
that's my trusted agent because I'm

662
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,159
doing a security awareness engagement

663
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,080
I'm not doing red team so and I'm

664
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,580
telling him to step back because he's

665
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,080
way too close because he can't believe

666
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,880
what's going on either I'm like you and

667
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,700
me both bud it's like you and me both

668
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,400
so and this is unedited because I want

669
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,020
you to think that I try to cut and paste

670
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,520
it and make it look cooler so sorry for

671
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,000
the buck cam

672
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,520
this is a hidden uh camera and a button

673
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,320
uh from the National Geographic show

674
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,700
that wasn't used at Darren kitchen

675
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,679
acquired somehow I ain't asking

676
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,400
questions and so I'm showing you

677
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,799
and here he goes he does the you know he

678
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,480
does the the code which is super secret

679
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,220
that I could never have shoulder surfed

680
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,140
and told you what it was I think it was

681
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,240
his kid's birthday and he opens up the

682
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,440
now I thought here let will you let me

683
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,360
stay here unattended okay thank you

684
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,140
hold on listen

685
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,360
that was a side defeat I want them to do

686
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,320
good

687
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm an advocate not an adversary I'm

688
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,159
trying to root for the guy but but then

689
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,440
I remembered something wait that mother

690
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,120
here's my golden ticket

691
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
I don't want to be too far from him that

692
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,539
lady May question him because she was

693
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,460
doing a lot of good stuff so she may

694
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,659
question him it's like I got to catch up

695
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,640
with them it's like no don't leave my

696
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,620
side Bud we still got to go to do the

697
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,039
teller line

698
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,520
I would run over and talk to you guys

699
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,020
over there but it's like I would fall

700
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,000
down and it would be funny but it would

701
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,700
not be constructive so I'm thinking

702
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,520
about you right here it's like so now

703
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,980
I'm behind the teller line

704
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,440
yeah

705
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,940
yep that's not good for somebody

706
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,260
ain't me it's perfect I'm having a great

707
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,880
day right now

708
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,100
it was good

709
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,600
but this part was so rude

710
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,279
and they're usually very hospitable

711
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
kind of employee locks their workstation

712
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,940
how am I how am I supposed to Rob them

713
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,600
but that's okay the manager went and got

714
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,700
the employee so he could come over and

715
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,440
and unlock the workstation for me

716
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,340
oh that was close I'm trying to go for

717
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,080
100 here people

718
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm sorry I'm literally French so I

719
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,279
always tell people I always try like you

720
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,080

721

728
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,679
to go to the Vault it's not that big

729
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,240
shiny metal thing they like to make it

730
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,580
look like in the movies now we're in the

731
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,440
vault with the most powerful person in

732
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,240
the bank let's just plug this in real

733
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,880
quick you know why

734
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,100
yeah that's the one doing the wire

735
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,080
transfers so in the way

736
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
that's where the money is that's where

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,220
the money's being transferred

738
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,440
oh and she was in the middle of a wire

739
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,620
transfer when I interrupted her

740
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,960
my bad oops

741
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,580
because there it goes executing right

742
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,559
there and I'm like oh nice maybe I

743
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,460
shouldn't have plugged it in right then

744
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,260
but too late now

745
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,299
LOL okay

746
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,320
there we go payload's done okay

747
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,539
and I'm like

748
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,400
well this was unexpected I really

749
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,720
appreciate your help

750
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,179
I'll take it unexpected thank you

751
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,340
and as we're walking out I remembered

752
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,260
one important thing good I think I've

753
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,539
got everybody I'm Petty AF I'm the data

754
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,940
center so oh I didn't get her machine

755
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,679
real quick I forgot to get the one

756
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,760
person who stopped me

757
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,559
on these engagements I'm being paid to

758
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,360
be a horrible person remember the

759
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,779
kittens

760
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,400
so of course I have to compromise her

761
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,080
machine but this time with the manager

762
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,980
behind me okay making sure she does it

763
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,320
the only person I have felt bad in

764
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,419
engagement in a very long time was her

765
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,640
because she was a model employee she did

766
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,860
everything the correct way I'm done

767
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,600
except for she didn't talk to the

768
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,440
manager and explained hey there's weird

769
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
you know American dude you know wanting

770
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,380
to talk to you and I'm not I don't know

771
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,320
what he's doing because she thought he

772
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,779
was going to vet me thank you he thought

773
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,020
she vetted me and no one vetted me

774
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,240
and this sums it up pretty well right

775
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,320
here

776
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,020
that just happen I don't

777
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,419
I don't know

778
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,340
I was more surprised than anybody else

779
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,580
but I mean I will have to admit

780
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,620
there was no Python tutorial so luckily

781
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,200
I was able to avoid capture you know and

782
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,600
I didn't have to use Ruby or you know my

783
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,240
metasployal metasploitable shells and

784
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,380
never I didn't have to use any of that

785
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,240
stuff you know thank goodness or I would

786
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,580
have been in trouble uh it wasn't needed

787
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,740
I will show you this one tool that I

788
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,539
found that I used it's like on this next

789
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,640
engagement don't worry this is much

790
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,500
quicker notice I'm coming from the

791
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,360
public area

792
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,880
but I don't walk directly to the teller

793
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,899
line because they're going to be

794
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,520
suspicious because I came straight from

795
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,340
the outside so I hide behind this column

796
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,840
there's a lady on the phone behind me

797
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,919
and I wait there for just a few seconds

798
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,980
and then I walk from the private area

799
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,020
where that lady's desk was like I had to

800
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,640
talk to her and I just walked right

801
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,620
behind the sewer line

802
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,320
I go to the very last machine

803
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,659
make sure they see me go out of my way

804
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,700
to say hello because I'm a polite robber

805
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,260
okay

806
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,960
I've got manners I'm from the south it's

807
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,299
like so there we go I plug into the

808
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,340
first machine that is not plugged in or

809
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,779
turned on

810
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,360
but I'm establishing a pattern

811
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,820
so when I go to the next

812
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,399
machine which is hers

813
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm just like pardon I have to plug this

814
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,380
in

815
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,559
there you go do a USB audit another one

816
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,799
of those

817
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Mercy because you know polite and I

818
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,440
speak French not really

819
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,539
and then this lady was not having it she

820
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,799
was a little busy I already read it in

821
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,299
her body language so I just did what any

822
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,799
good bank robber does I spin in the

823
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,020
chair uh until she's available

824
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,659
and she's like I I'm I'm busy I'm doing

825
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,799
work I'm like oh that's okay I'm just

826
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
doing one quick thing uh robbing you

827
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,539
don't don't mind me it's like uh it

828
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,760
won't take but a moment

829
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,340
there it goes thank you

830
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,659
so nice

831
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,580
and look I'm leaving it's like you know

832
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,100
we all ended up smiling they're smiling

833
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm smiling everybody's smiling it was a

834
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,960
very positive experience for a robbery

835
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,700
and then the lady that was on her phone

836
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,100
I'm now coming from the teller side

837
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,460
which is the private side for her the

838
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,679
non-public side and I was able to take

839
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,179
her machine as well

840
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,700
and the only reason why I was able to

841
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,480
manage that was because of that column

842
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,760
if I would have walked in directly from

843
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,919
the front of the building

844
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,500
people subconsciously

845
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,360
would have not trusted me as much

846
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,240
because they knew in the background see

847
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,120
I clearly I I was not this is not

848
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,220
something that I was taught this is

849
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,260
something I've adapted over my life as

850
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,580
being someone on the Spectrum and having

851
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,860
to deal with like horrible people a lot

852
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,960
in my younger years you have to read

853
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,240
human nature because seriously normal

854
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,360
people frighten the out of me it's like

855
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,039
and so I had to start learning what

856
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,840
human nature was like and what normal

857
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,520
people were supposed to be like and I

858
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,500
was like so I could learn to either

859
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,620
avoid or to mimic and stuff you know so

860
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,240
I could you know mask be like Oh I'm

861
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,039
that guy yeah I'm what you're looking

862
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,200
for it's like you know don't hurt me

863
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,840
we're good right and so and that's what

864
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,520
I've learned on human nature and that's

865
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,880
what I use to attack your companies it's

866
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,720
like I'm using human nature against them

867
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,640
those natural things that you think

868
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,899
about in the back of your head but you

869
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,760
don't really think about them you just

870
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,700
operate with them

871
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,460
so after that the question was you know

872
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,100
you sure hope so but maybe not really

873
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,440
because I'm not attacking your network

874
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,320
technology or zero days to get in

875
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,559
I'm just attacking your people

876
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,659
because we're not empowering them and

877
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,299
educating them enough on what a real

878
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,000
threat's going to look like and just to

879
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,640
basically question someone if they come

880
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,260
and say they want to do something with

881
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,059
their machine

882
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,799
well I don't want to be rude

883
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,919
what it's 2022 seriously

884
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,279
have you been on a plane lately

885
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,399
it's like you don't have to be rude you

886
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,720
don't have to tackle the person I'm

887
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,519
fragile I bruise easily that might be me

888
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,500
don't tackle

889
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,260
but you have to ask questions are you

890
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,140
supposed to be here call security

891
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,840
call information let them know to call

892
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,760
you and say hey there's someone sketchy

893
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,500
AF here I think we need to do something

894
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,960
about it because once again I'm trying

895
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,580
to put them at ease without them

896
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,080
realizing it

897
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,100
this picture was taken one day apart

898
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,159
it's like one the first day I showed him

899
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,980
the goatee ungelled hair your company's

900
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,539
Computer Guy

901
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,879
you know because you know I thought it

902
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,139
was funny and I come with warning labels

903
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,359
it's like in a couple devices sticking

904
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,699
out there the next day I'm in a nice

905
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,980
dress shirt oh this one I don't know

906
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,659
what that means it's like some flashy

907
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,719
cufflinks nice watch gelled hair shaved

908
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,060
because I want them to think that he

909
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,500
looks familiar

910
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,540
can't really place them but I think I've

911
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,980
seen them before

912
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,780
it's put in the back of their head

913
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,659
but also notice the most important

914
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,919
element of those pictures

915
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,580
it's effing snowing outside

916
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,739
I am freezing every you know thing

917
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,178
horribly I am cold

918
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,918
why do I not have a jacket on is it

919
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,418
because I'm an idiot don't answer that

920
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,040
no because once I break into the company

921
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,680
spoiler alert I did it's like once I do

922
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,700
that

923
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,859
if I still had my parka on because

924
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,000
that's what I needed I'm from remember

925
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,940
Texas it's like it's like

926
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,220
wouldn't I be a little suspicious

927
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,140
wouldn't I stand out walking around

928
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,180
inside your hallways with a big winter

929
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,460
jacket on

930
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,220
but if I don't have a jacket on

931
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,640
if I'm wearing short sleeve shirt inside

932
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,339
a company while it's snowing outside

933
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,780
then that means I must have put my

934
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,400
jacket up somewhere

935
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,500
that must have been that I'm here and

936
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,940
I'm like him I put that in the office

937
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,240
and I'm doing a day's work

938
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,420
and that's not something you think about

939
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,720
but now that I said it you go oh

940
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,940
the weirdo's got a point and I'm like

941
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,560
yeah

942
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,079
that's just human nature

943
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,240
so let's go over some of the layers I

944
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,140
use

945
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,839
Layer Two is the assertive role you know

946
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,760
it doesn't mean aggressive I've been

947
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,619
aggressive in certain countries it's

948
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,540
like especially uh in some European

949
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,339
countries being assertive actually helps

950
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,839
it's like what part of surprise

951
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,720
inspected do you not understand

952
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,300
I needed the server room I need it now

953
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,800
and if you don't want to be on the

954
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,900
report that's going to happen don't you

955
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,339
think so

956
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,079
mother been here

957
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,660
it's 3 A.M my time I don't need this

958
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,420
please let you in and I lied I still put

959
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,060
them on the report but it's like so um

960
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,900
but usually the mannerisms are like this

961
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,760
it's like when I used in the bank when I

962
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,820
was being challenged I didn't like go oh

963
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,680
no I don't know what I'm I don't know no

964
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,960
I challenge back didn't you get a

965
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,760
message from uh headquarters I'm

966
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,079
supposed to be here I'm doing the USB

967
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,880
audit I was challenging I was being

968
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,400
assertive I'm doing an audit role it's

969
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,859
like and the hardware I have to use has

970
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,619
to be a little bit more discreet because

971
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,240
the better discrete it is the better

972
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,940
chances you are of getting it and then

973
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,020
it's like

974
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,060
it helps if you're dressing for the role

975
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,920
right

976
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,240
I love this

977
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,280
you know what this is

978
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,520
this is the business suit of Doom

979
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,320
I call it the business through the Doom

980
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,660
because it's hand tailored for my tailor

981
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,599
in Beijing Peter wonderful guy uh can't

982
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,339
go back to China anymore but uh long

983
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,859
story but it's like uh but I I love my

984
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,300
suits

985
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,579
because it makes me look fancy

986
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,640
and also the best part about these suits

987
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,220
is when I was trying to explain to Peter

988
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,560
what I wanted

989
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,380
and when I was telling him he said are

990
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,780
you a magician

991
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,680
and I'm like no Peter I'm not a magician

992
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,079
It's like because a magician you always

993
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,480
hear them they say nothing up my sleeves

994
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,680
and Peter didn't I specifically tell you

995
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,859
to actually put pockets in my sleeve

996
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,160
so I could like carry a bash bunny too

997
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,020
or some other device in the sleep

998
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,320
because was it practical no is it cool

999
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,980
yes

1000
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,940
so yeah Peter I'm not I'm not a magician

1001
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,460
I'm a bank robber it's like or hacker

1002
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,700
you know pin tester so yeah so you gotta

1003
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,619
love those you gotta love my pockets

1004
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,180
right

1005
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,060
and I'm and but also

1006
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,280
he makes me fancy

1007
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,260
and I love being fancy every once in a

1008
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,220
while okay it's like spoiler alert okay

1009
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,660
hoodies are cool and comfortable okay

1010
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,500
but I like being fancy and but when you

1011
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,540
make me wear a time of I'm going to

1012
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,400
wreck you

1013
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,680
okay and that doesn't even cost extra

1014
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,780
you made me wear a tie you're going to

1015
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,780
pay for that it's like but that's okay

1016
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,900
it's like but hey

1017
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,480
I can accessorize still

1018
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,980
do you see the three hacking devices

1019
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,140
there

1020
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,780
well I mean the pin's sort of easy right

1021
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,700
here

1022
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,099
that's sort of easy

1023
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,200
video camera pin I'm a walking talking

1024
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,060
Google streetcar on these engagements

1025
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,000
yeah that that's fine it's like but what

1026
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,460
about oh

1027
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,560
I got a couple of these

1028
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,200
this one I love this 16 gig USB hard

1029
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,700
drive with a high def video camera with

1030
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,500
infrared but you unscrew that plug in

1031
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,780
the cable download 16 gigs of your data

1032
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,920
which probably wouldn't do any harm to

1033
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,660
your network right 16 gigs of your

1034
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,700
proprietary information and I walk out

1035
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,320
with it because you know Screw use noted

1036
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,480
in your Rubik's Cube It's like yeah it's

1037
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,680
like I do that

1038
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,000
that's cool

1039
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,180
I like that it's like because it's fancy

1040
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,839
but

1041
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,960
where's the other hacking tool

1042
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I made sure all my shirts are French

1043
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,980
cuffs

1044
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,480
one

1045
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,060
because of fancy

1046
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,060
and two because the cufflinks

1047
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,839
like this one

1048
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,280
here we go

1049
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,300
like this one

1050
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,079
like this one

1051
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,060
I ain't it's coming off okay

1052
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,020
that that is a threat it's like but okay

1053
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,460
okay

1054
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,800
there we go

1055
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,000
hey

1056
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,760
anybody need a wireless USB adapter

1057
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,339
plugged into your server

1058
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,920
no not at all

1059
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,960
are you going to get one yes definitely

1060
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,359
but you know some of those servers are

1061
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,800
not very cooperative

1062
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,720
you know or some of those machines

1063
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,820
aren't very Cooperative that's why you

1064
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,920
have a two gig USB drive that actually

1065
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,420
has all the wireless adapters for

1066
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Windows Linux and and Mac uh there and

1067
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,740
maybe a command and controller too you

1068
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,740
know just for fun so I turned your CEO's

1069
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,400
desk or your server into my actual

1070
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,680
wonderful you know

1071
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,420
what's that called

1072
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,640
command and control center yeah that's

1073
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,420
it

1074
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,640
and router

1075
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,920
those are fun so yes it's like I like

1076
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,240
that you can get them on Amazon I think

1077
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,859
still but you know what I love about

1078
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,940
this jacket the most

1079
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,740
it's got pockets

1080
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,680
ladies don't hate me okay

1081
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,720
I don't know why Western Society is

1082
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,520
women can have pockets and men can't

1083
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,380
wear purses because I often love my

1084
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,140
purse is amazing it's like the only

1085
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,940
problem is if I can't get a bigger purse

1086
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,020
because then you got to have the word

1087
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,240
tactical in front of it and it's like uh

1088
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,380
so it's like and this guy like have all

1089
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,119
the packages a lot of slashes and I just

1090
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,260
like something like small that just

1091
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,180
carries enough you know Hardware to

1092
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,460
actually do damage uh and I love all

1093
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,040
look at all those devices

1094
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,440
are you not intimidated and entertained

1095
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,940
how many of those devices do you need

1096
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,579
Jason none of them hardly

1097
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,820

like to show that I can carry things so

1111
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,640
I got a little drop box here uh you know

1112
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,619
that acts as like Wi-Fi pineapple it's

1113
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,000
like the Wi-Fi pineapple light don't

ah

1121
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,220
oh hidden camera so you just place that

1122
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,839
in the in the library on the shelves and

1123
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,119
stuff you know so you can take some uh

1124
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,460
CEOs type in on the passwords if you

1125
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,700
don't using the keyboard and I have oh

1126
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,900
don't I look smarter now

1127
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,079
video camera okay

1128
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,220
um

1129
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,619
and then we got a nice little old school

1130
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,780
rubber ducky uh because that looks very

1131
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,160
intimidating why would I have it like

1132
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,859
that uh another bash bunny

1133
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:28,020
there was a cell

1134
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,260
oh another little micro computer

1135
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,359
as a little Game Boy Yes this did work

1136
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,859
going into a server this is the original

1137
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,140
one the original GPD I used to break

1138
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,940
into a server once because I was playing

1139
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,760
a Nintendo kind of DS knockoff and the

1140
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,140
guy let me in because it was a three

1141
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,420
hour update uh that didn't take three

1142
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,579
hours it was I was able to Rob them in

1143
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,859
less oh

1144
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:50,579
um

1145
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:53,579
I'm not good with the whole lock picking

1146
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,599
thing remember

1147
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,180
so when I want to steal a laptop I just

1148
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,400
use these things very poorly takes me

1149
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,920
like you know way demon I'm sure you can

1150
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,859
just like look at them go like work and

1151
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,540
unlock it me it takes a little bit

1152
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,819
longer so I got these little things to

1153
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,099
take the laptop because they like to

1154
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,819
think they're secure

1155
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,980
all right waiting there we go

1156
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,819
take this off dude I feel something else

1157
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,500
where that where where oh the stop

1158
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,640
pocket

1159
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,619
voice recorder leave that line around

1160
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,240
somewhere

1161
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,540
and oh oh my gosh I would have felt so

1162
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,420
embarrassed if I forgot my Wi-Fi uh

1163
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,819
keystroke lager an injector thank you

1164
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,980
Darren again it's like so I can inject

1165
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,280
keystrokes into a machine or just record

1166
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,500
them and wirelessly translate them to my

1167
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,960
car out in the parking lot

1168
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,119
or the screen crab

1169
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,680
I love that

1170
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
because it's got HDMI you know most of

1171
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,900
the the people don't get HDMI monitors

1172
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,819
right because that's those are fancy the

1173
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,800
CEOs do

1174
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,079
you plug this one side into the CEO's

1175
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,599
monitor the other side uh uh into the

1176
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,060
output and guess what I'm now copying

1177
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,280
everything that your CEO is writing on

1178
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,280
the screen or looking at on the screen

1179
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
and either I'm taking screenshots

1180
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,760
recording it through video putting it

1181
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,980
onto a Micro SD card or I'm just

1182
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,500
transmitting it wirelessly uh to my

1183
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,960
location so I can look real time and see

1184
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,000
what it is better than soap operas

1185
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,720
so yeah I got that what the that was

1186
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,980
unexpected

1187
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,140
okay we're gonna keep this on right now

1188
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,859
but I finally to take this off so now

1189
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:37,079
we're going to look at another layer

1190
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,579
right

1191
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,920
we want to go to the passive layer

1192
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,319
what is the passive layer about

1193
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,599
well the passive layer is where I'm

1194
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,220
going to go and be a help desk person

1195
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,220
it's like you know oh I forgot to

1196
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,260
I also have like you know phone some

1197
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,260
other gadgets iPhone oh I forgot I had

1198
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,760
this like pocket I'm not packing heat

1199
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,859
I'm packing exploits everybody don't get

1200
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:02,280
nervous It's like got another bass bunny

1201
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,099
got a couple OMG cables oh my gosh these

1202
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,420
are amazing because each of these are

1203
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,160
micro computers with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

1204
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,619
that can do remote code injection uh

1205
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,900
from your hotel room which is nice

1206
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,220
especially because you get room service

1207
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,440
uh shark Jack where I don't even need a

1208
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,520
computer I just plug this into your

1209
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,280
conference uh Network Jack and this was

1210
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,020
just cool that I built I got somewhere

1211
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,060

1212
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,900
something it was just cool because it's

1213
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,000
got a Micro SD card hidden in there uh

1214
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,319
it doesn't do exploits I just thought it

1215
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,359
was cool uh and I put it in there ah

1216
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,760

business cards ever and I'm giving him a

1219
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:40,800

1228
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,079
let what does the passive roll look like

1229
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,339
well

1230
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:05,040
the passive role you know is going to

1231
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,940
look like a worker

1232
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,720
right

1233
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,359

the clipboard of Doom

1260
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,579
Dawn

1261
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,660
is there anything more fearsome

1262
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,819
more terrifying

1263
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,960
than a checklist

1264
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,760
oh you don't think so huh

1265
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,540
good to know

1266
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:39,960
right

1267
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,819
I got my clipboard to do

1268
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:46,319
and so I once again but it's got pockets

1269
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,440
okay get some other stuff in there

1270
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,000
one of the things I love the most though

1271
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,520
oh my gosh

1272
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,480
look at this

1273
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,339
the best physical compromise device in

1274
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,740
the industry

1275
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,619
there has been nothing better since its

1276
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,060
invention

1277
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,800
oh I'm not talking about the OMG cables

1278
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
those are cool mg cables are cool and

1279
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,500
everything I love them uh they're fine

1280
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,500
envelopes

1281
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,079
envelopes

1282
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,079
with a red marker because I'm in your

1283
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,140
your secret area I mean your secured

1284
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,619
area and there's offices and desks and

1285
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,079
cubicles that are unattended but you see

1286
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,000
their name

1287
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,560
really

1288
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,599
so I go over there

1289
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,640
and I just write down that person's name

1290
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,460
on the envelope

1291
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,500
I take one of my little malware USB

1292
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,859
devices

1293
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,940
and I put that on their desk

1294
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,079
and I walk away

1295
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,520
which one of your employees are not

1296
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,839
going to come back to their desk with a

1297
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,760
sealed envelope with their name on it in

1298
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,460
red and a USB drive and not plugging it

1299
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,500
in

1300
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,619
exactly I'm using human nature to do the

1301
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,240
work for me

1302
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,140
but also

1303
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,300
I'm like an ogre I've got layers it's

1304
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,400
like so I've got another layer of oops

1305
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
also got a jacket stuck there we go but

1306
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,119
yeah I've got like the Wi-Fi kind of

1307
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,099
another screen crab another cameras got

1308
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,980
like land turtles proc smart

1309
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,420
and a whole bunch of other stuff that I

1310
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,940
hardly ever use ever it's like but it

1311
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,319
looks cool to have and it intimidates

1312
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,760

flashlight

1318
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,280
especially with a high def video

1319
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,859
recorder in it

1320
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,480
spoiler alert there's no one from

1321
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,400
Egyptian security is there in here okay

1322
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,059
I literally was on a speaker tour of the

1323
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,780
Egyptian Museum in Cairo where they do

1324
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,240
expressively forbid you know uh videos

1325
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,480
and cameras and stuff and so uh I had

1326
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,480
like my my spy watch uh my spy cameras

1327
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,400
like these and the battery ran down so

1328
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,900
by the time I got to Tutankhamun's

1329
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,420
exhibit and oh my gosh it's amazing that

1330
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,859
they I mean well first of all it's

1331
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,059
amazing they still got all that stuff

1332
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,339
that you know the uh colonizers didn't

1333
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:24,780
steal from them but it's like it's like

1334
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,119
it's amazing some of the artwork that

1335
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,740
you see in there it's like the British

1336
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,260
museum would rate it in a heartbeat it's

1337
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,200
like but I didn't have any other things

1338
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,240
so I had to use the flashlight

1339
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,700
and I was literally doing like this and

1340
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,760
security was like excuse me you can't

1341
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,740
turn that flashlight on no light oh

1342
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,939
don't worry I'm not turning the light on

1343
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,099
I'm subtle ask anybody who doesn't know

1344
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:54,780
me there you go

1345
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,180
and then of course I got another USB uh

1346
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,280
pin uh this has got a laser pointer

1347
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,900
because it's cool my friend from

1348
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,300
telespace gave it to me uh I only use it

1349
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,920
to for the USB drive to like you know

1350
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,260
put stuff on it and scare people

1351
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,180
um this one oh I forgot I'd be put I

1352
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,619
don't know why I put that in there this

1353
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,020
is a device if when I when we're talking

1354
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,660
Petty to the next level uh if someone

1355
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,079
steals any of my devices in my bag I

1356
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,420
have devices like this and what it does

1357
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,859
is it just builds up an electrical

1358
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:24,599
current and destroys anything you plug

1359
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,400
it into because you shouldn't steal my

1360
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,540
stuff that is bad okay stealing is bad

1361
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,780
wait unless you're paid for it unless

1362
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,700
there's a contract let me make let me

1363
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,579
make that clear okay

1364
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:41,819
but then we get to the OMG layer

1365
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,619
oh my gosh

1366
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,559
I find myself using the OMG layer way

1367
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,440
too much okay and that's just because uh

1368
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,839
I have ADHD and I don't adult very well

1369
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,260
uh don't judge me uh so yeah when I'm

1370
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,500
doing the uh the OMG layer uh one time I

1371
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,520
was in Kingston Jamaica and I literally

1372
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,420
went in as a TV executive to hack this

1373
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,400
one thank you

1374
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,260
it's like

1375
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,640
I've used once I used a the TV producer

1376
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,380
to break into a charity organization in

1377
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,700
Kingston it was very embarrassing

1378
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,579
because I felt so bad about doing it but

1379
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,099
I was being paid to be a horrible person

1380
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,960
but my favorite

1381
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,660
is when I Rob hotels because I'll run

1382
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,000
into a hotel

1383
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,040
fully clothed going to the men's

1384
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,559
restroom staying there for about two

1385
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,440
hours don't judge it's like and then I

1386
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,240
take my clothes off

1387
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,700
and it's like and then I roll up the

1388
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,559
shirt and the jeans and the shoes and

1389
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,599
the socks and I stick them under the

1390
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,599
sink and now I'm a guest

1391
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,819

1392
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,140

1397
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,640

1398
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,680
only afford to put me into their actual

1399
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,160
hotel for one night

1400
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,960
so they put me in that low rent place

1401
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,940
right there it's like for the rest of

1402
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,680
the nights I was there uh breaking into

1403

into the management offices

1427
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,480

put the payloads on there OS detection

1443
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,680
really nice device and let's be honest

1444
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,940
this is where I do most of my attacking

1445
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,520
with it's like also if things are really

1446
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
bad

1447
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,240
you gotta

1448
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,180
got a phone you can call for help

1449
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,119
okay it's like uh I'm not gonna tell you

1450
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,740
what the name of this phone is it's sort

1451
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,740
of implied uh there it goes and then

1452
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,839
I've got and I love this because it's

1453
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,880
got It's all this is is a disposable

1454
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,520
micro SD card USB card reader you know

1455
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
why because you put a two terabyte hard

1456
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,160
drive in it uh microSD card and then you

1457
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,180
go

1458
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,140
and get

1459
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,740
yeah

1460
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,440
it's there it is and you get this little

1461
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,900
boy right here how you doing

1462
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,640
plug that out there

1463
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,940
plug that open and then there is your

1464
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,760
micro SD card that you can walk out of

1465
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,500
the company with

1466
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,420
right there on the necklace

1467
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,559
that's cool

1468
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,359
it's like so

1469
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,220
and then you just discard the micro SD

1470
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,240
card you don't keep that with you

1471
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,260
because you don't want to be found with

1472
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,880
that and that because then they're going

1473
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,260
to be looking for a Micro SD card and

1474
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,880
trust me that could get uncomfortable

1475
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:58,740
so I guess what we're trying to say is

1476
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,760
if I do find a way in and I usually do

1477
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,980
it's like uh I love the lower right one

1478
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,180
because I can't do that anymore that was

1479
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,740
me climbing seven stories above the

1480
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,440
nicosi Cypress out of a window right

1481
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,059
over the sheer drop just because the guy

1482
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:13,680
said I couldn't and I didn't like that

1483
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,720
uh and show how I could bring it to a

1484
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,920
server room and then I made them take

1485
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,359
the camera out of my jacket and take the

1486
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:20,880
picture because Petty

1487
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,500
so to make sure your employees don't

1488
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,839
have to respond once I'm there

1489
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,000
because that's the important part how

1490
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,960
long have I been going

1491
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,000
oh wow okay

1492
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,440
I'm doing I can actually show you some

1493
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,880
of the defensive stuff now because

1494
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,319
usually it's like this time I've run so

1495
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:38,880
long I'm like okay I would love to tell

1496
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,140
you how to defend against this stuff but

1497
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,359
I got to go now sorry my bad

1498
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,280
it's like y'all I feel like I haven't

1499
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,579
done that it's been very awkward so here

1500
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,099
you don't just warn your employees you

1501
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,420
show them

1502
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,359
stop giving them 10 question multiple

1503
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,700
choice every quarter and thinking that

1504
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,260
you've done your security awareness

1505
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,440
engagement

1506
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,960
gamify it make them engaged in it make

1507
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,900
them try to my friend Ben 10 actually

1508
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,660
showed me a game that one company was

1509
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,720
doing where they did no uh where's Waldo

1510
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,520
every quarter

1511
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,680
every quarter an employee would be given

1512
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,619
a badge that was exactly like their ID

1513
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,420
badge with the same exact privileges

1514
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,819
same exact code everything except for

1515
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:27,059
they replaced the person's picture

1516
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:29,280
with Waldo

1517
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,339
and the first person that detected it

1518
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,740
gotten a reward

1519
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,240
do you think people started paying

1520
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,799
attention to people wearing their badges

1521
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:39,059
or not

1522
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:41,339
yes do you think people cared about

1523
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:44,960
security more no

1524
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,859
but there was something in it for them

1525
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:49,020
now

1526
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,660
they knew what to look for

1527
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,599
they were engaged

1528
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,240
show them these kind of attacks show

1529
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,280
them what you can find on social media

1530
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,040
about your CEO because who doesn't love

1531
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,480
showing the CEO and finding stuff about

1532
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,880
it with I mean make sure you remember

1533
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,520
like the CI says Pete tells you upper

1534
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,280
management buy-in is very important okay

1535
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,319
it's like especially when you're doing

1536
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,119
that because we call that a career

1537
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,240
limiting move uh it's like so yeah but

1538
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,920
make sure you're using examples that

1539
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,540
they can relate to

1540
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,880
also interact with your employees when

1541
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,339
things aren't on fire

1542
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:29,040
how many people look at security and

1543
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,599
think that they're but the people that

1544
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:31,799
are just looking at them to find out

1545
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,460
what they did wrong

1546
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,079
if you only interact with your employees

1547
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,079
when something bad is going on

1548
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,119
what are they why would they come to you

1549
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:45,740
when something bad actually happens

1550
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,400
so there's a new iOS iOS iPad update you

1551
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,020
know yesterday or today

1552
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,880
did you send out an email company-wide

1553
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,260
letting them know they can update their

1554
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,160
iPad

1555
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,180
you don't have to tell them about the

1556
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,559
security part tell them there's new

1557
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,240
emojis or something I don't know that

1558
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,460
usually gets them

1559
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,740
but let them know when there's a new

1560
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,980
Android update or an iOS update when the

1561
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,079
FBI actually did something decent and

1562
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,700
actually sent out a thing about the

1563
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,160
D-Link routers and stuff let your

1564
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,440
employees know that let them think about

1565
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,940
security

1566
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,160
let them be security conscious let them

1567
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,380
know that you're not there just to make

1568
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,940
them fail

1569
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,740
or catch them when they're doing wrong

1570
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,839
but you're there to help secure the

1571
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,299
company and make they're sure they are

1572
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:31,319
secure

1573
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,960
do lunch and learns involve yourself

1574
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,640
with the employees just not when

1575
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,740
something bad is going on because when

1576
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,500
they accidentally click a link

1577
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,780
they'll call you in five minutes instead

1578
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,839
of you finding out in five months

1579
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,700
It's like because you know your solar

1580
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,839
winds it's like that's not good

1581
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,960
so and also this whole nonsense of

1582
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,260
chasing old days

1583
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,859
seriously

1584
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:02,760
there was a a survey like in 2015 or

1585
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,020
something like that where they said 89

1586
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,000
of vulnerabilities were over a decade

1587
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,299
old

1588
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:10,319
people talking about like you know we

1589
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,000
got to catch the low-hanging fruit you

1590
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,079
know we got to go after the low-hanging

1591
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:14,579
fruit and my mother the fruit's on the

1592
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,380
ground

1593
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,960
get a wheelbarrow

1594
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,420
pick that stuff up first

1595
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,480
you ain't ready for the tree

1596
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,040
no fruit for you from there

1597
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,839
we need to act you're talking about like

1598
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:34,020
zero days and zero trust how many people

1599
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,579
know how many machines are on their

1600
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:38,480
Network right now

1601
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,619
how many people in this company do

1602
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,260
proper Asset Management

1603
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,520
this is my judgmental look

1604
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,220
and I'm looking at you

1605
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,619
well and you too because definitely

1606
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:53,579
um

1607
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,559
so this is one of the key things we need

1608
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,520
to do

1609
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,380
the three E's

1610
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,119
I came up with myself because it's like

1611
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,640
three's you know all right educate

1612
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,280
Empower and enforce you need to start

1613
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,859
educating your employees

1614
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:09,720
letting them know what the real life

1615
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,299
kind of threats are like

1616
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:17,339
but also educating them on what to do

1617
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:21,420
when they detect something suspicious

1618
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,700
why aren't you giving them an email

1619
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,040
address to forward a suspicious email

1620
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,180
too

1621
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,040
why aren't you giving them an extension

1622
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,859
number for them to call 24 7 when they

1623
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:35,460
find someone suspicious in the building

1624
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,040
I robbed the place in Iman Jordan

1625
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,960
agreed with the manager the whole entire

1626
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,640
time I was there that I was not supposed

1627
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,780
to be there

1628
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,220
she was like you're not supposed to be

1629
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,720
there and I'm like you're right I

1630
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,480
shouldn't be doing this I you should

1631
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,859
have heard from management because I

1632
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:51,839
shouldn't be able to do this

1633
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,579
to any of these computers I mean if you

1634
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:54,839
don't know

1635
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,240
why I'm doing this that I shouldn't five

1636
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,540
times

1637
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,460
with me agreeing with her

1638
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,799
and I asked her when it was over because

1639
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,480
I don't do red teaming I do security

1640
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,339
awareness engagements it's teachable

1641
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:11,099
moments not testing it's like I don't

1642
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:13,799
give them losses I give them lessons and

1643
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:16,140
so after I finished an engagement I will

1644
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,819
come back two minutes later and talk to

1645
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,799
every single person I compromised talked

1646
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,599
to that manager like you knew I wasn't

1647
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,220
supposed to be there why didn't you call

1648
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,660
someone

1649
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,020
why didn't you have someone stop me

1650
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,180
and she was like no one told me what to

1651
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,700
do no one gave me a number to call

1652
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,520
I had no number for security

1653
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,900
how was that her fail

1654
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,180
how was that on her

1655
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,299
that was on the security team

1656
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:47,579
they caused that breach to happen well I

1657
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,020
caused the bridge to happen but it's

1658
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,819
like you know they were responsible for

1659
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:53,339
not telling their employees what to do

1660
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:55,500
we need to educate them

1661
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,020
we need to empower them to do it and

1662
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,500
mother why aren't we enforcing it

1663
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,900
how many links does bobbin accounting

1664
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,119
sorry Bobs and accounting people does he

1665
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:08,220
get to click on

1666
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,400
before we realize maybe he's The Insider

1667
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,099
threat where we should be worried about

1668
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,740
people looking for maliciousness instead

1669
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,900
of incompetence

1670
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,079
if a van driver wrecks a van

1671
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,299
they may get one warning

1672
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,579
they wreck it three times they're not

1673
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:28,020
working there anymore

1674
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,599
your computer is equipment that can

1675
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:33,000
cause millions of dollars in damage fire

1676
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,760
them if they keep clicking links if they

1677
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,140
keep showing that they are a threat to

1678
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,119
your internal security

1679
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,099
that's what guidelines and policies are

1680
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:44,780
for start enforcing them

1681
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,530
y'all think I'm joking I'm doing

1682
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:08,479
