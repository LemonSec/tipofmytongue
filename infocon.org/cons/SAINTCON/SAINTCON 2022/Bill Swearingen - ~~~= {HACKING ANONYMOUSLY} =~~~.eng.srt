00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,300
well hey everybody uh I'm Bill

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,500
Swearingen today we're going to be

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,719
talking about hacking anonymously

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,519
um thanks for coming to my talk I

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,839
appreciate it

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,820
um a little bit about me I've been doing

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,039
this for a long time uh so I've kind of

12
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,140
been in the hacking scene

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,119
um really before I even knew that I was

14
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,740
in the hacking scene

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,660
um I was kind of just thinking back like

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,119
okay so when did I really kind of get

17
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,679
into hacking and I can kind of really

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,140
put it down too I remember when I was

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,559
probably about 12 years old I got on my

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,800
bike and I rode it to a pay phone and

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
red boxed a phone call to Nintendo to

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079
for the helpline right I think that's

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,700
kind of where I started at that time I

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,440
didn't even know what I was doing I

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,480
didn't really know I was hacking

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,579
um freaking whatever and that really

27
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,920
kind of got me into this like I I just I

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
really need to understand really need to

29
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,879
explore and you know kind of Tinker a

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,079
little bit

31
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,760
um so for those of you that don't know

32
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,600
me

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,560
um I've been I've spoke at Defcon I am a

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,439
founder of SEC KC let's hear for SEC AC

35
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,020
if anybody's heard of him nobody

36
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,560
oh a couple are great um and I I started

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
the the Kansas City hacker space as well

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,180
um so that's just a little bit about me

39
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,960
so real quick uh a quick disclaimer look

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,479
I we're not here to be criminals I'm not

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,100
here to teach you how to break the law

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,460
right what I'm here to do is is to help

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,380
educate a little bit

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,880
um I'm not here to be your mama either

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,439
so whatever you want to do with this

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,540
information I don't care

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,840
um I'm here because some of y'all are

48
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,439
idiots

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,880
and I mean that okay but no offense to

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,740
the other ones um

51
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,299
so a little bit more about me uh so in

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,920
my working career I've done a lot of the

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
same things you all have done I've I've

54
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,420
worked on the help desk

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,240
um I've worked it on the blue team uh

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,219
you know I've I've been on certs I've

57
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,500
been on thread Intel teams

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,258
um and ultimately where I ended up was I

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,660
was the CSO for one of the world just

60
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
the world's largest telecommunications

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,360
companies and and so when I when I have

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,540
some uh let's say background in

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,640
investigations

64
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,860
um believe me I I do

65
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,560
um after after working for the Telco I

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,260
went to ironet and I was uh the lead

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,560
responsible for all of our high profile

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,319
investigations in IR since ironette I've

69
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,060
left I've started my own company with a

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,519
couple Founders and we provide cyber

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,620
security services for ultra high net

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,840
worth individuals so uh you know just

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,360
that's a little history about me but

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,280
one of the things I really really want

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
to convey to you so if you if you only

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,879
take a couple things away from this

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,760
presentation today is that we truly are

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,459
living in a very interesting time in

79
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,480
history

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,060
okay so one of the things that you you

81
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,700
probably already know but I really want

82
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,760
to make sure that that I hammer home is

83
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
that the capabilities that are available

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,860
to our governments across the world are

85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,040
simply unbelievable

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,560
okay think about what we learned from

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,180
the Snowden Revelations and they've

88
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
they've only gotten better over time

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,739
okay if you take a look at what's

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,300
happening in in Ukraine or in China

91
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,239
we're seeing massive governments putting

92
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,400
in a lot of restrictions and a lot of

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,000
you know like uh uh just trying to hold

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,239
down the community right and so what

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,099
we've seen over the last couple years is

96
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,019
we've started to see the community rise

97
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,659
up right so not only are we in a in a

98
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,180
point of time where we have extreme

99
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,400
government oversight but we also have

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,099
the hacking Community rising up and

101
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,840
creating our own tools and our own

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,180
capabilities to thwart a lot of the

103
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,400
protections or you know the the the the

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,739
restrictions that are put in place and

105
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,420
they're available to us on the internet

106
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,720
uh fairly as as a U.S citizen pretty

107
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,959
easily able to to get and so I just kind

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,159
of wanted to go through some of those

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,239
with you

110
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,978
um so I I just want to make sure that uh

111
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,880
as we talk these I put this presentation

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
together using a lot of resources online

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
with a little bit of my background to

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,560
say yes this is a good idea or hey this

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
is how I would how I would do that but

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,460
I'll call those out as as we go through

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,020
um okay actually before we move on

118
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,600
um okay I I can kind of see the crowd is

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,699
this anybody's first saint con

120
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,100
wow look at that okay this is my first

121
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,720
ain't contou

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
um and so I just want to hear it like

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,380
let's put our hands together for the

124
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,860
saint con uh orchestrators what an

125
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,759
amazing conference

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
I got it I gotta tell you I was I was

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
simply blown away at this conference and

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,060
I I really appreciate St Khan for

129
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,160
putting this on okay so first things

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,940
first now this is the basic of the basic

131
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,020
right we're going to get a lot more

132
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,880
deeper into this but as everyone

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,460
probably in this audience

134
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,400
um is aware is is your your IP address

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
what you connect to the internet

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,979
um is your identifier right if I know

137
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,520
your IP address as an investigator more

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
than likely I'm going to be able to get

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,020
your identity I'm going to be able to

140
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
identify you and I'm going to be able to

141
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,639
high-five myself uh investigation done

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,220
right but one of the things that you may

143
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,919
not do you may not know is that your

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,660
internet service providers again I

145
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,880
worked for a major Telco they can see

146
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
everything that you do online everything

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,100
in fact so a lot of the times uh what we

148
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,800
what we would do is uh think about uh

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,620
you know in that last mile we would have

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,320
uh Taps right after right where you

151
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,419
where your router connects to our

152
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,340
Network we would have Taps there where

153
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,680
we would gather statistics okay and it

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,060
would be all the things that you you can

155
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,100
imagine right it wouldn't be it would be

156
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,979
more around for performance or uh you

157
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,539
know or you know just that you know

158
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,340
statistics and those kind of things but

159
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,440
they're very valuable investigations but

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,720
just before we get going on please make

161
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,580
sure that you're aware that your isps

162
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,139
they can see every website that you

163
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,080
visit the time that you spent there you

164
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
know that what you know what kind of

165
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
content you're watching

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,900
um the device that you're using

167
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,600
um and your geographic location so

168
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,340
specifically as we start talking about

169
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,740
isps think about

170
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,120
um in your home

171
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,819
when you're connected to you know your

172
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,520
ISP of choice whatever that is the

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,740
device that you're using right that they

174
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,319
become that's leased from the company

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,900
maintains logs okay

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,759
um and and so there are ways when you

177
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,380
start thinking through this right that

178
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,800
you can uh you can remove your device's

179
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,199
Mac addresses or addresses from that

180
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,940
device you could have your own separate

181
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,500
Network

182
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,900
um underneath the the uh the ISP

183
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,940
delivered router right

184
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,039
um but we'll get into all that here in a

185
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,900
little bit but the point that I really

186
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,600
wanted to tell you is isps usually

187
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,080
retain records of devices and IP

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,599
addresses for about seven years

189
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,240
okay and so that that they would uh that

190
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,099
would be the least times uh you know the

191
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,139
lease IPS and the lease times that you

192
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,539
had the devices that connected it to

193
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,160
that um to that router that they

194
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,720
provided or that you know device they

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
provided to you

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
um but also when we start really looking

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,259
at uh the capabilities that are

198
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,479
available to us as investigators

199
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,699
social networks usually keep them much

200
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,400
longer right usually it's indefinite

201
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
um keep that in mind as we move forward

202
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,599
so okay what's our first path as a

203
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,699
hacker and we want to start becoming

204
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,500
anonymous online well we already know

205
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
well we're going to obfuscate our IP

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,319
address right

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,060
um and and one of the things that you

208
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,400
may not recognize some of you do of

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,919
course but your DNS request you also

210
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,080
have to have a strategy for number one

211
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,360
obfuscating IP address we'll get to that

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
but also into into your DNS request as

213
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,740
well right so ways that we can do this

214
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,080
this is not I'm not teaching anyone new

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,840
here hey we can just join a public Wi-Fi

216
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,900
right then I'm using Starbucks IP

217
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,780
address I'm using Starbucks DNS maybe

218
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,279
right

219
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,099
um of course I can use Tor right

220
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,899
um and then of course and then you know

221
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,179
maybe there's a VPN that we're

222
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,799
leveraging well I'm just going to tell

223
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,419
you none of those are perfect and we'll

224
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,279
go into all of the reasons why in

225
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,120
today's talk but never ever ever hack

226
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,760
from home okay ever I'm just going to

227
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,040
tell you if you are like committing

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,399
crimes from home attacking or whatever

229
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
don't you're going to get caught right

230
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,260
so my advice to you is to never ever

231
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,940
hack from home unless it's authorized

232
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,459
right or some TLC Home Improvement

233
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,920
 right so hard house hacks

234
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
whatever

235
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
um okay so how did this talk even come

236
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,420
together and and I'm not kidding you

237
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,880
this is exactly how this talk came

238
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,860
together I was sitting on my couch and I

239
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,140
have a cat and the cat was like

240
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,720
on me or whatever and I'm watching

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,720
YouTube and every single YouTube video

242
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,500
is sponsored by some VPN company that is

243
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,720
claiming that they're you know

244
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,779
completely 100 percent Anonymous they're

245
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,240
secure they don't they don't keep any

246
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
logs the second you disconnect they

247
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,180
light the data center on fire and you

248
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,860
know and and and everything I'm just

249
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,440
like bro it's not how it works so just

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,420
if you take a look at this if you take a

251
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,399
look at this document or this screenshot

252
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,740
here this I didn't put this together I

253
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,500
literally pulled this off of YouTube uh

254
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,839
from a VPN provider and they they

255
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,180
basically if I if I can like you know

256
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,399
look at this it's basically saying that

257
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,040
if I use their VPN I'm protected against

258
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,019
all cyber criminals and all the

259
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,880
governments I can just use the internet

260
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,000
right well I I don't I don't think

261
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,860
that's right

262
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,959
okay so one of the things when you have

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,480
when you're using a VPN think about how

264
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,300
did you buy this VPN

265
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,560
right did you connect to star vpn.com

266
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
from your laptop that you always use

267
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,959
from your home Wi-Fi

268
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,899
right did you use your credit card to

269
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,399
buy this VPN

270
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,260
all right so

271
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
think you know just think about it when

272
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,560
we when we really start putting together

273
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,800
like our threat model about what the VPN

274
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,959
provides right you also need to think

275
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,880
about what information of you do they

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,300
have now when we start going into vpns a

277
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,760
little bit no matter what VPN providers

278
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,700
say and I don't care like I don't care

279
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,240
what they say it is they do retain some

280
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,000
sort of logs okay let me give you a good

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,279
example all right who here has ever

282
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,839
worked in I.T right everybody right okay

283
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,459
uh so you get a phone call at two

284
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,800
o'clock in the morning and says hey this

285
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
you know really important user of ours

286
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,760
that pays five dollars a month uh you

287
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
know their VPN isn't providing you know

288
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,240
isn't isn't working correctly and I need

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,420
you to diagnose it uh sorry boss we

290
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,279
don't have any logs right they're

291
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,320
keeping some sort of logs right they're

292
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,160
they're also uh how do they you know of

293
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,959
course there's probably logs about when

294
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
you log in how long your your account

295
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,519
lasts all of these different things but

296
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,620
but most importantly the thing that you

297
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,200
have to to understand is that these VPN

298
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,920
providers are companies and they are

299
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,160
located in countries that have laws

300
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,380
right and regardless of what statements

301
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,500
they make when it comes down to it your

302
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,959
five dollars a month is not worth losing

303
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,420
their business about so let's put it to

304
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,540
the test okay let's actually think about

305
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,540
and let's let's look at history of how

306
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,820
well these these service providers have

307
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,980
protected us okay I know you're probably

308
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,019
in the back probably can't read this but

309
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,540
we all love protonmail to send out our

310
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,260
spam right well in 2021 they Implement

311
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,720
they uh they logged IP address of a

312
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,579
French activist and turn it over to the

313
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,440
authorities right I'm not going to go

314
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
through all of these but we've seen

315
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,720
we've seen windscribe double VPN we've

316
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,200
seen two tenota many times be leveraged

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,540
which is a germany-based company that

318
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,019
that screams privacy uh has been

319
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,820
compelled to provide information of

320
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,500
their users

321
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,740
okay so just keep this in mind and look

322
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,220
again don't don't be criminals don't

323
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,399
cause people problems but but also

324
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,220
recognize that these VPN providers that

325
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,920
they're not providing you any they're

326
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,200
not making you Anonymous they they can

327
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,980
be compelled to disclose Who You Are

328
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,240
so

329
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,519
let's talk about some good VPN advice

330
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
okay so first of all and I've already

331
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,420
mentioned the threat model but one of

332
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,380
the things that you need to think about

333
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,540
is okay what what is the purpose of you

334
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,600
using this VPN and I know and I know

335
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
that many of you in this audience are

336
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,779
probably way more technical than I am

337
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,639
when it comes to networking but what is

338
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,220
the purpose of using a VPN right it

339
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,959
could be it could be a couple different

340
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,579
things right it could be to protect your

341
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,500
your local traffic your traffic on this

342
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,019
local network right it may be that you

343
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,540
need an exit point in a geographically

344
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,579
different area right

345
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,959
um it but but is it to become anonymous

346
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,139
no no so really you're just you're

347
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,880
moving your exit note onto the internet

348
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,860
to it to a different location right

349
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,160
maybe as a as a previous ISP provider

350
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,320
you don't want me to know uh what

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,820
YouTube videos you're watching right so

352
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,220
think about what your what what the what

353
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,720
your real threat model is with that with

354
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,060
a VPN provider and then Implement an

355
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,120
accord a counter strategy accordingly

356
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
okay

357
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,260
um so if if you're truly after a

358
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,040
somewhat Anonymous VPN uh subscribe uh

359
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
to a VPN uh using Tor right never

360
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
connect to it from your home IP address

361
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,360
and find a VPN provider that would

362
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,940
accept a privacy based cryptocurrency

363
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,459
such as Monero whatever and so the only

364
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,500
reason I would suggest this is like Okay

365
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,959
so let's let's just say you just got

366
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,240
done hacking whoever

367
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
and they tracked it back to your VPN

368
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,620
provider and they think were compelled

369
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,019
to deliver whatever logs that they had

370
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,760
um you you want to make it as difficult

371
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,980
as you can for for them to identify you

372
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,800
uh well you know that their IP address

373
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,260
it looks like it was a tour node they

374
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,600
used Monero as payment you know their

375
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,440
their user ID user ID wasn't Bill swear

376
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,420
engine right you know like make sure

377
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
that you're like think think think this

378
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,180
through

379
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,300
um also do your own research um about

380
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,579
VPN providers and and never ever tell

381
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,880
anybody hey I use this VPN service right

382
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,579
you know just come on good upset there

383
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,500
okay so vpns look yearly used Tour all

384
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,540
right okay what we're going to get much

385
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,579
more into tour here in a little bit but

386
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,440
if both I just want to tell you right

387
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,620
away and the tour project is is

388
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,959
fantastic I I love I love the tour

389
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,940
project uh there's been a lot of

390
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,100
disinformation that has come out

391
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,959
um from governments about using Tor

392
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,940
right um if you really want to see

393
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,100
disinformation go look at people that

394
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,380
that talk negatively about tour some of

395
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,360
it might be good I don't know but um

396
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,699
but yes there are strategies that

397
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,920
governments take to de-anonymize tour

398
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,339
right if if there is a suspect if I

399
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,620
believe that you are the suspect in this

400
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,820
case

401
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,360
um I can monitor the time of access and

402
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,399
the amount of data that is that is that

403
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,079
gets brought into the net tour Network

404
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,500
and exiting if I monitor to those things

405
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,199
I can start a de-anonymize you there

406
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,720
there are strategies that that can be in

407
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,120
place uh that can be used to

408
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,100
de-anonymize tour like I said we're

409
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,240
going to come back to that here in a

410
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,139
little bit

411
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,760
um I just want to tell you it's it's not

412
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,459
bulletproof okay

413
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,720
okay

414
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,339
I know I've already said this I'm just

415
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,959
going to keep saying it every slide but

416
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,480
if you take away nothing this is the

417
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,220
rant part of the talk and this is what

418
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,660
my favorite part where I just get a gap

419
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,259
here and like yell at you okay so

420
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,480
do not hack from home you will make a

421
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,920
mistake

422
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,800
all right how many times like you

423
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
criminals been there and you look down

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,399
and wire like wire guards didn't

425
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,199
disconnect and you just start panicking

426
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,459
because like when did it disconnect

427
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,779
right

428
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,279
um that's not how you're going to get

429
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,839
caught you're going to get caught

430
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,120
because you're using the same laptop

431
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,240
that you used for work you're using the

432
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,639
same laptop that you use for home you're

433
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,859
gonna like accidentally be logged into

434
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,079
Instagram or Facebook or Google or

435
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,280
something

436
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,599
um and this is how you're going to get

437
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,959
caught no matter how much energy

438
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,819
you put

439
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,319
into having a a different identity using

440
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,699
vpns and tours you know or tour you're

441
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,559
gonna this is how you're gonna get burnt

442
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,439
okay and I'm going to tell you a

443
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,660
strategy on how to get around this but

444
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,660
all of these all of these social

445
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,120
networks number one they retain

446
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,000
information about your computer and your

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,880
habits um indefinitely they're using

448
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
that information to make their networks

449
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,299
better

450
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,860
all right and the minute that you log in

451
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,360
to uh one of these services and you

452
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
don't even really have to even log in if

453
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
you were just to hit an uh an asset of

454
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,260
one of these uh you you go to a website

455
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,919
that has a Facebook login uh button just

456
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
that action if if you're using a laptop

457
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,460
that you've previously logged into

458
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,860
Facebook with that's all that that

459
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,360
really that we need in order to start uh

460
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,520
de-anonymizing you right so so do not

461
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,500
hack from home you will make a mistake

462
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
and when you look down and you see that

463
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,620
you're logged into Google on this laptop

464
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,860
even though you're using a tour browser

465
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,600
a brave browser or whatever you look

466
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
down and you see that you're logged into

467
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,140
one of these Services I just got to tell

468
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,840
you you're burned okay so like you're

469
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,360
just it's it's the end and so you really

470
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,799
need a different strategy on how we're

471
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,360
going to do this

472
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,880
okay so how do we how do we stop that

473
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,679
well first of all you got to remember

474
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,660
your opsec so I just want to tell you

475
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,980
something if you haven't seen this

476
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,539
already

477
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,480
um your computer your the your main

478
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,360
computer that you use it stands out like

479
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,240
a blinking light to everyone it looks

480
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
just like Jason e Street's luggage at

481
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,940
SLC International like and if you

482
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,679
haven't seen it like you just you can

483
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,559
see oh this belongs to you know somebody

484
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,740
this belongs to a hacker okay we all

485
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,419
know this hopefully you guys can see

486
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,679
this but

487
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,539
um without any tricks or with without

488
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,000
any you know like

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,660
um

490
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,520
well tricks the the site or the the the

491
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,340
asset that you're accessing remotely is

492
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,200
obviously able to in order for you to

493
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,299
connect to it obviously it has to be

494
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,580
able to get to your IP address right and

495
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,919
uh we we all probably know that IP

496
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,160
addresses can uh be geolocated uh pretty

497
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,860
pretty succinctly now right so I don't

498
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,200
know if you can see this but this is I

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,620
just went to privacy dot whatever

500
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,740
privacy.net and it showed me my IPv6 and

501
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,179
it also told me that I was located in

502
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,039
Lenexa Kansas and I was using Charter

503
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,140
Communication as my ISP

504
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,360
um it told me my browser and it told me

505
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,900
my OS right we we pretty much all know

506
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,200
this okay that's not a surprise but but

507
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,559
again using very very similar tricks

508
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,320
we're able to fingerprint these

509
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,020
computers without running any code so

510
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,480
without running any code this website

511
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,520
privacy.net was able to create a

512
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,380
fingerprint that would that would

513
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,900
individually identify this laptop right

514
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,900
here without storing any cookies without

515
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,380
without it running any code locally

516
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,600
because of my uh the the browser that

517
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,260
I'm using the OS that I'm using the

518
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,840
screen size that I'm using Etc is able

519
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,360
to provide a fingerprint of this

520
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,539
specific machine that could be used to

521
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,760
identify me later

522
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,100
okay so

523
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,860
um so just keep that in mind even if we

524
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,780
were to have gone through everything

525
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,160
with the VPN right we super hackers we

526
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,900
went to we went to

527
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,299
Starbucks

528
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,660
and then we connected a tour

529
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,220
and then we bought a VPN with Monero and

530
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,919
then we connected to that VPN and then

531
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,440
we we hacked Sony

532
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,240
that doesn't change the fingerprint of

533
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,620
this device that's still being

534
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,320
communicated okay so that route to the

535
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,179
internet even though it's it we did

536
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,120
everything to protect our opsec just

537
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,280
because we forgot about the fingerprint

538
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,039
of our device we can still be identified

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,419
potentially okay

540
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,600
so um keeping going we live in a very

541
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,419
modern age that you should know that

542
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,460
your os's are spying on you all of them

543
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,740
all of them like all of them are spying

544
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
on you

545
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,039
um and and so there are a lot of

546
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,080
physical identifiers that you need to

547
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,600
have a strategy on on how to protect

548
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,760
when you're online and if you want to

549
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,740
stay Anonymous of course the ones that

550
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,539
everybody knows is our Mac address or

551
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,880
our Bluetooth addresses right but did

552
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,760
you know that your CPU has a has a

553
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,919
management platform that has been

554
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,220
remotely compromised the Intel

555
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,600
management platform has been remotely

556
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
compromised before that there's been

557
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,740
some exploits for that that can read all

558
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,559
of those addresses remotely right

559
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,380
um OS is is keeping like Windows and Mac

560
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,600
are keeping Telemetry on how you use

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,360
that machine a lot of applications do as

562
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,780
well when if you were to buy a Macbook

563
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,559
okay actually Eric let's rewind

564
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,140
uh we're going to take hey I got this

565
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,799
brand new M2 laptop and it's replacing

566
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,500
my last MacBook and so what I'm going to

567
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,539
do is I'm going to wipe that map book

568
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,940
that original one I'm going to use it as

569
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,159
my hack top so that I can hack all of

570
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,460
these companies guess what Apple has

571
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,320
already knows who this MacBook was

572
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,840
registered to right so you got to be

573
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,400
very very careful when you're when

574
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,340
you're working with a a laptop or or a

575
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,260
you know or a computer of any wave

576
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,179
that's been activated with Microsoft

577
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,640
that's been registered with apple right

578
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,679
though just because you've formatted

579
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,559
that machine and and maybe registered it

580
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,960
with a new person or a new identity or

581
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
whatever that doesn't negate the fact

582
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,740
that that evidence Still Remains that

583
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,480
that machine may have belonged to you in

584
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,580
the past okay

585
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,340
um let's see

586
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,860
um oh also did you know that most

587
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,380
laptops even when turned off

588
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,440
uh keep the ble radio still on

589
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,200
so even if your laptop was turned off

590
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,559
your your uh your your laptop your phone

591
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,080
whatever may still be beaconing for

592
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,780
Bluetooth low energy right and so what

593
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,380
this could allow to happen or what what

594
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,559
the investigators could use there is was

595
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,720
this device anywhere near this area even

596
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,880
if I had it turned off it still may have

597
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,559
pinged the Bluetooth and we could we

598
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,480
could identify that machine as being

599
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,140
local during a certain time so really

600
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,900
the best advice I can give you here is

601
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,400
in the event that you want to stay

602
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,440
Anonymous for whatever reason uh maybe

603
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,780
you know it doesn't have to be uh

604
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,460
malicious reasons that there could be

605
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,620
media reasons or you just want to stay

606
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,400
Anonymous is buy a laptop with cash they

607
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,620
cannot be easily identified to you

608
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,059
through uh you know whatever the the

609
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,340
local marketplaces are

610
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,799
um you know that you have here

611
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,700
um and also you know never ever use that

612
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,200
that machine

613
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,159
um

614
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,020
never connect that machine to your home

615
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,200
Wi-Fi right create a completely separate

616
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,299
identity that when you're using that

617
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,640
that machine you act as a different

618
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,120
person that way you kind of negate that

619
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,159
whole logging into Facebook or Instagram

620
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,880
or YouTube or or whatever but just keep

621
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,820
that in mind okay

622
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,440
um okay so I kind of already touched on

623
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
this but um let me tell you something

624
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,159
these things these these phones right

625
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,480
here

626
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,280
um for whatever reason let's say that

627
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,679
you wanted to communicate you are a uh

628
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,900
you're in a in a

629
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,140
in in a media unfriendly part of the

630
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,400
world

631
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,380
um and you want to make sure and you

632
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,200
need to get a story out or something

633
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,059
well you know that your phones are are

634
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,880
tracking you okay so and and I love it

635
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,860
like one of the best things like I love

636
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,140
that my phone I can go see like oh where

637
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,940
did I go last year and you know I can

638
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,799
see all the places I've been we all know

639
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
that it's doing it it's okay you can

640
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,460
turn it off if you want it but uh the

641
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,559
the best plan here is if you have a

642
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,779
smartphone get a you know get a burner

643
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,580
phone and leave your smartphone at home

644
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,760
and leave it playing a a video or

645
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,740
something so you you're you can build in

646
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,740
some uh you know some reason reasonable

647
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,260
uh deniability that that you were not in

648
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,880
these locations

649
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,740
um one of the things that I just think

650
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,140
that most people don't understand

651
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,940
um probably to the to the level that

652
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,799
this is happening is that private

653
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,179
companies have access to this

654
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,740
geolocation

655
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,500
um and and can be and can determine if a

656
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,440
device if any device was in an area at

657
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,120
any certain time let me give you an

658
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,880
example of how that works so so in the

659
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,740
event that we wanted to track somebody

660
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,460
down we through whatever means we find

661
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,039
that it's coming from this uh it came

662
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,620
from this Starbucks uh you know this

663
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,380
this IP address uh there are data sets

664
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,880
that can be purchased they're quite

665
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,460
expensive but but available to uh to

666
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,679
private companies and and governments of

667
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,760
course

668
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,820
um that that uh that can show the every

669
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,740
device that was in that area at that

670
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,360
certain time so those are called

671
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
geofencing geofencing warrants

672
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,179
um see if I get that word out

673
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,620
um and they're starting to become very

674
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,659
very widely used

675
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,720
okay so keep that in mind if if you're

676
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,580
going to be needing to stay super

677
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,000
Anonymous leave your uh cell phone um

678
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,500
please

679
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,000
okay

680
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,100
so let's uh take a breather I know I've

681
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,539
been screaming at you here for 20

682
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,559
minutes now

683
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,100
um

684
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,400
just a real quick recap so uh have a

685
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,799
dedicated computer okay if you truly

686
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,900
want to stay Anonymous uh there's really

687
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,760
nothing you can do with the computer

688
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,559
that you've been using

689
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,520
um to to make it Move Yourself to that

690
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,080
to that level that you're looking for so

691
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,059
buy something dedicated like I mentioned

692
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,400
create another person Persona that

693
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,960
Persona is the person that uses that

694
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,059
other laptop that Persona does not live

695
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,440
in your house so don't ever connect it

696
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,980
to your home Wi-Fi in the event that

697
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,740
you're wanting to use a VPN make sure

698
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,080
you you purchase it with with Monero

699
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
make sure you do you connect to it over

700
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,179
tour and don't use social networks

701
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,919
okay moving on

702
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,380
um I do want to talk about real quick

703
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,900
um is building so you've purchased that

704
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,120
computer and you want to start building

705
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,320
it out

706
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,580
um so to be a very uh clever

707
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,559
and very like resistant to investigation

708
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,320
uh laptop

709
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,760
so my advice

710
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,279
um that this most of this advice uh came

711
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,260
out I'll have the link here in a little

712
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,600
bit where they they walk you through

713
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,419
step by step by step and I'll set this

714
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,279
up but this comes from The Hitchhiker's

715
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,679
Guide to an amenity

716
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,360
um for the for full setup and there's

717
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,400
some really clever reasons why we do

718
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,220
these things the way that we do again I

719
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,380
did not create these but I agree with

720
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,640
all of the statements that were made

721
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,220
here so your base OS Windows 11 home

722
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,440
there's a reason

723
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,000
um it when you go into your bios or

724
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,820
UEFI make sure that you set up both a

725
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,559
you know set up passwords for everything

726
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,620
for boot up for setup and on hard drives

727
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,340
uh disable Bluetooth in the Bios disable

728
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,460
any management interfaces that that may

729
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,919
exist in in the in the Bios a lot of

730
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,559
times you don't have access to this but

731
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,360
as you're installing uh your your

732
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,779
windows home uh this disable the OS

733
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,240
Telemetry there's guides in that in

734
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,059
there as well and then and then finally

735
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,220
you want to use veracrypt full disk

736
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,980
encryption with plausible deniability

737
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,899
deniability I'll get into that in a

738
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,940
second with memory encryption and memory

739
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,580
wipe when you insert a USB device okay

740
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,600
so why Windows Home 11 or Windows 11

741
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,620
home

742
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,679
well so a very interesting feature of

743
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,000
Windows 11 home is it does not come with

744
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,340
BitLocker by default

745
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,159
okay and so in the event that you can

746
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,980
imagine like uh someone were to steal

747
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,140
your laptop they they believe that you

748
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,740
have you have uh you're a reporter

749
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,120
um and and you've disclosed some

750
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,380
information that you should have and

751
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,779
they take your machine from you and they

752
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,880
the investigator goes to look at your

753
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,940
machine and they find Windows Home 11 or

754
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,000
Windows 11 home and they've got and

755
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,700
you've got veracrypt installed

756
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,980
right now you have pliant you have

757
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,899
plausible deniability if somebody would

758
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,320
say well Bill why why do you have

759
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,279
veracrypt installed on this machine and

760
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,799
you can say well I take security very

761
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,980
seriously I wanted to to encrypt my

762
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,820
machine and I you know and windows 11

763
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,580
home does not permit me to do this so I

764
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,640
went with a third party to you know the

765
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,179
third party software to do that okay

766
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:40,320
well we're going to need you to decrypt

767
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,840
your laptop Bill like okay well because

768
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I've set up plausible deniability in

769
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,320
veracrypt I can so for those of you that

770
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,080
have not seen that it's basically uh two

771
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,600
it's layered encryption if you give one

772
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,000
password you get this result and if you

773
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,820
give a separate password you get a

774
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,919
completely separate result that separate

775
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,559
result could be your hidden OS right so

776
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,299
it would look something like this

777
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,659
so you would have um your Deco your

778
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,700
decoy operating system that being our

779
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
Windows 11 home

780
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,740
um and then when you start to decrypt if

781
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,020
you were to give the uh you know the the

782
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,659
plausible deniability password it opens

783
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,520
up that outer volume where you would

784
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,320
leave some evidence for the

785
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,720
investigators to find okay it doesn't

786
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,880
matter what it could be documents

787
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,640
um it could be pictures or you know

788
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,860
maybe like some movies or something you

789
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,600
know something that you like I didn't

790
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,100
really want anybody to find the movies

791
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,080
that I downloaded or whatever but that

792
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,720
that exists in that outer volume and it

793
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,460
gives you some reason for you to have

794
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,820
encrypted that that volume meanwhile uh

795
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,159
you have a a separate uh hidden volume

796
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,460
that contains uh your actual uh

797
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,620
operating system that you would be in

798
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,140
your hidden operating system

799
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,779
um again I'm not going I don't have the

800
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,539
time nor am I going to talk you through

801
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,460
the setup of this but The Hitchhiker's

802
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,240
Guide

803
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,419
has a step-by-step-by-step installation

804
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,399
and configuration for all of these

805
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,100
things it's also worth noting

806
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,440
um you know that that you need to be

807
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,200
very careful about memory encryption

808
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,140
um and so there have been attacks on on

809
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,600
this you've probably seen

810
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,299
um that you can retrieve memory uh even

811
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,700
when the machine's turned off

812
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,159
um and so but veracrypt has ways of

813
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,799
wiping the keys when your machine goes

814
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,640
into into hibernate or when a USB stick

815
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,919
is stuck in and I would really recommend

816
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,320
that you do both of those things

817
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,820
um at the end it's going to look like

818
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,919
this like you have talked hack top is

819
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,299
going to look something like this at the

820
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,260
end

821
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,340
um and I just kind of want to talk

822
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,799
through this a little bit

823
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,659
so basically what we would have is in

824
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,360
our decoy OS we would disable all

825
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,159
internet right the way that we would do

826
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,200
that is we would remove the Gateway IP

827
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,740
address from that Windows Home machine

828
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,020
we would then have uh that veracrypt

829
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,600
setup you know in a way that we could

830
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,940
run virtualbox running off of that Decoy

831
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,840
OS volume right and then we would pipe

832
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,919
all of our uh all of our internet using

833
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,159
wapix bridge over to tour all right I

834
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,980
understand this looks complicated but

835
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,480
it's really not that bad once you set

836
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,919
that up but what you've what you've done

837
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,440
in in this setup right here is is

838
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
completely create a scenario where

839
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,700
you're not going to make any mistakes

840
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,740
right so you're forcing your connections

841
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,919
over tour you're using hidden os's you

842
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,799
know you like doing super spy

843
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,279
um and it's all fun I know that's a

844
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,600
complicated slide but believe me it

845
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,760
doesn't take much to get there

846
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,899
okay so um I get this question a lot

847
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,740
um so okay so once I connect the tour

848
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,779
um should I add a VPN over tour so

849
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,519
should I VPN over tour should I tour

850
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,200
over VPN

851
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,059
um and both of them are

852
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,300
um there's a there's yeses to both

853
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,300
um again Tor is a a fantastic uh

854
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,918
capability

855
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,139
um but again

856
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,179
um it's just it's really just changing

857
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,000
where your IP address lands right so if

858
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,139
you remember back when we were talking

859
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,820
about the social networks and all of

860
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,379
those kind of things that's how you're

861
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,879
going to get burned right even if you're

862
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,399
using Tor and you hit a v uh you know

863
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,980
you hit a Facebook login

864
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,780
um it's going to de-anonymize you right

865
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,219
there right so just make sure you

866
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,960
consider that but

867
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,119
um considering your threat model so okay

868
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,159
so if you if you have established a tour

869
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,260
connection

870
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,780
um and and you're connected to tour and

871
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,179
then you create a VPN connection you're

872
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,599
actually reducing the security of Tor

873
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
um it bypasses towards
