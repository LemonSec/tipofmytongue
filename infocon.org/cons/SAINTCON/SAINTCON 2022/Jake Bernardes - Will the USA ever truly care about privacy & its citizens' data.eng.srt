1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
whose first time is this not who's been

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,080
to Saint con more times before

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,640
actually I framed that question weirdly

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,940
right who's been three or more times

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,940
who has ever listened to me speak before

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,379
apart from the guy that works for me

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,220
who else did you put your hand up you're

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,480
listening do you know what I spoke on

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,800
last time

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,420
what was it

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,699
you can't remember perfect I made an

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,380
indelible impression

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,939
um so I'm starting to feel that I'm

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,220
Typecast because I'm obviously European

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
hence the accent I've worked on this my

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,899
entire life but more importantly every

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,880
time I come to sanecon I end up speaking

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,620
about privacy and it's the only

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,540
conference that I speak about privacy at

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,040
so I'm starting to feel like saying con

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,780
just rolls me out as the token European

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700
to talk about data privacy

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,260
um I cannot promise that this is going

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,660
to be informative it might be mildly

25
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,219
entertaining it might be mildly

26
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,260
controversial I don't apologize at all

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,899
my opinions are my own on all things if

28
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,100
you want to challenge an argue with me

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,899
you are welcome to but I'd rather leave

30
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,579
you something to think about then just

31
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,660
tell you some facts they run on some

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,140
slides I did also bring some chocolate

33
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,580
so I will ask some questions and this

34
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,840
came straight from England yesterday

35
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
literally yesterday I landed on a plane

36
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,740
last night about 11 p.m

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,180
um so I will ask some questions and

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,860
audience participation is encouraged in

39
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,080
fact I'll start it not mandatory but can

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,920
people stand up

41
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,700
cool you can good I'm glad

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
stay standing

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,720
if you think they're data privacy is

44
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,920
actually a thing that this actually

45
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
matters feel free to sit down there's no

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,939
offense taken from me

47
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,380
interesting a lot less people sat down

48
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,939
the last time I did this three years ago

49
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,619
um stay standing if you think it's more

50
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,420
of a thing in Europe than it is in the

51
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,460
US

52
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,439
okay stay standing if you think that's

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,640
changing

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,020
stay standing if you think that the US

55
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,180
now cares more about privacy than it did

56
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,159
five years ago

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,020
just more more than five years ago

58
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,880
interesting again there's a lot more

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,079
standing I asked the same questions was

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
a lot more sounding stay standing if you

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
think it cares more about prison it is

62
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,220
three years ago

63
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,500
okay so continue straight what about one

64
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,258
year who thinks it's changed more in the

65
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,660
last year

66
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,680
there's a few Still Standing

67
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,780
um

68
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,280
why why do you think it's changed more

69
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,319
okay anyone who thinks that privacy has

70
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,400
changed in the US and wants to answer

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
why they think it's changed or what's

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,200
changed

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,640
okay the UPR said the Privacy Rights Act

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,379
being one and then there's no one coming

75
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,879
in California it's also fairly large so

76
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,860
probably forming more of a kind of

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,680
federal everyone can sit down by the way

78
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,239
so there's at least a perception that

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,700
things are changing okay good anyone

80
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,099
know how big the biggest gdpr fine

81
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,200
issued was or any number that's up there

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,980
anyone know any of them

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,080
too much let's go down a long way

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,540
uh it's part of Facebook's five billion

85
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,220
fine but the five billion fine in total

86
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,379
wasn't all purely gdpr or privacy rights

87
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,459
based but we're getting to the right

88
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,420
angle anyone else has more guesses

89
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,280
one billion we're pretty close the

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,420
largest pure gdpr fine is 775 million

91
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,420
euros lodged at Amazon

92
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,420
yeah sorry sorry dollars Euros GBP sorry

93
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,819
okay I apologize for my Look it's even

94
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,080
harder being a Brit okay well I've got

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,159
three currencies in my head at least

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,360
you've only got two

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,019
um

98
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,760
and to go one step further does anyone

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,018
know how much Amazon paid

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,819
no idea no one has a clue anyone know

101
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,280
how much that anyone has paid for a gdpr

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,900
fine that was issued does anyone know

103
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,780
the answer to any of those questions

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,459
oh there's a handle

105
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,739
money someone has paid money

106
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,340
um yeah we actually have no idea there

107
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,580
is no single privacy fine which has been

108
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,640
closed and paid officially and has been

109
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,620
documented publicized they have all been

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,840
settled out of court so my point which

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,459
is meant to be slightly

112
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,659
I suppose invasive in its opinion of

113
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,639
will the US ever really care I'm not

114
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,620
sure that the world actually really

115
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,740
cares we make a gesture to care but I'm

116
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,600
not sure that we actually really do I

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
probably should introduce myself at some

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,479
point my name is I'm the VP of security

119
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,340
and compliance at wistic which is coming

120
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,840
down the road in Pleasant Grove

121
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
um in the vendor risk management space

122
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,199
prior to that I've worked in Silicon

123
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,000
Valley for the best part of a decade and

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,979
prior to that I did a hell of a lot of

125
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,360
different forms of pen testing as a

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,100
consultant physical pen testing social

127
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,900
engineering and everything else in

128
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
between including a lot of lock picking

129
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,020
which is a lot of fun and why do I have

130
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,240
a right to actually speak on privacy

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
well I've done it twice to two different

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
companies and made them full GPR

133
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,380
compliant and we're on the way to our

134
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,220
third

135
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,199
I was responsible for everything

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
privileged on the west coast which

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,840
covers most of the major privacy

138
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
engagements in America for a couple of

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,479
years

140
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,860
um I've dealt with major breach

141
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,780
responses and airline in the Middle East

142
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,460
we lived in Jordan funny story actually

143
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,080
and you'll learn that I have some random

144
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,000
stories in life I was on the phone once

145
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
I used to have a couple of NCC group and

146
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,540
unheard of NCC group

147
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,979
no there needs to be better Marketing in

148
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,360
this state clearly but they're a

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,919
consorting firm and I got a phone call

150
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,120
saying can you please go and do a

151
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,860
project in a man don't know where a man

152
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,060
is

153
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,680
Jordan yeah I gave it away in the first

154
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
bit right

155
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,020
um but I had no idea at the time so I

156
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,340
agreed and ended up with my family with

157
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,960
a baby daughter who at the time was

158
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,240
seven weeks old living in a hotel suite

159
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,139
in Jordan

160
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,699
um doing breach remediation for an

161
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,320
airline who would commit the Privacy

162
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
breach interesting story I got back and

163
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,100
two weeks later got a phone call and got

164
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
moved to here and California to work

165
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,539
with major companies in the Silicon

166
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,100
Valley Leviathan if you know what that

167
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,660
means we'll get to it later

168
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,880
I've also done gdpr work at Major

169
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,639
retailers banks that you've all heard of

170
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,380
I've got a ton of acronyms of which

171
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,639
those are just some of them which you

172
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,900
might care about will be really

173
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,580
interesting and I like to think that I

174
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,139
am not an idiot

175
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,199
um at least not entirely anyway

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,580
so there's some things we're going to

177
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,620
talk about today and again some of these

178
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,940
will make no sense hopefully they make

179
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,919
some sense as we go but I can't promise

180
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,479
they will make a lot of sense but they

181
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,340
might be interesting the questions we

182
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,660
always want to ask or at least I always

183
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,300
want to ask is what has changed

184
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
why has it changed will there ever be

185
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,460
federal or Global regulation in this

186
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,139
space will it ever exist and what

187
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,819
happens next so what am I going to talk

188
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,440
about I'm going to do history in Reverse

189
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,759
to start with to give us kind of

190
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,720
foundation about what we're talking

191
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,940
about I'm then going to talk about the

192
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,280
worry I have for my children's future

193
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,139
I'm going to talk about why covid-19 was

194
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,240
actually gdpr's Best Friend Bear with me

195
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,620
on that one when I said I might be

196
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,819
controversial these are the three slides

197
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,380
in a row which might offend various

198
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,580
people in the room

199
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,699
um covid-19 and gdpr then woke in social

200
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,020
justice and how it's changed the way

201
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,039
that we think

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
um and football or soccer whether they

203
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,940
are both the same thing or very

204
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,319
different and then the problem with

205
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,819
known unknowns and hopefully on the way

206
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,419
we will learn some things

207
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,080
I'm gonna start with a question on this

208
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,759
one

209
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,759
the interesting thing I think about a

210
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,960
kind of History

211
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,819
is this concept of whether we're going

212
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,639
to get to a global framework a stock 2

213
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,039
type 2 effectively for privacy right

214
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,240
um we've got an attempt in ISO 27 27 701

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,759
which no one really has and if you've

216
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,080
heard of I'll be impressed because most

217
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,880
people haven't so it's been very

218
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
effective in its marketing and I don't

219
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,180
think we'll ever get there because we

220
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,419
think differently as people right but I

221
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,860
think it's interesting to go backwards

222
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,300
and understand why this journey happened

223
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,520
and how we got to the point that we now

224
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,220
are because this is a topic that 10

225
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,580
years ago was completely nondescript no

226
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,039
one talked about data privacy pii was an

227
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,720
acronym that nobody knew

228
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,940
but 10 years on Suddenly It's a Hot

229
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,979
Topic in basically every government

230
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,680
globally and multinationals it's become

231
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,319
a marketing vehicle it's big business

232
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,000
I think it's important to understand why

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,580
and so if we look now at the fact that I

234
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,479
don't think there'll ever be Global

235
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,620
provincial regulation in fact I'll ask

236
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,699
does they don't think they will be they

237
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,080
don't ever think this will be a global

238
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,400
thing that we will have to do there'll

239
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
be a an international law and how you

240
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,780
deal with personal data

241
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,479
anybody no America is never the audience

242
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,740
to ask that question too oh there is one

243
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,479
in the back look at that brave you could

244
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,340
have a chocolate just for being privacy

245
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,840
focused come and get it when you want

246
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,120
now or later on come and choose a bar

247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
um but I'm interested right so if we go

248
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
but cpra is about to launch cpra is very

249
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,379
similar to the upra but it's more

250
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,660
important they're both built off of gdpr

251
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,039
and as much as they consider data

252
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,020
privacy rights as individuals and how

253
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,820
our data is protected shared sold

254
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,799
exchanged all that kind of stuff the

255
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,599
reason cpra matters more than one in

256
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,219
your state no offense is because there

257
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,080
is so many more people in California and

258
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,399
because Silicon Valley is in California

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,140
and therefore most of the companies

260
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,940
actually deal with personal data on a

261
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,820
daily basis in ginormous volumes are all

262
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,380
based there that's going to have an

263
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,000
impact but whether it will be enforced

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,640
or not good question uh CCPA had a lot

265
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,720
of fines anyone know how many people

266
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,540
have actually paid their CCPA fines

267
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,980
now you see you're starting to

268
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,940
understand

269
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
um what's interesting as well is why

270
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,019
this stuff matters 10 years on

271
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,060
data doesn't double don't listen to the

272
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,740
TED Talks it's all complete nonsense

273
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,800
data increases on average by about 20 to

274
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,899
30 percent a year so we'll know what

275
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,160
we're now measuring data in

276
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,260
I I heard it zettabytes is the one

277
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,820
zettabytes which goes from exabytes

278
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,620
which goes from petabytes now zettabytes

279
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,700
is interesting because I always think

280
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,899
that you want to visualize things I'm a

281
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,779
visual learner and a Zeta a Zeta by

282
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,279
effectively means that you have to have

283
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,240
500 quadrillion sheets of A4 paper

284
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
now again to kind of bring that back

285
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,899
into a visual lesson the Burj Khalifa is

286
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:40,920
the world's tallest building my son

287
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,660
desperate wants to go to it and you'd

288
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,320
have to fill three of those and some

289
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,180
to consume the world's data at this

290
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,420
point in time right it's a lot of paper

291
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,360
how much of it is on you

292
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
does anyone want to guess like does

293
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,720
anyone know like we don't right we have

294
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
no idea how much data about us floats

295
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,300
around or one Earth that data is or what

296
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
someone might do with it or why someone

297
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,839
might want it like it's scary

298
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,180
you go back from the relevance of cpra

299
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,740
and you get into privacy Shield being

300
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,019
thrown away previous year was was

301
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,300
scrapped thanks to a guy called Max Rems

302
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,980
um who decided that basically all kinds

303
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,480
of things happen in Europe predominantly

304
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,580
again let's go Silicon Valley uh main

305
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,140
target was meta who were transferring

306
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,640
information from the Republic of Ireland

307
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,140
which by the way if you don't know why

308
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,040
all the tech companies have their

309
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
offices in the Republic of Ireland it's

310
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
because it's a tax Haven and they were

311
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
transferring all the data back across

312
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,339
the US without any form of Legally

313
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,680
binding agreements consent or technical

314
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,899
controls in place and lots of that data

315
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,660
was accessed maliciously or or caught

316
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,279
maliciously and so the Privacy Shield

317
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,080
which if anyone's ever done privacy of

318
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,940
your company has anyone done a privacy

319
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,440
shield for their company

320
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,660
do you think it has any value no it's

321
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,000
nonsense right why is it nonsense

322
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
why

323
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,100
exactly right and the questions

324
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,480
effectively like do you have like are

325
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,160
you able to tie your shoelaces like they

326
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,779
are literally ridiculous so privacy

327
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,760
Shield was scrapped the irony of this is

328
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
you know what's happening next year

329
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,720
no privacy Shields coming back

330
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,579
so previous year was scrapped because it

331
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,579
made no sense and the EU in the US got

332
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,480
back together and said we need to find

333
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,800
some kind of solution because right now

334
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,480
it's really complicated if you deal with

335
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,519
privacy or company or international data

336
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,260
transfers you'll learn the only people

337
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,320
making money are lawyers because there

338
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
is a hell of a lot of legal work

339
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
involved in this so basically they got

340
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,240
together and said let's try nothing else

341
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,740
and their concept is let's go back to

342
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,720
previously Shield 2.0 which again

343
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,459
because it went through the courts here

344
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,019
and because people can't agree will be

345
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,820
self attestation and the questions will

346
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,380
be fairly similar so I give it about two

347
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,120
years before I get scrapped again but we

348
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,380
will have a period of time when there'll

349
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,540
be something else we can do CCPA was

350
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,339
probably the first part of disruptive

351
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,980
privacy regulation in the US

352
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,940
predominantly and almost entirely folks

353
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,279
on the sale of personal data and it was

354
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,040
at least in gesture aimed at trying to

355
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,260
limit what Silicon Valley Leviathan was

356
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,760
trying to do by which I mean kind of the

357
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,519
likes of meta Google Apple wherever else

358
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,860
kind of want to bundle into that group

359
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,959
uh again it's pretty weak in its

360
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,579
enforcement and if you actually read it

361
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,320
you'll learn it's very very be great

362
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,579
it's very hard to work out who it

363
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,720
applies to when it applies or what it

364
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,620
actually means

365
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,779
previous to that the first and only time

366
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,640
I think apart from other instance where

367
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,800
something that happened mattered is gdpr

368
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
gdpr is big like it is hard

369
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
um I remember doing it back when it

370
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
actually first got launched and doing

371
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,899
the implementation programs in 2017.

372
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,880
there is so much work behind that and

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,019
we'll get into some of it right at the

374
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,820
end but that that made companies

375
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,740
actually act and it wasn't really

376
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,300
because you were kind of afraid of

377
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,320
getting fined it was because people

378
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,120
wouldn't do business with you like you

379
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,260
literally couldn't get a company to put

380
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,220
on their vendor list if you couldn't

381
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,300
evidence that you've done some kind of

382
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,940
gdpr compliance so it became quite

383
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,040
important and relevant so that was

384
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,600
interesting before that was privacy

385
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
Shield which was the Forum gdpr doesn't

386
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
matter now because we sacked it off and

387
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
before that is the DPA does anyone know

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,220
what that stands for or where it's from

389
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,380
you're very close it's

390
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,600
not not quite as close but equally

391
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,459
someone close

392
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,680
it's the data protection act I don't

393
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,260
know where it's from

394
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,399
I'll give you another bar of chocolate

395
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,139
we've already lost one I'm offering

396
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,279
chocolates out for any corn with any

397
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,720
knowledge I'm gonna eat them all if not

398
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,040
don't worry I shall take him to work and

399
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
let him anyway the daily protects that

400
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,980
came from the UK yes we are the people

401
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,360
that care and started this whole

402
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,240
movement I apologize profusely but we

403
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,639
started it in 1998 about 10 years after

404
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,260
computers went mainstream yes you can

405
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,240
argue with me on that date but most

406
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,740
people generally accept that that's kind

407
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,240
of the point of time where it came and

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,320
it was

409
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,820
I suppose in reaction to understanding

410
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,959
suddenly there was a lot of data around

411
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,639
both electronically and both not

412
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,899
electronically and we should do

413
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,160
something to control it now what's

414
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,420
fascinating is 1998 to 2018

415
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,279
that's a long time

416
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,040
that's 20 years that this whole Space

417
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,560
went entirely unchecked think about what

418
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
happened in then like think about the

419
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,720
fact that there was no 3G 4G no social

420
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,940
media no mobile phones in the modern

421
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,459
smartphone world no GPS available train

422
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,779
outside the military like think about

423
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,100
all the things that happened in that

424
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,500
time period and it took that long before

425
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,820
somebody did something you had a handle

426
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,680
yeah there's lots of things I could have

427
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,300
put in there

428
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,959
but where's

429
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
yeah I think that the point here is to

430
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,980
stick to kind of generic ones that cover

431
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,120
all kinds of things rather than focusing

432
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
specifically because UK and Europe has

433
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,000
their own specific parts of electronic

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
and well marketing e-privacy regulations

435
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,500
and electronic e-privacity regulations

436
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,300
all that relate specifically to Children

437
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
um and the age of consent which varies

438
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,639
and changes around but yeah I agree

439
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,420
there are other things that we could

440
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,860
have covered in there but my slide would

441
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,779
have got too busy so I'm sorry forgive

442
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:52,740
it

443
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,500
um these two pictures

444
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,260
are my kids the little boys Oliver and

445
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,639
the little girl is Isabelle now the

446
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,699
reason these are poignant is what

447
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,180
happened in 2018

448
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,339
anyone remember what's on the last slide

449
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,380
gdpr great thank you so I took this

450
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,420
picture to talk about the relevance of

451
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,079
gdpr in kids at the time that it came to

452
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,660
peace to place and that one was taken on

453
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,100
Monday night anyone know where The Shard

454
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,959
is or what The Shard is

455
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,519
yeah

456
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,139
what is it

457
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,459
oh you can come and get a bottle of

458
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,360
chocolate there that's impressive

459
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,620
knowledge

460
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,899
is it it's the tallest building in

461
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,940
Europe too I think currently um and for

462
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,959
some reason my kids want to have dinner

463
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,040
at the top of the show I don't know why

464
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,060
they're strange children but anyway

465
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,820
that's a separate side note so why do I

466
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,339
have a worry for my children's future

467
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,519
this is why when gdpr came to force my

468
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,160
kids were four and zero

469
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,040
their data electronically was held in a

470
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,079
number of a number of places passports

471
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,760
uh passport to electronics they were

472
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,199
yours right they hold data around you

473
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,060
that's the point Biometrics

474
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,440
um they had birth certificates I don't

475
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,820
know how that works in the US but ours

476
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,959
are held electronically and they're held

477
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,579
centrally by the government by a branch

478
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,860
of the government uh we fly a lot both

479
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,320
holidays and for work

480
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,300
um and that meant Airlines predominantly

481
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,339
Delta had a lot of my data and my

482
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,079
children's data the stuff about how how

483
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,339
old they are what they like to eat that

484
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,660
kind of thing we spend a lot of time in

485
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,940
hotels put on the IHG so they know about

486
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,680
my kids their age their preferences

487
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,959
their requirements and vitality is a

488
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,639
health insurance company which covers

489
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,019
them for the illnesses they have and

490
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,699
both my kids have announced of some form

491
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,380
and therefore have a long-standing kind

492
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,899
of record and back catalog now that's

493
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,079
interesting but most of those are fairly

494
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,579
trustworthy all right I actually got

495
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,899
hats no longer before anyone raises the

496
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,399
hand but um

497
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,540
they're predominantly government

498
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,660
agencies and yes if anyone else wants to

499
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,680
make that joke I'm aware that my

500
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
government is a bit of a mess we've had

501
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,959
three prime ministers in the space for

502
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,220
three months but that's a separate

503
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,019
conversation on the day

504
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,699
but in theory you should be able to

505
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,899
trust them more

506
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,100
now things have changed it's 2022 and my

507
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,139
kids are now older my son is eight and

508
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,839
my daughter is four so those parts of

509
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,220
their data will still exist but they'll

510
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,520
have other data as well and why and what

511
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,260
now

512
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,459
my children like everyone else's

513
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,359
children for some reason obsessed with

514
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,980
YouTube I don't know why I don't know

515
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,599
why they like watching people on unbox

516
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,520
toys or play with other people's toys it

517
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,500
seems a strange weird thing to me but

518
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,579
they do

519
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,900
um I only let them on YouTube kids and I

520
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,819
know I can see them but still even with

521
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,380
those limitations YouTube knows what

522
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,880
they like right he knows what they watch

523
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,280
it's predictive that's how it works and

524
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,419
what's interesting about that is it's

525
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,240
also public so if people want to try and

526
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,340
exploit my kids and insert videos or

527
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,960
stuff I don't want to see then they know

528
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,340
the types of things that my kids would

529
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,960
like and they're not abnormal they're

530
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,100
fairly standard children so they know

531
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,480
what kind of things kids of those ages

532
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,039
would like right first thing it makes me

533
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,620
slightly nervous second Alexa we can

534
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
argue long into the night about whether

535
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,860
Alexa listens to you or not

536
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,660
um and whether or not it has data from

537
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,460
what you said separate conversation

538
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,620
again but I have several in my home and

539
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,660
my kids interact with them a lot they

540
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,919
ask them the football scores my son's

541
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,020
obsessed with football or soccer my

542
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,760
daughter gets to tell jokes or tell

543
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,740
stories or to play songs right so they

544
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,419
know again the things that my children

545
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,520
like the things that they react to they

546
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,020
know their voice in theory that's been

547
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,400
recorded right

548
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,820
Instagram now I was talking upstairs to

549
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,840
some people earlier this morning about

550
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,580
the fact that I've educated my wife in

551
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,780
the fact that Instagram should be a

552
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,679
private account

553
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,120
she's not a blogger she's just a normal

554
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,360
Sharer but then she has thousands of

555
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,160
friends

556
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
which I once investigate and said why do

557
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,039
you have thousands of followers because

558
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,240
she said well I just approve anyone who

559
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,140
asks to follow me

560
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,039
supporting your account being private at

561
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,720
that point right so I don't know who can

562
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,980
see the pictures of my children neither

563
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,419
she has no idea what half of these

564
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,500
people are

565
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,240
um so that's that's a scary Point Amazon

566
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
is the one that makes me most slightly

567
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,740
nervous my kids spend a lot of time on

568
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,840
Amazon looking for various toys they

569
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,100
want to buy and adding into wish list

570
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,360
and shopping baskets and various other

571
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
things and that means that it predicts

572
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,539
what it thinks I want to buy and while

573
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm not an avid fan of Paw Patrol I get

574
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,919
offered a lot of Paw Patrol deals

575
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,280
right and that means that Amazon Knows a

576
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,020
Lot Like again they know everything that

577
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,700
my kids think and like

578
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,620
that scares me and the one that really

579
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,080
terrifies me Apple you know what's

580
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,360
really interesting I love this ever you

581
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,380
might I don't think this is a us thing

582
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,000
which is European thing Apple played an

583
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
advert for a while where they started

584
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,700
talking about how you can turn off

585
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,740
tracking in all the apps and turn off

586
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,299
private and perfectly make your apps

587
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,220
private was that an advert here too

588
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,720
yeah right

589
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,400
interesting right because you can

590
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,440
control every app that's on your phone

591
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,980
they don't let you turn apples off

592
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,720
I think I'll have a second you can turn

593
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,820
off any app on your phone apart from

594
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,419
Apple they know everything about you

595
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,059
like they know everywhere I go they know

596
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,320
when my kids are using my phone because

597
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,640
of the app that they're accessing they

598
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,299
literally know everything that I think

599
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,820
that's terrifying like I think about the

600
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,500
next four years on if I took these same

601
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,580
pictures again my son will be 12.

602
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,080
I'm open enough to say I don't know

603
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,940
where the metaverse is going

604
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,740
like but it makes me slightly nervous

605
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,539
thinking about my son in a in a VR world

606
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,120
having experiences and seeing things and

607
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,980
interacting with people that I can't see

608
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,780
or control because even like when I'm

609
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,919
sitting every shoulder with an iPad that

610
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,480
doesn't work if I'm not actually in the

611
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,299
space with him that scares me and I

612
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,919
think also when we go deeper than that

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,720
if we think about we all laugh at like

614
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,280
our grandparents who like you've

615
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,360
probably been there I've FaceTime with

616
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,919
my nan all the time and she'll try and

617
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,299
talk to the kids and she'll use the like

618
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,799
the FaceTime filters and before you know

619
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,000
it she stuck as a unicorn and those

620
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
rainbows come out the mouth and she

621
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,179
can't work hard to turn off right or the

622
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,380
fact that they're trying to write on

623
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,640
Facebook and she ends up sharing like

624
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,780
some picture of her shoes because she

625
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,620
was trying to take a picture of what was

626
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,580
in front of her but she moved the camera

627
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,440
too fast right and we laugh about that

628
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,100
but we are so similar like we're so

629
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,960
naive to the amount of data that we

630
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,820
share and the impact that it has on the

631
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,320
world around us the impact it has on our

632
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,539
lives like we don't think and we let our

633
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,160
kids do the same stuff and it terrifies

634
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,100
me and it should terrify you

635
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
moving on this is where I might get

636
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,280
slightly controversial so I apologize

637
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,320
but I don't apologize too much

638
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,940
um

639
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,200
since I think I've already got two

640
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,100
people who can get some chocolate let's

641
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,559
have another one of those why why you

642
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,900
need to decide why is gdpr been helped

643
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,000
by covid-19 why am I making this

644
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,299
statement

645
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,980
anybody has a guess

646
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,940
there's no wrong answers

647
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,360
I'll take that you can have one you can

648
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,440
come and get one as well I've lost track

649
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,580
of foods without chocolate so one of you

650
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,139
can come again the end yeah at the back

651
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,600
that's really interesting I've not

652
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,799
covered that at all on this but I want

653
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,820
to go to that that's really interesting

654
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,919
so your point is effectively that

655
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,260
because people's human interaction was

656
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,419
limited they spent more time in online

657
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,340
experiences trying to seek social

658
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,020
interaction or social involvement which

659
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,400
meant they're exposing more of their own

660
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,220
lives in a non-normal way

661
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,020
that's a really good point um I hadn't

662
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,220
thought about that so um yeah you should

663
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,179
come get the chocolate as well that's

664
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,080
really clever

665
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
um but yeah you're entirely right yeah

666
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,659
so and that Point's very valid too gdpr

667
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,059
was held because we became cognizant of

668
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,820
data like it's weird you're not talking

669
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,840
about some of the points about why it's

670
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
weird but it took a global pandemic to

671
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,659
make us think now most of us said I

672
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,580
don't really care if the government has

673
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,559
my data or most of us in Europe did the

674
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,059
US was a very different situation

675
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,260
um but most of us didn't really care we

676
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,059
said he's not it's my health it's my

677
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,299
family's health it's my friend's health

678
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,000
go ahead and take it but we were only

679
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,799
okay for so long

680
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,360
and then we weren't

681
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,580
um and I think what we saw is we saw

682
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,260
firstly the power of data and we saw

683
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,580
less democratic nations and we're

684
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,020
getting some of that who then saw how

685
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,760
they could use that data for control and

686
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,380
for Dominion

687
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,360
we saw what it might feel like to live

688
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,120
in Orwell's 1984. because suddenly

689
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,740
everyone knew everything about us and we

690
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,640
were forced to tell everyone everything

691
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,020
about us and that was kind of freaky

692
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,159
I've read that book a number of times

693
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,419
and I think it's now like an

694
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,559
understatement of what we actually live

695
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,080
in so it's interesting and we saw that

696
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,419
our governments our major businesses had

697
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,360
no concept of what basic human privacy

698
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,380
rights were

699
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,539
right in the U.S you often flight your

700
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,100
Amendment rights that's not an insult I

701
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,860
quite like it by the Americans but

702
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,360
what it really saw is the government had

703
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,980
no concept at all around individual

704
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,419
privacy rights they literally just came

705
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,980
from out the window

706
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,000
so

707
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,960
what are some of the things that

708
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,520
happened I I can sort of read that this

709
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
is a quote ready from a Deloitte report

710
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,220
and I think I don't usually put lots of

711
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,539
text on I found this one interesting it

712
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,159
says many of the protective measures

713
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
governments are taking in these areas

714
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
are well understood and supported by the

715
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,620
affected populations concerns are being

716
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,600
raised however about their intrusiveness

717
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,580
on personal privacy and the implications

718
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,380
for the future the future being the key

719
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,700
word will come to that government

720
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,559
officials and corporate privacy offers

721
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,820
who struggle with balancing protection

722
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,860
measures and privacy safeguards often

723
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,240
without clear guidance and Regulators

724
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,919
because no one had a clue at the top and

725
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,600
in the private sector corporate boards

726
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,919
and top management have tended not to

727
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,900
prioritize privacy aspects in the fight

728
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,460
against the virus I'd like to say that's

729
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,679
not purely incidental but that might be

730
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,059
my view against major multinational

731
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,620
corporations

732
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,140
some examples globally some will be

733
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,280
focused everywhere and some are quite

734
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,140
specific we started to share our

735
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,400
vaccination issue we were asked we're

736
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,480
right I'm still asked for at the airport

737
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,039
now I've still got an app and I show it

738
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,780
as like a digital certificate I don't

739
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,159
care about that I'm all right with that

740
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,039
that's fine medical history are you more

741
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,840
susceptible to Kobe should you be kept

742
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,580
indoors more this was a thing in the UK

743
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,559
certain people were told to stay indoors

744
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,820
when certain will have to go out based

745
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,140
on your susceptibility and that's

746
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,820
particularly relevant in a state

747
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,679
Healthcare System when we're paying for

748
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,179
you we don't want to increase the risk

749
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,559
of kind of strangling the system right

750
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,400
so that happened in a lot of countries

751
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,720
with State Healthcare

752
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,220
travel history

753
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,740
where have you been are you more likely

754
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,240
to bring covert 2 there or bring it back

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
from there should you quarantine who

756
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,240
should pay for your quarantine but these

757
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,260
became questions we have to share

758
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,600
contact history this happened in several

759
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,860
countries in the Far East and in the

760
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,820
Middle East

761
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,500
who are you speaking to they literally

762
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,539
have centrally owned telecommunications

763
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,520
Network and they can tell who you're

764
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,440
physically in contact with like have

765
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,940
your has your phone been the vicinity of

766
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,320
this person they had covered in the last

767
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,820
72 hours so why are you together you've

768
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,020
just breached a rule you're now getting

769
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,220
fined right they were doing that

770
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,299
genuinely

771
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,220
um your social media data people got

772
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,900
fined in the UK loads for Instagram

773
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,120
posts this was a big thing people would

774
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,500
take an Instagram post of them like

775
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,120
walking their dog with a friend having a

776
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,500
coffee and we had a role in the UK for

777
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,940
quite a while where you could only go

778
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,919
Outdoors for shopping and for exercise

779
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,720
twice a day and you couldn't see anyone

780
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,400
who's outside of your external like

781
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,260
major family Network basically so people

782
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,460
would post it on Instagram and the

783
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,600
police were genuinely tracking it people

784
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,679
were reporting to this like living in

785
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,000
Australia it was weird

786
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,620
um but people got reports and got fined

787
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,400
because they were caught on Instagram

788
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,200
having a coffee with a friend

789
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,320
your car data there was countries in the

790
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,299
world where the data and I won't name

791
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,799
any names but one of them just bought a

792
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,539
bird-based company this morning were

793
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,940
selling their data to National

794
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,100
governments who were tracking where they

795
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,320
were to see how far they'd gone if

796
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,000
they'd like left like the physical area

797
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
they're allowed to be in well they were

798
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,179
literally tracking the cars and then

799
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,620
live movements I know because the

800
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,120
company I used to work for did this for

801
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,159
two governments and they were genuinely

802
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,779
allowed with a state-owned

803
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,159
telecommunications Network to track

804
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,779
these physical movement like I kind of

805
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,460
find my phone type world of where people

806
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,500
went to see if they went too far from

807
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,820
their home or to see if they changed

808
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,200
country didn't tell people about it and

809
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,940
find a prostitute the answer

810
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,460
freaky right and I think two things came

811
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,720
out of this I think one of the Lessons

812
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,919
Learned for us and one of them is a

813
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,200
lesson learned for governments and for

814
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,140
kind of major multinationals for us

815
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,820
we became aware

816
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,059
that our data can do stuff

817
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,980
right it's strange the government asked

818
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,539
for your vaccine record or like your

819
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,880
your medication you're like no I'll give

820
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,980
you that I'm outraged but Facebook asks

821
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,480
you like 100 questions to decide if you

822
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
were more like Luke's Skywalker or more

823
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,779
like Harry Potter and you were happy to

824
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,760
answer every one of them

825
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,500
like go figure right

826
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,480
um we we seemed suddenly to be

827
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
uncomfortable with the data we were

828
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,580
being shared because it was being shared

829
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,080
with the government maybe or because

830
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,400
suddenly it was much more relevant as a

831
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,419
topic

832
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,919
we started to think that there was kind

833
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,960
of Big Brother uh we started to feel

834
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,880
slightly unnerved about what was

835
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,279
happening uh and it gave us kind of a

836
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
real insight into I suppose how much the

837
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,100
state can move it also made us angry but

838
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,299
then if you've been following the news

839
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,860
for the last three to five years lots of

840
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,360
things have made us angry as a

841
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,340
government and as a people so we'll move

842
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,740
on from that government-wise they saw

843
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,960
that data is power

844
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,659
I don't think governments

845
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,220
internationally have really seen that in

846
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,740
the way they did until covid they saw

847
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,760
value power control

848
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,919
they also saw that once you can get rid

849
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,179
of consent because you didn't need to

850
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:37,980
consent to this stuff most the time

851
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,779
very hard for you to try and get them to

852
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:40,919
reinstate it

853
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,299
they can now do what they want with your

854
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,380
data because you had to give them in the

855
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,059
first place and because it was a crisis

856
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,799
they didn't get much documentation on

857
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,820
what they were going to use it for they

858
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,100
just said solving the virus right who

859
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,840
knows what includes

860
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,659
it also I think

861
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,380
it gave him a kind of a reasoning that

862
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,120
it's very hard to do the thing that's

863
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,400
right for me as a politician or as a

864
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,779
government as an entity and for the

865
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,220
individuals that are there and I think

866
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,419
it left us with three questions it left

867
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,039
us with the questions of what are my

868
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,080
privacy rights and when is it right to

869
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
remove my rights when can you take them

870
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,620
what is okay what do we feel alright

871
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,980
about it it left me thinking once data

872
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,380
is required for one purpose

873
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,480
can we control and can we guarantee it's

874
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,860
not used for other things

875
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,380
because I happen to know that some of

876
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,760
that data that was acquired for tracking

877
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,620
people's covered movements is now used

878
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,299
for tracking criminals and that was Data

879
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,380
they weren't legally allowed access to

880
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,720
until covid-19 pandemic happened

881
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,340
interesting right

882
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,140
um and also should privacy ever be a

883
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,039
priority at all when you've got these

884
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,419
kind of issues

885
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,120
anyone read any of these books

886
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,679
any of them at all

887
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,240
come on

888
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,460
I am shocked one person you can come

889
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,539
have a talk about the end just for

890
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,740
having actually been well read in this

891
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,020
in this kind of verse uh I have spent a

892
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,919
long time in Silicon Valley and I

893
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,480
hope you don't offend people at this

894
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,659
point but um I have no real love for for

895
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,159
social justice or for the work movement

896
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,500
and these three books are all about that

897
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,020
and they're about one key Point

898
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,820
specifically you're gonna have to bear

899
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,120
with me for why this is relevant they

900
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,799
all talk about how what we call the

901
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,020
Silicon Valley Leviathan this group of a

902
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,299
small set of well not small but a small

903
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,340
set of very large tech companies affect

904
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,940
everything we think

905
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,260
howl through the use of fake news

906
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,000
dissemination or intelligent behavioral

907
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,260
algorithms they can force us down

908
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,000
Pathways they want us to whether that's

909
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,559
in electioneering or in behavioral

910
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,940
things because in the end if we're

911
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,320
scrapping on Facebook about whether or

912
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,659
not we think we should vote for Trump or

913
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,940
an anti-trump then we're spending more

914
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,500
time on the platform you know who makes

915
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,399
more money

916
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,899
Facebook because they get more money

917
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,820
from marketing right they want you there

918
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,940
arguing they want people to fight

919
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,100
what we also learned is that they can do

920
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,899
what we know as a different form of

921
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,580
search engine optimization this is an

922
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,659
interesting social experiment don't do

923
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,659
it now do it later but

924
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,220
they are predominantly left-wing and

925
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,419
Libra in their values I have no problem

926
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,500
with that but I do have a problem with

927
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,120
being told what right and wrong is if

928
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,740
you go on to Google later and Google

929
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,899
straight white couple you will find it

930
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,340
within the first line you will find

931
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,480
couples that are mixed race or

932
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,580
homosexual no problem with that but if

933
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,840
not with Google so why does it come back

934
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,899
if you Google black or mixed race gay

935
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,640
couple you won't see a straight white

936
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,620
couple at all in fact I went through

937
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,760
like the first 30 pages and still didn't

938
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,440
find one now again I'd have a problem

939
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,340
with the social views that have been

940
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,659
portrayed there but I do have a problem

941
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,440
with the fact that people have been

942
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,179
influenced into what they think

943
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,799
we're being told that our views aren't

944
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,320
right Google far right politics and you

945
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,059
will find lots of pictures of Hitler and

946
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,580
violence and anger and neo-nazis Google

947
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,679
far left politics and you'll find gay

948
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,600
pride movements and you'll find people

949
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,220
who are sitting in doing sitting

950
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,659
protests or people who are chained to

951
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,640
trees they look like they are good

952
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,620
positive cultural movements right we are

953
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,700
being controlled in the way that we

954
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,960
think

955
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,299
why is that relevant and these are my

956
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,120
opinions I think that one of the key

957
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,799
focuses of privacy was about being able

958
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,500
to control what people knew about us

959
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,260
so there is this concept that you can

960
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,940
control the data that's held on you you

961
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,700
can ask for it to be deleted you can ask

962
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,520
for it to be changed or amended

963
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,860
but you can't change what people think

964
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,380
about it

965
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,500
there has been a lot of politicians a

966
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,179
lot of celebrities a lot of influential

967
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,279
people are quite normal people

968
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,520
who for the views they held 10 15 years

969
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,740
ago have lost their jobs careers and

970
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,940
various other things

971
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,980
because their comments are taken either

972
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,140
out of context maybe in context but in a

973
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,399
different time we view things from a

974
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,480
different set of eyes now than we did

975
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,640
before or maybe they're complete

976
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,020
nonsense altogether which is also true

977
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,460
in some instances

978
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,919
now why I think that's interesting is

979
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,240
that one of the reasons I left social

980
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,260
media because I got worried about

981
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,279
everything I could possibly say that

982
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,600
could offend somebody and come back to

983
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,679
buy me in the boat at some point so I

984
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,640
thought let's just get out the platform

985
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,020
together

986
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,980
among other things

987
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,659
but what we don't realize is what we say

988
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,159
now

989
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,899
that's perfectly fine

990
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,299
might not be fine one day

991
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,460
now is that not my one of my rights to

992
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,659
privacy one of my fundamental rights

993
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,299
individual to have the right to I

994
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,760
suppose refute the right to defend in a

995
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,679
modern digital mob we don't have that

996
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,419
ability I'll give you one key example

997
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,520
which I think is really interesting

998
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,080
anyone seen the rise and fall of

999
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,779
Abercrombie and Fitch on Netflix

1000
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,240
someone said yes gosh I'm amazed someone

1001
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,260
said yes

1002
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,899
thank you usually no one ever says yes

1003
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,039
if I asked that question

1004
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,559
um but the reason this is important is

1005
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,360
that if you go to the mid

1006
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,000
to late noughties the real height or

1007
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,980
real ramping of social media

1008
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,419
Abercrombie and Fitch was about the

1009
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,559
coolest brand you could have in the US

1010
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,480
for a long time it represents a kind of

1011
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,980
preppy call masculine hunky America

1012
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,360
fast forward 10 years and what happened

1013
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,779
yeah it's fascinating right so go

1014
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,880
forward what was cool people wanted

1015
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,799
pictures in Abercrombie and Fitch

1016
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,240
because it was what was cool at the time

1017
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,039
go forward 10 years if people come back

1018
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,179
and if you had a slogan saying

1019
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,500
Abercrombie and fish is the coolest

1020
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,880
thing ever well you just associate

1021
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,059
yourself with xenophobism racism toxic

1022
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,519
masculinity

1023
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,840
chauvinism like everything you can

1024
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,960
possibly think of 10 years ago fine now

1025
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,260
no

1026
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,980
I always denote you on Instagram in the

1027
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,000
morning you take a picture of your

1028
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,559
coffee at this call in your hotspot on

1029
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,120
the new brunch Trend that's currently

1030
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,740
trending

1031
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,240
five years time that coffee company

1032
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
might be done for modern slavery that

1033
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,740
brunch menu item might now be considered

1034
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,120
to be completely offensive in the way

1035
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,500
it's like foie gras might be for all I

1036
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,220
know what's gonna happen and what's

1037
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,600
going to change and the restaurant you

1038
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,519
might be in might have now been done for

1039
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,260
selling out to a major mortgage National

1040
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,640
Corporation and selling their values in

1041
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,539
the way that's happened to a couple of

1042
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:55,500
companies who went to cocoa or

1043
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,179
McDonald's right so things can change

1044
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,100
frequently so my point here is that

1045
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,620
privacy there are written rights that

1046
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,500
are easy to put into place hard to

1047
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,059
enforce and always been fine properly

1048
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,219
but I think it runs deeper now I want to

1049
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,780
kind of be thought provocative here I

1050
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,800
want people to think about not just

1051
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,020
about the fact that the data that we

1052
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,239
share should be out of control

1053
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,739
think about the implications of what it

1054
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,940
could mean in the future and think about

1055
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,918
what we think about that as a society do

1056
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,060
we think it's right that people should

1057
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,199
be judged according to things that they

1058
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,300
said now or in the time that they said

1059
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,800
them because for me that's part of the

1060
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,639
daily privacy debate

1061
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,599
I don't know how many people watched the

1062
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,639
World Cup in 2018 the World Cup final

1063
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,500
yeah go ahead

1064
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,980
no

1065
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,739
250 million gosh you need a large

1066
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,879
education the importance of soccer

1067
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,359
globally

1068
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,560
a billion

1069
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,300
honestly this is the one the few times I

1070
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,500
said Americans do not understand the

1071
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,560
world outside of them 3.9 billion people

1072
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,740
watch the World Cup Final in 2018

1073
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,720
3.9 billion and that's registered

1074
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,119
devices so you could have had bars where

1075
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,160
there was like 100 people watching it so

1076
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,720
we're probably talking about at least

1077
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,400
two-thirds if not three quarters of the

1078
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,140
populace of this planet

1079
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,640
interesting

1080
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,440
why again am I talking about this it

1081
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,000
seems to be random and unimportant but

1082
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,960
it's because if I say football in the US

1083
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,339
what's the first body part you think of

1084
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,980
he's very hand right very helpful good

1085
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,880
placement

1086
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,619
um he's throwing hand right football to

1087
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,300
everyone else in the world

1088
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,859
foot

1089
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,320
there are facts that exist

1090
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,960
and the average NFL game the ball is

1091
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,260
kicked for somewhere between 20 and 39

1092
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,660
seconds of total kicking time actual

1093
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,460
moments that the ball is kicked right

1094
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,500
that's not very much

1095
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,760
especially when you include the adverts

1096
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,780
and you've got about four hours watching

1097
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,359
NFL game that's not very much

1098
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,280
anyone no borrow a chocolate line I've

1099
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
got a hamlet I've given out now anyone

1100
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,560
know when American football became

1101
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,060
American football I'll give you a clue

1102
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,599
it's important oh he's got Tana Brody

1103
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,060
no too early I'll give you a clue it's

1104
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,920
when the first time that forward passing

1105
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,640
was written to the rules

1106
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,240
close too far

1107
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,359
as the closest you're welcome takes on

1108
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,240
by the end it's 1905. 1905 was the year

1109
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,339
that the forward pass became a thing and

1110
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,020
the American Football started in the

1111
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,880
form that American football is before

1112
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,380
that point it was a combination of two

1113
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,180
games football obviously and something

1114
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,380
that's called rugby which used to be

1115
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,300
called Rugby Football which meant it was

1116
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,099
a combination predominantly of about 40

1117
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,140
kicking and the rest of throwing it then

1118
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,420
changed down to being less than 0.3

1119
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,980
percent of Kicking and the restaurant

1120
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,619
again why does this matter because if

1121
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,540
you ask any American what football is

1122
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,339
they will not point to a game that

1123
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,260
involves people kicking a ball they will

1124
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,220
point to again the involved people

1125
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,140
throwing a ball and that's because we as

1126
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,180
a society control rhetoric we control

1127
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,160
what things are defined as people can

1128
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,900
tell us what they want but in the end we

1129
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,579
decide what things are called because we

1130
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,680
call them those things so football will

1131
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,540
always be football here and football

1132
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,359
will always be football everywhere else

1133
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,300
why does that matter for gdpr because

1134
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,500
there's another thing that Americans

1135
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,940
don't like and you're probably not in

1136
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,380
agreement here you don't like being told

1137
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,460
by Europe what you should do

1138
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,680
and we've tried multiple times in this

1139
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,720
and it's now succeeding very well so

1140
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,220
what the general acceptance is if

1141
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,960
privacy is going to succeed in the US it

1142
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,480
has to happen in the U.S the same way

1143
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,859
that American Football was built and

1144
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,780
cultured here and not just taken from a

1145
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,220
different country that's how things work

1146
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,660
in America right love it on love it

1147
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,460
that's how their things are and what's

1148
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,140
interesting is it Federal Regulation in

1149
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,520
my opinion will never happen in the U.S

1150
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,740
why I'm an anti-lobbyist I make no

1151
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,060
apologies I don't think as long as

1152
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,140
marketing companies are paying the

1153
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,640
salaries of several congressmen or many

1154
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,200
many Congressmen there will be no

1155
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,660
federal privacy laws in America however

1156
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,400
state by state they'll try and make some

1157
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,619
kind of gesture movement more

1158
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:53,040
importantly what I'm seeing is a culture

1159
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
shift in US

1160
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,560
security massive culture shift genuinely

1161
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,000
I last lived and worked over here about

1162
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
three or four years ago before my

1163
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,579
current company and I hadn't been the us

1164
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,520
as much and back then no one gave a stop

1165
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,500
like nobody cared if I spoke up

1166
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,660
previously gdpr the question was how can

1167
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,099
I get around it because I want to sell

1168
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,440
in Europe how do I avoid this problem

1169
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,560
now I've got companies raising privacy

1170
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,020
curtains concerns to me as a whisket

1171
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,560
um

1172
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,320
they have no European non no non-us

1173
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,900
customers at all and they're like well

1174
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,980
we won't do the right thing like what's

1175
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,480
your standard list like do you think

1176
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,440
that's the right thing different privacy

1177
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,540
wise I did not expect that

1178
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,640
and that's changed because culturally

1179
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,560
we're Shifting the norm

1180
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,480
we as Security leaders and it's a

1181
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
security populous in the US are deciding

1182
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,099
what privacy is the things that we think

1183
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,599
matter not because governments or

1184
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,859
Regulators tell them because we think

1185
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,240
those things are relevant because we

1186
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,859
care about this or we care about that or

1187
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,240
we don't care about this it's like a

1188
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
smorgasbord and we're taking Parts on

1189
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,060
the buffet in the same way that American

1190
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,040
football came to be that is how we are

1191
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,900
doing things right we are driving change

1192
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,520
and every country needs to eventually

1193
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,740
adopt what fits and I think it will

1194
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,540
happen in the US I think the US already

1195
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,640
cares about privacy I think though it's

1196
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,440
happening in a Tech Community terminally

1197
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
a security community and it will

1198
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,020
overflow but it will take time together

1199
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,400
last couple of slides I'm aware that I'm

1200
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,200
well over time but no one's left yet or

1201
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,280
business but that's probably because

1202
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,140
I've just been marginally offensive

1203
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,599
um unashamed product placement I work

1204
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,800
for a couple of words in the vendor risk

1205
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,020
space why does this matter

1206
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,579
because

1207
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,460
Supply chains are big and complicated

1208
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,599
things

1209
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,320
right they just are I've now been in

1210
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,760
charge of security at several companies

1211
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,220
as a seesaw VC so and

1212
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,800
I've not owned a data center or data

1213
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,060
estate

1214
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,880
in six years seven years

1215
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,260
since then

1216
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,599
I've had nothing like no infrastructure

1217
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,960
at all everything is SAS from our infra

1218
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,220
to our products built to our testing

1219
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,359
environments to all the products we

1220
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,780
consume Everything Is Ours now

1221
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,400
the challenge here and I think I'm all

1222
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,420
right at this but I think most people

1223
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,780
probably aren't is do you know where

1224
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,940
data is moving between all of those

1225
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,260
vendors

1226
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,880
because I'd like to Hazard a guess that

1227
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,020
most people don't

1228
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,000
and you don't really know you might do

1229
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
vendor assessments but you don't really

1230
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,820
know where data is going right and it's

1231
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,800
interesting so over 50 of breaches

1232
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
happen in Supply chains that's not

1233
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,980
directly in supply chain companies but

1234
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,820
that's considering things like

1235
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,140
third-party Library components and

1236
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,760
products they are not yours you don't

1237
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,780
own them so if they get breached

1238
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,760
technically it's part of a supply chain

1239
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,180
37 year on year those are increasing

1240
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,300
and now 35 of companies as of this year

1241
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,800
have over a thousand vendors in their

1242
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,320
supply chain that number only a year ago

1243
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,980
one year ago was 20 percent

1244
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,260
so it's gone up by like nearly 100

1245
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,400
percent

1246
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,680
in a year that's how quickly this is

1247
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,440
going 91 of csos are spending more money

1248
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,520
on this stuff

1249
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,540
um they're trying to make things

1250
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,119
automated but 50 of csos and this is the

1251
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,619
most recent study what I contribute to

1252
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,540
and I was not about that 50

1253
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,720
um don't know what their risks are

1254
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,220
they don't know where they are that's

1255
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,079
slightly unnerving right what are the

1256
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,280
major is in our business

1257
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,780
no idea mate

1258
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,540
what I'm paying you for um so what what

1259
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,980
we do is we're sticking and why this is

1260
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
relevant and there are other competitors

1261
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,500
for us please don't take this as a pure

1262
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,180
you should buy whistling but um

1263
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,040
it's a way of looking in in transparency

1264
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,599
in Supply chains trying to understand

1265
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,160
what not just where the data is going

1266
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,839
but what are they doing with it why do

1267
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,460
they have it who are they giving you to

1268
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,599
who are the fourth bodies the fifth

1269
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,800
bodies the sixth parties the seven

1270
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,119
parties and I can tell you they're

1271
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,260
definitely going to double digits in

1272
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,640
several different environments in our

1273
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,839
estate at least

1274
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,460
and the opposite way around how many

1275
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,839
people here have had to complete a

1276
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,460
vendor assessment that's been given to

1277
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,839
them that they've had to then return to

1278
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,760
somebody

1279
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,900
yeah I don't believe there's only four

1280
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,099
or five hands more of you done that but

1281
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:38,940
you don't want your hands up at this

1282
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,960
point do you think I'm going to ask your

1283
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,420
question it's fine um we're trying to

1284
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,800
get away from that right we build on

1285
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,119
like things like profiles yeah I think

1286
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,500
you can pull this place this date in one

1287
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,940
place and pushes on and say we are being

1288
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,680
transparent you know what here's here's

1289
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,540
my stock 2 report mine's in there warts

1290
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,680
and all I've got my steps in their pen

1291
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,000
testing report all of them they're in

1292
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,320
there they're remediated but they're in

1293
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,040
there

1294
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,359
um well I'll tell you anything you want

1295
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,099
to know because I think that when we

1296
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,020
talk about privacy the same time we talk

1297
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,300
about security I am an advocate

1298
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,160
massively for transparency

1299
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,500
we should as a community be together we

1300
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,599
should talk about where data moves we

1301
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,859
should talk about why it's moving there

1302
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,000
we should talk about what we're doing to

1303
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,980
secure those movements we should talk

1304
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,859
about our posture what are our struggles

1305
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,900
right now what's hard what are we doing

1306
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,280
to solve it

1307
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,540
what are other people doing to solve it

1308
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,460
we should learn like we should build and

1309
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,420
that's what we're sticking is about we

1310
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,440
want to build an ecosystem where

1311
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
everyone can see each other's security

1312
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,500
postures their documentations who they

1313
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,940
use for pen testing what they pen tested

1314
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,619
what they found what they didn't and we

1315
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,940
can learn and collaborate together to

1316
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,740
make the world and the security world a

1317
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,079
better and more secure place and that in

1318
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:39,359
turn means that personal data by nature

1319
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,160
of that effort will be better protected

1320
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,599
because right now we don't know where it

1321
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,160
is we've done all the rest so

1322
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,440
to give you something remotely useful to

1323
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,420
go away with five key points that if you

1324
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,800
do want to try and improve the data

1325
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,420
privacy posture of a business are

1326
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,099
firstly there's no real surprise

1327
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,099
understand your data there's a thing

1328
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,140
called a data asset inventory and data

1329
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,520
flow mapping if you know any gdpr

1330
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,980
acronyms and what those are effectively

1331
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,780
is as a map that says this is all the

1332
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,859
elements of personal data very

1333
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,500
granularly name address whatever right

1334
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,240
or it's sexual orientation gender

1335
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,440
political opinions all the different

1336
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,079
types where it goes how it gets there

1337
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,180
like what's that is that an API call is

1338
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,740
it secure does it not um is it being

1339
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,180
dropped into sft being picked up like in

1340
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,339
an Excel spreadsheet how's it moving

1341
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,260
doesn't warm number two

1342
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,520
consent

1343
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,260
I cannot like I've been a lot of

1344
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,260
businesses they've been in

1345
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,640
hot water when I've got there around

1346
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,980
this kind of issue consent get consent

1347
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,000
and understand what you've got consent

1348
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,560
for and use it

1349
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,119
and I'd say do that now even when there

1350
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,500
isn't proper light even if you don't

1351
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,579
think previous is relevant thing because

1352
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:39,540
it's going to come at some point it's

1353
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,380
going to bite you in the butt if you've

1354
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,640
got a database somewhere in your company

1355
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,680
that marketing's holding of like 100 000

1356
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,839
users that you bought from somebody

1357
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,579
um might be okay now probably in a year

1358
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,740
or two assess your supply chain yeah I'm

1359
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,819
kind of pitching my product and I'm not

1360
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:51,720
going to pretend I'm not pitching my

1361
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,579
product I want to increase our AR number

1362
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,099
reality uh but at the same time it's

1363
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,300
really important to understand the risk

1364
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,440
in your supply chain to make sure you do

1365
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,960
enough to secure and protect it be

1366
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,660
transparent like tell people in privacy

1367
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,700
policy and documentation why you do what

1368
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,099
you do and what you do who you share it

1369
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,440
with why you share it what they can do

1370
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,819
if they want to know more

1371
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,260
and then make sure that you have a

1372
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,060
holistic and mature security posture

1373
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,880
having sock 2 type 2 and ISO 27001 does

1374
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,859
not mean you have a mature security

1375
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,319
posture

1376
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,000
means that you know how to play the

1377
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,980
auditor game having a mature security

1378
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,180
posture means that you actually take

1379
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,859
these things seriously and do proper

1380
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:31,380
work like that you actually build secure

1381
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,819
systems in a secure way that your

1382
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,079
engineers care about security

1383
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,579
that has been remotely useful mod

1384
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,200
entertaining and somewhat interesting if

1385
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,520
you have any questions on anything you

1386
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,680
can reach them by email if not I'm happy

1387
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,380
to take any q a people might have

1388
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,760
if not I'll shut up and go away

1389
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,359
cool I'll show them go away
