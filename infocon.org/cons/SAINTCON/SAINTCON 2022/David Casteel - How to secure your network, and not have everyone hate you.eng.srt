1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
all right

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,480
anybody else not excited to get back to

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,520
reality on Monday does this kind of feel

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,639
like not reality yeah me too I'm lucky

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,260
enough that I get to

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,840
basically ignore my work life for a few

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,780
days so not everybody is so

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,240
thankfully I have a amazing boss that

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,439
lets me do that so all right so

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,760
um

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,980
let's get started uh I I I've noticed uh

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,800
in my technical days that a lot of

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,700
people

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,079
um

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,840
don't have really the don't have any

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,460
background in sales like I did and I've

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,780
done I did an alarm sales for a couple

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,780
years for ADT and I learned a lot of

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,579
things about humans and interacting with

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,100
them and getting them to trust you

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,480
um if they trust you they'll buy stuff

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,000
from you it's kind of sad and good at

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,260
the same time if you have honest

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,420
intentions

25
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,980
but I think that's helped me a lot in my

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,699
I.T career dealing with

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,640
uh Executives and bosses and owners of

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,860
companies whether I've done some I.T

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,500
Consulting in the past I noticed a lot

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,080
of my I.T Consulting co-workers had

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,260
issues getting people to

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,340
secure their networks and because they

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,020
didn't know how to talk to people about

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,400
it so

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,380
um that's mostly what this Talk's gonna

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,720
be about as well as a little bit of my

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,240
experience implementing specific things

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,159
that are kind of some basic CIS controls

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
kind of thing if you haven't looked at

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,100
that document

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,799
uh you probably should so here's a

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,540
little bit about me

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,479
um my wife and I moved to Utah in 2008

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,420
so I guess a little over 10 years now

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,200
um

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,659
I have way too many hobbies and most of

47
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,240
them are expensive so can I kind of pick

48
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,979
one unfortunately and I don't that's

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,960
tough to do sometimes

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,939
um

51
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,860
I love photography I just got to go to

52
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,960
Yellowstone a couple weeks ago if you

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,420
haven't been it's amazing it's worth it

54
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,040
it's expensive

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
but it's worth it

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,820
um I've been in tech for over 20 years

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,818
off and on different roles

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,280
uh troubleshooting internet tech support

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,099
everything you can think of

60
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,060
um

61
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,459
I've been a sysadmin technically I guess

62
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,200
that's I guess that's kind of the role

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,239
that most people would notice it as it's

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,040
kind of all the Jack of all trades if

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
you work at a smaller company you know

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
what I mean you get to be you know

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,620
security engineer and you get to be

68
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,200
network engineer you get to be you know

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,379
Microsoft Office 365 engineer AWS

70
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,739
everything so it's you get to learn a

71
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,280
lot but it's it's exhausting sometimes

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,300
um

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,319
uh I'm a big uh proponent of privacy and

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,260
the eff as I'm assuming most people in

75
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,819
this room would be I would I would

76
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,680
expect that's been my experience anyways

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,260
so I I love supporting them I love

78
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,019
supporting uh privacy organizations and

79
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,019
companies like protonmail and and other

80
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,300
and others so

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,640
um another big love of mine and my

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
wife's more probably more my wipes than

83
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,680
mine but is fostering animals and if

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,840
anybody likes cute kittens I guess

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,819
you're in luck here oh sorry I forgot to

86
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,040
put this first so another love of mine

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
is helping people

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
um I found Operation Safe escape a few

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
years ago

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
um there's a great group group of people

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,560
that love helping people and victims in

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,620
need a lot of people get

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,140
entangle their devices when they're in a

94
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,480
relationship whether that's you know

95
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,580
actually married or not and they've been

96
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,459
living together as many of you know if

97
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,379
you have somebody's Apple ID or access

98
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,360
to their phone you can pretty much track

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,159
them anywhere they go as well as see

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,680
their text messages and everything

101
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,239
um if you're in an abusive relationship

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,760
that becomes a problem really fast

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,799
and a lot of people don't know where to

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,459
go

105
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,060
um

106
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,340
I've helped quite a few victims just

107
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,200
basic stuff you don't need to be some

108
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
Elite hacker and know Kali Linux and

109
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
stuff to help these people you just need

110
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
to know where the settings are at in say

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,940
an Apple ID to set up two-factor

112
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,099
authentication and basically kick all

113
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,200
the devices off there I mean it's simple

114
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
stuff like that that these people need

115
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,140
help with so if you do have some extra

116
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,199
time and you're looking for to volunteer

117
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,940
they're a great organization and I

118
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,279
absolutely love working with them

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,720
they're also for those interested

120
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
they're also working on it I don't have

121
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
a ton of details on it yet it's kind of

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,660
new they're working with a couple

123
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,160
different organizations including some

124
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,919
federal law enforcement on child sexual

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,780
abuse material and hunting those people

126
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,780
down there they've got some people that

127
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,080
have had experience with that before and

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,580
um like I said they're they've got some

129
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,080
great relationships with some law

130
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,120
enforcement uh people I don't know if

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,979
it's FBI who exactly it was I think it

132
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,240
might be I can't remember like I said

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
it's been a while since they they talked

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
about it and they're still kind of

135
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,380
spinning it up but that's kind of an

136
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,639
active threat hunting kind of thing if

137
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,440
you're interested just in that I think

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,699
they're you know they're two different

139
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,740
kind of things even if you're not

140
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,419
interested in helping people secure

141
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,460
their accounts I think that I think a

142
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,419
lot of people here probably be

143
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,800
interested in that so I wanted to put it

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,560
out there which I'll reach out to I'm on

145
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,780
Twitter that's where I I end up finding

146
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,520
them so

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,780
um there's a great group of people there

148
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,960
that all all love helping people and

149
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,540

if you if you get attached it might

168
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,720
fostering might not be a job for you

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,039
because you'll end up with a house of

170
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,259
like 15 animals so all right

171
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,039
this is kind of what I'm going to go

172
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,099
over

173
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,620
getting leadership buy-in

174
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,440
soft skills like I spoke about sales

175
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,060
skills technically and you're you're

176
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,919
selling your company on why they need to

177
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
do this whether you're whether you're a

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
consultant or you're an employee of the

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,940
company

180
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,800
it's your job to make them understand

181
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,380
why they need it and I know

182
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,180
I would I would guess that just about

183
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,800
everybody in this room

184
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,600
struggles with getting people to spend

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
the proper amount of money on security I

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,699
mean that's every security conference I

187
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,259
go to that seems like it's underlying

188
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,360
you know theme is that we don't have

189
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,220
enough money

190
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,259
um I listen to the to the the ciso talk

191
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,000
the other day and that was that's the

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,620
reason cecils are leaving they get in

193
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,380
there and they want them to do this this

194
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,380
and this and this but this cost a

195
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,720
million dollars and you have 50 Grand

196
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,819
figure it out and they figure out it's

197
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,520
not very much fun and then you get

198
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,680
scapegoated when there's a breach

199
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,539
so

200
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,360
um along with that sales communication

201
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,620
uh finding a core test group of

202
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,400
employees of co-workers of friends even

203
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
they're your friends I've got I've got a

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,419
couple friends that that of users at my

205
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,360
company that if I need to test something

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,220
they're they're the guinea pigs because

207
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,840
they I know they're not going to get

208
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,780
really that mad at me if it goes wrong

209
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,360
um and then back to a couple basic uh

210
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,860
CIS tenants

211
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,199
um and securities inventory and Patch

212
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,780
management including system upgrades and

213
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,080
stuff too so

214
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,200
[Music]

215
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,720
all right as most of you know

216
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,340
if you don't have leadership buy-in

217
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,960
you're probably not going to get funding

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,460
and you're probably going to have a

219
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,900
rough time

220
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,759
I've experienced this you can do it

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,740
without it and you're not as successful

222
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,840
and it's a lot more frustrating but

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,639
sometimes that's what it takes sometimes

224
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,139
you have to do that especially at a

225
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,060
smaller company if you're a one-man shop

226
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,639
or two-man shop or whatever

227
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,620
um if you only got a couple people in

228
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,240
there it's going to be tough to to

229
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,720
justify 100 grand for cyber security

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,180
but

231
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,180
the reason you need this is you have to

232
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,960
have

233
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
policies in place and there has to be

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,919
consequences for breaking those policies

235
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,379
for your fellow co-workers or they're

236
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,819
not going to listen to you I've I've

237
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,099
dealt with this and I'm thankfully in a

238
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,020
place now where I'm getting more

239
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,440
leadership buy-in and it's it's a whole

240
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,839
lot easier it's almost I I would almost

241
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,580
bet you to say it's impossible to do it

242
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,700
do it well without it because if you

243
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,679
tell somebody they need to update their

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,060
computer

245
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,339
and they don't have to listen to you

246
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,560
what are you going to do I mean

247
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
granted you you can you can install

248
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,760
things that you can force them to update

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,260
and push it to update

250
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,839
but when that happens and you brick

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,339
their machine

252
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,220
and they run to the boss and say you

253
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,440
know and there and then that boss is not

254
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,180
on board with you doing that

255
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,440
you're going to have a you're gonna have

256
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,959
a bad time I thankfully have not had

257
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,200
that happen yet but I can imagine

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,740
and so and and I think I think a lot of

259
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,160
uh snow and Jason talked about too is

260
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
that you need to have policies in place

261
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
so those users know what you ex they're

262
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,940
expected to do if if they don't know who

263
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,620
to call or when there's a problem when

264
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,700
they get it when they click on a

265
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,560
phishing email or what they're supposed

266
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,440
to do that's on you like you need to

267
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,760
tell them what they need to do they need

268
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
these needs to be in writing it needs to

269
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
be communicated it needs to be easily

270
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,180
found and and not just in an email we

271
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,820
all know how often people read emails I

272
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,260
I don't know about if anybody else has

273
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,720
more success but I I don't seem to have

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
very much success getting people to read

275
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,540
and respond to emails very often

276
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,040
especially when you send them out to the

277
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
whole company so

278
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,420
um having that stuff in writing having a

279
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,800
place to refer back to obviously

280
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
training training and going over is

281
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,880
important but having a reference so they

282
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,459
can find it and you know if if you do

283
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,320
training and somebody clicks on a link

284
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,480
or gets a phone call in 18 months from

285
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,760
now are they gonna remember that stuff

286
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
probably not

287
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,760
if they have a place so that they can

288
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,500
refer back if they can pull up a web

289
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,839
page a Wiki anything like that and go

290
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,700
hey I remember that there's a the place

291
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,140
I can find this stuff that's what I'm

292
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,820
supposed to do and there's a number that

293
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,019
I'm going to call or there's an email

294
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,220
that I need to send it to whether you

295
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,019
need to set up a distribution group for

296
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,779
you and you know to send spam emails to

297
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,120
or a breach email if I think I

298
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,820
downloaded a virus whatever it is have a

299
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,140
place for these people to communicate to

300
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,200
and let them know you know re reiterate

301
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,820
it what they're supposed to do because

302
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,899
they're not gonna they're not gonna

303
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,100
remember especially when they're

304
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,660
stressed out when if they think they

305
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,339
clicked on the link they've infected

306
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,839
their computer or the network they're

307
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,300
stressed out

308
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,060
um so and the reason like I said the

309
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,200
reason I want to go over sales is

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,579
because you need to sell leadership on

311
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,380
this most of the time if they don't have

312
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,360
this if they haven't budgeted this and

313
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,620
they have and they don't have a budgeted

314
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,880
now

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,339
um and they haven't had a breach

316
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,680
they don't think they need it and so you

317
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,420
need to you need to convince them that

318
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,160
they do need it and that they need it

319
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,860
before they get a breach and not after

320
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,540
uh it's kind of like the old adage you

321
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,980
can't you know the horses are already

322
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,600
out of the barn if you already had a

323
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,920
breach now that's not the time to spend

324
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,420
money on cyber security

325
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,519
as we all know like I said I'm I'm

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,959
preaching the choir a little bit but

327
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,240
like I think I think more people need to

328
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,860
realize that

329
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,760
um

330
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,800
their bosses need to need to be

331
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,120
explained why they need to care about

332
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,339
this stuff you need to show them what

333
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,800
happens those numbers that that snow put

334
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,560
up you know of the average

335
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,500
cost and spend of a single breach of a

336
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,720
data breach is in the Millions

337
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,660
and suddenly your 20 grand or 50 Grand

338
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,920
or 100 grand

339
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,120
doesn't seem like very much

340
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,000
all right soft skills

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,160
I know it's fun

342
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,019
to talk about

343
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,180
hard skills and technical skills and we

344
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,740
all love geeking out

345
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,980
but if you're in a smaller company

346
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,040
and you're not in a leadership position

347
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
and like I said if you're a one-person

348
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
shop two-person shop

349
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,740
you need to know how to talk to people

350
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,620
you need to know how to convince people

351
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,560
that what you're saying is truthful and

352
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,019
that they need to trust you and there's

353
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,579
some skills that come in about that and

354
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,079
and like I said it comes into sales

355
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,820
basically you're selling them on why

356
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,540
they should believe you

357
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,500
this is a big one that I've had to work

358
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,740
on over the last 10 years or so

359
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,820
um

360
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,560
I worked at Apple for a couple years at

361
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
The Genius Bar and it's um

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,959
it's a tough job especially for what you

363
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,820
get paid for it but I did learn a lot

364
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,180
Apple does a great job on their training

365
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,639
and and their their their training their

366
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,600
leadership on how to train their

367
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,360
employees and how to talk to people

368
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,040
the one thing that I learned there is

369
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,380
that perception is reality if somebody

370
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,480
thinks you're not approachable you are

371
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,579
not approachable and there's a reason

372
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,459
for that uh one of the examples is that

373
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,139
when I would when I would get a

374
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,000
customer's device and we had 10 minute

375
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
call a 10-minute appointment times for

376
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,519
uh iOS devices and 15-minute deployment

377
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,980
times for MacBooks or Macs in general

378
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,680
and that's not a lot of time

379
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,339
so my perception going in there was I'm

380
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,360
going to get right to work on this

381
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
person's device I'm going to start

382
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,700
pulling the serial number and start

383
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,839
typing their paperwork as they're

384
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,100
talking as they're giving me the

385
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,940
information

386
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,639
the problem with that is is that that

387
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,339
customer oftentimes perceives that as

388
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,720
you don't care you don't care about

389
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,220
their problem you don't care that their

390
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,839
phone's broke you don't care that

391
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,639
they've lost data on their pictures even

392
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
though you do so it doesn't matter if

393
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,899
you actually care if they perceive you

394
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,880
not to care then that's all that matters

395
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,839
so I learned uh at that job and it's

396
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,639
it's crazy how well it works it seems

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,440
really simple now when somebody comes

398
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,720
into my office and needs help

399
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
um even though they haven't put in a

400
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,160
ticket

401
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,959
um I will stop what I'm doing I will it

402
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,000
depending on if where they sit or stand

403
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,300
I will close my computer I will give

404
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,459
them eye contact I will give them my

405
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,019
attention I'm not looking at my phone

406
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,180
I'm not looking at my watch I'm giving

407
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,560
my intention because they've come into

408
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,300
my office for help I'm getting paid to

409
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,800
help them and that's what I tell people

410
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
a lot of times because a lot of times

411
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,620
people think that they're bugging the

412
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,660
I.T person or the security person that

413
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,920
you've got better things to do than deal

414
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,779
with their issue and that what that

415
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,760
leads to is them not reporting stuff

416
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,139
they're not they're not going to bother

417
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,480
you oh well I clicked on a link but I

418
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,800
don't think it did anything so I'm not

419
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
going to buy I'm not going to bother him

420
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,279
you know so and that's what it leads to

421
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,839
and and I've had

422
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,699
and I like I said I've had to

423
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,440
consciously work on this it's not for

424
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,060
most of us it does not come second

425
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,740
nature most I would guess that most

426
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,500
people in here uh minus some sales

427
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,000
Engineers that are actually in that role

428
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
to do to do selling are not used to you

429
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
know selling people and and really

430
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,540
talking to people and really comfortable

431
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,440
with it

432
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
I'm what's called an introvert extrovert

433
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,019
Troy actually told me this last year and

434
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,600
so I can fake it really well but for the

435
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,839
most part I'm an introvert you know so

436
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,240
and like I said multitasking even though

437
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,800
you think you're being helpful you're

438
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,820
working on things and you're still

439
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,860
listening to them they don't see it that

440
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
way they think they think you're too

441
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,880
busy for them and you don't care about

442
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,279
their issue no matter how small it is

443
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,899
and the and you caring about their

444
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,000
smaller issues especially if it doesn't

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,620
seem that big maybe maybe you don't

446
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,360
understand why it's a big deal to them

447
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,980
maybe they didn't explain that they have

448
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,779
a project due in an hour and they just

449
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,579
need to fix this problem with PowerPoint

450
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,920
a lot of times they don't but if you

451
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,300
just take every problem seriously as

452
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,160
they come in there then when there is a

453
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,240
serious problem they're going to come to

454
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,880
you and I and I like I said I I I've

455
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,040
noticed that firsthand I I have people

456
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,139
come to me right after they click on a

457
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,519
link and say hey

458
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,800
you know I think I think this email is a

459
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
scam email and I clicked on it and I

460
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,899
typed this password in and so and then I

461
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,220
was able to fix it right away I was able

462
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,199
to take the machine and wipe it and and

463
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,699
mitigate it and then take it off the

464
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,740
network immediately not

465
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,600
a week from then when they like hey my

466
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,860
machine's acting weird and I clicked in

467
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,380
this link a week a week ago

468
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
and so

469
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,639
that trust that you're not going to get

470
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,980
up that's another thing too you can't

471
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,839
get upset with him you can't roll your

472
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
eyes you can't

473
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,899
you know all these little things that

474
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,699
people pick up on the the this body

475
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,920
language and this non-verbal

476
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,620
communication you have to you have to be

477
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,720
conscious of that and and sometimes it

478
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,940
even it even takes working out of the

479
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,320
mirror that you you see people

480
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
rehearsing their speeches in a mirror

481
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,600
for a reason because your face portrays

482
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,459
your emotions for most people's anyways

483
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,100
unless you're a sociopath I guess but

484
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,380
most people's faces portray their

485
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380
emotions so if you're annoyed if you're

486
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,300
frustrated even though some of us get

487
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,579
that way you have to at least try to

488
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,040
hide it you know and because that's how

489
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,139
people trust you they they trust that

490
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,940
that you're not going to get mad at them

491
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,140
you're not going to get upset with them

492
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,619
if somebody keeps clicking on links and

493
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,140
clips opening up emails

494
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,419
um depending on our organization I would

495
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,520
guess that most of the time that's not

496
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,020
your job to get upset with them that's

497
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,579
their managers that's their bosses

498
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,780
that's the owner of the company whatever

499
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,359
it is you shouldn't get to be the bad

500
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,740
guy you shouldn't have to be the bad guy

501
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,359
you should be the the person that

502
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,619
everybody can come to when they have an

503
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,880
issue

504
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,439
um like I said if they keep doing it

505
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,280
then that's a problem but you don't I I

506
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,260
personally don't want to be the be the

507
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,539
bad guy I think it's easier to do your

508
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,480
job when people don't hate you so hence

509
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,700
the reason this talk so

510
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,860
um when there's tons of good books on

511
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,140
this on this on these topics uh the one

512
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,820
that always stands out to me that and

513
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,100
that it sounds really cliche the one

514
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,140
that really changed my life and changed

515
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,539
how I deal with people is very popular a

516
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,620
lot of people have read it a lot of

517
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,179
people haven't How to Win Friends and

518
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,860
Influence People

519
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,539
um there's a ton of good information in

520
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,559
there I didn't even finish the whole

521
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,020
thing I had a I had an old boss that

522
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,460
that said especially with books like

523
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,780
that they're like self-help books and

524
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,039
such

525
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,320
um if you read it if you usually when

526
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,660
you read a book like that you get one

527
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,760
two three pieces of key information that

528
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,740
really ring true to you that really go

529
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,299
like wow I really need to do that that's

530
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,360
a great idea if you read halfway through

531
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
that book and you get those already move

532
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,600
on

533
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,880
like you know sometimes there's more

534
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
information in there if you still want

535
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,059
to read it that's fine but I don't know

536
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,260
I don't even remember what happened in

537
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,760
my life at the time I got about how like

538
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,799
I said about halfway through that book I

539
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,660
got several good pieces of her

540
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,160
information so I didn't want to force

541
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,140
myself to go back to that book even

542
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,760
there was so there's I'm a big book nerd

543
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,679
so I love reading books but

544
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,299
um like I said even even if you just

545
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,440
read some of the highlights of that book

546
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,480
there's some great stories in there

547
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
there's some great advice on how to deal

548
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,500
with people and and it it seems simple

549
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,080
but it is that simple humans are for the

550
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,360
most part are pretty simple creatures

551
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,820
and and communication and talking and

552
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,620
and and it seems intuitive at first

553
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,299
until you read it and you're like wow

554
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,220
okay that's really that not really that

555
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,940
simple so

556
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,620
uh I think I've got over this a little

557
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,460
bit

558
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,160
um sales uh back to How to Win Friends

559
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,480
and Influence People that's when I read

560
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,000
that book is when I was doing sales

561
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,620
um people like to talk about themselves

562
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,840
get to know people what their hobbies

563
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,840
are into don't discount that don't spend

564
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,160
a half an hour speaking talking to

565
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,020
somebody about cars or about photography

566
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,580
you're probably your boss is probably

567
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,559
not going to appreciate that on both

568
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,900
your ends but don't discount spend five

569
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,700
or ten minutes talking to somebody about

570
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,880
just about not about work it has value

571
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,460
you know those relationships have value

572
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,200
especially now that a lot of us are

573
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,580
working from home or not working in the

574
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,299
office

575
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,460
that's you have to work at it more to

576
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,080
get to know people and when people know

577
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,600
you they trust you like I said like I

578
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,940
know I've got a few friends at my office

579
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,220
that I even if even if something was

580
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,480
going wrong that nobody else wanted to

581
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,799
tell me I know they would come to me and

582
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,380
let me know and that that that has value

583
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,080
so don't don't discount that same same

584
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
thing with your bosses if if they trust

585
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
you and you you know and they trust what

586
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,799
you're saying is true and they like you

587
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,020
they're more aptly they're more apt to

588
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,940
to take your suggestions and Implement

589
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
things and give you money to spend on

590
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,760
things

591
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
so and this is all what sales is that if

592
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,740
you've ever done any sales at all

593
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,880
like I said they the the customer has to

594
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,380
like you if they don't like you they're

595
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,580
not going to trust you when you tell

596
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,559
them hey you need to spend you know

597
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,360
extra on this or you need to buy this

598
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,039
this is a great product you need to buy

599
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,600
it if they don't like you they're not

600
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,799
going to trust you and they're not going

601
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,179
to they're not going to take your your

602
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,220
word for anything so

603
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,020
um one of the great things that Apple

604
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,179
does with their sales people

605
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,760
is their training process and how to

606
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
talk to customers how to sell customers

607
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,880
on their devices if you ever get a

608
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,059
chance it go even if you don't want to

609
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,919
buy an Apple device I know that's a

610
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,100
polarizing Topic in this in this group

611
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,760
um

612
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,919
either go and observe how they talk to

613
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,660
customers or even just go and act like

614
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,660
you're a non-technical customer they're

615
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,100
not going to tell you that this device

616
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,960
has 32 gigs of RAM

617
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,059
they're going to explain why that why

618
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,039
what what benefits you get from having a

619
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
device that has 32 gigs of RAM they're

620
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,100
not going to tell you any technical

621
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,960
details from unless you ask I'm sure if

622
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,760
they ask they probably will you know if

623
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
you're a technical person and you don't

624
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,740
want 16 you want 32 or whatever it is

625
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,600
they'll tell you they know that stuff

626
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,580
obviously it's selling those devices but

627
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,100
most people don't care your boss doesn't

628
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,299
care for the most part unless they're a

629
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,640
technical person for the most part they

630
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,360
don't care you know you know what the

631
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,520
you know what features of your endpoint

632
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,760
security keep you safe or what features

633
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,799
Office 365 has when you buy an E1

634
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,020
license versus the you know versus a

635
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,640
regular business standard license you

636
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,320
know all the security features you have

637
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,880
they don't care about that stuff they

638
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,200
don't care about the technical details

639
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,299
they care about what it does for them in

640
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,400
the company and what it does for users

641
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,340
and the features the the benefits not

642
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,500
the features basically so that's that's

643
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
how you need to explain stuff to them

644
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,059
they don't care that you know this

645
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,559
endpoint is great against ransomware

646
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,419
protection and the exact details and how

647
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,460
it does it you're going to watch them

648
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,780
glaze over faster than anything and

649
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,340
they're you're going to lose them and so

650
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,260
that's why you need to explain you know

651
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,140
hey we need if we get a breach it's

652
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,240
going to cost us this much money and

653
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
that's exactly how I had a I had a

654
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,900
client that didn't want to spend money

655
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,880
on an antivirus at the time I was

656
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,460
working for an I.T consultancy and the

657
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
main product that we used was sofos

658
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,400
um

659
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,220
and I think at the time with their

660
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,440
ransomware protection it was like seven

661
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,940
or eight dollars an endpoint and they

662
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,200
were a smaller business they wouldn't

663
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,940
have the 10 15 endpoint something like

664
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,380
that and they didn't want to spend that

665
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,120
money it would have been a few a couple

666
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,559
hundred dollars hundred bucks a month or

667
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,240
something like that and I explained it

668
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,100
to him and I said hey if you if you get

669
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
a ransomware breach or any other data

670
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,039
breach

671
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,760
um

672
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,620
for me to clean that up and be sure that

673
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,240
it's gone be sure that they're not in

674
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,400
systems you're at least 10 to 15 hours

675
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,620
of my time at over 100 an hour that's

676
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,900
assuming you have no data loss you have

677
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,480
to recreate no work which is almost

678
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,580
impossible that's assuming you have no

679
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,580
downtime you have downtime you're paying

680
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
your employees now and they have no

681
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,240
connection they can't work like I said

682
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,539
just My Time is like I said 100 an hour

683
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,220
at 10 to 15 hours if not more like

684
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,320
that's just a conservative estimate and

685
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,419
there and that sold them he was like yep

686
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,460
you're right let's let's pay for it so

687
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,140
that's that's the way you have to break

688
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,400
this stuff down you have to let them

689
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,820
know uh it's it's tough for bosses to

690
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,039
know

691
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,679
to visualize that stuff because a lot of

692
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,780
people and and this is the this is this

693
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,179
this is a risk management thing they

694
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,799
think this is never going to happen to

695
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,900
me until it does that's the problem

696
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,520
that's the problem with with a lot of

697
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
this stuff is that they don't see this

698
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,080
happening oh we're not a Target we're

699
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,360
not a defense contractor we're not the

700
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
FBI we don't have you know we don't have

701
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,280
any super any two super top secret

702
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,440
but you have competitors and you have

703
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,940
actors out there that just want money

704
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,919
they don't care who you are especially

705
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,840
now that we're in the ransomware age you

706
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
know 20 or 30 years ago when the

707
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,740
ransomware was not a big thing there was

708
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,419
no you know a smaller business probably

709
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,580
didn't have any risk of getting targeted

710
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,679
it was probably really really low and

711
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,960
that's understandable and but you have

712
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,760
actors now that don't care who you are

713
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,320
they don't care that you're just a

714
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,419
mom-and-pop with you know a couple

715
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,580
hundred grand in Revenue they're still

716
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,720
going to get money out of you then when

717
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,780
you lock your files up so that's what

718
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,159
that's what people need to realize they

719
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,020
need you know and then maybe you need to

720
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,159
put it like that maybe you need to talk

721
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,039
to them about exactly obviously being an

722
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,240
I.T person you're going to know which

723
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,679
files are valuable

724
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,900
hey what happens if I shut that the

725
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,120
server was offline you know you couldn't

726
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,919
access your QuickBooks what would happen

727
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,320
how much of a problem would that be and

728
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,820
then they get to thinking well I use

729
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,280
QuickBooks like six times a day you know

730
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,360
and that's just me I'm not even the

731
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,740
accountant we didn't have all that

732
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,059
numbers and stuff we had to recreate all

733
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,700
that data that would take weeks and then

734
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,220
not to mention the time you would you

735
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,260
lost work at that time too that's where

736
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,299
you get those wheels turning about what

737
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,860
actually happened what the actual cost

738
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,760
of reach is going to be

739
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,980
communication

740
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,720
I know that a lot of speakers have spoke

741
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,580
about it I noticed a lot in the like I

742
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,100
said a couple of the Keynotes

743
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,059
give people

744
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,340
actionable facts when when you're

745
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,779
sending emails out what you want them to

746
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,779
do don't make it vague explain to them

747
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,460
hey this needs to be done by this date

748
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,500
or whatever it is you need to have

749
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,460
actual

750
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,200
actual facts in there what you need them

751
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,700
to do we need you to update your

752
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,500
computer we need you to do this you need

753
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,600
to do that don't make it vague it needs

754
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,179
to be very laid out and and if you have

755
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,919
to if you're if you're not used to

756
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,380
speaking to non-technical people

757
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,360
have a good friend that's not technical

758
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,159
review it say hey do you understand this

759
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,960
send it to them first

760
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,760
have them review it do you understand

761
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,500
this does this make sense do you have

762
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,600
any questions because I think a lot of

763
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,460
us realize is that we have a lot of this

764
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,559
knowledge and we just assume things a

765
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,980
lot of times and you can't do that

766
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,039
um

767
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,400
this one thing my boss taught me here

768
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
she was worked in the defense department

769
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,020
uh for I think of Defense contractors

770
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,960
and they had a limit on how many emails

771
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,520
they could send out

772
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,460
um basically from their bosses because

773
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,860
the more emails you send out

774
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,659
you know hey this new update came out

775
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,520
this thing came out the more people are

776
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,840
going to ignore them

777
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,460
you have to pick and choose what's

778
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,159
important to to email about to send to

779
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,500
to communicate about the more you send

780
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,520
out

781
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,919
the more people are going to start like

782
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,159
I said yeah just another email from it

783
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,900
just another update

784
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,539
so you have to be careful about that

785
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,120
um I I've been guilty of that especially

786
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,039
we have a lot of Max of the shop anybody

787
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,220
that's that has Max and and has and

788
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
operates them and and controls them

789
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,299
knows the amount of breaches that have

790
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,320
happened over the last couple they're

791
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,600
not breaches uh security issues that

792
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,980
they've had over the last couple years

793
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,580
the some of the remote execution more

794
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,440
remote code execution bugs that I've had

795
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,179
out that have been being actively

796
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,440
exploited

797
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,419
um I mean the amount that have happened

798
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,820
for iOS and for Mac OS over the last

799
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,980
couple years has been much much higher

800
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,539
than in the past from what I've seen

801
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,980
anyways so

802
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,740
um you have to be careful about you know

803
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,779
being Chicken Little when the sky's not

804
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,760
really falling kind of thing so you have

805
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,480
to balance that

806
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,520
talked about this earlier

807
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,120
um

808
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,220
not just your friends a couple of people

809
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,779
that are you know are

810
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,360
less technical users

811
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,919
have a group of people that you can roll

812
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,980
things out to First and test it

813
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,580
um

814
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,799
you can have a really bad time

815
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,960
if you click the wrong box and you send

816
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,179
something out incorrectly

817
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,140
um I I experienced this with our MDM I

818
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,700
was trying to push a password policy out

819
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,779
to our computers and I did not test this

820
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,779
as real world as I was going to use it

821
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,640
when I when I actually pushed it out for

822
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,360
real and it thankfully only pushed it

823
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
out to a few years a few users

824
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,940
but it did cause some problems I found

825
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,520
out after I pushed the password policy

826
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,220
out that my plan was to create the

827
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,179
policy

828
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,940
and push it out to five or ten users and

829
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,919
then add five or ten users to that and

830
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,080
then in another week or so after they

831
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,340
change their passwords add a few more

832
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,620
few more users and roll it out slowly

833
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,299
over time

834
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,520
the problem was the documentation for

835
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,100
our MDM did not make it clear that every

836
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,779
time you made a change to that password

837
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,539
policy it pushed the whole thing out to

838
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,820
all the devices again so if there's a

839
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,039
force reset in there and you add devices

840
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,260
two or three times and hit save two or

841
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,360
three times all those devices get to

842
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,059
reset their password multiple times and

843
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,159
that cues them up so you change your

844
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,179
password

845
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,980
you lock your machine go log back in

846
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,720
again you get to change your password

847
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,440
again so needless to say

848
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,899
the few users that I got sent to were

849
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,720
not very happy with me if I had to

850
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,679
pushed it out to the whole company

851
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,860
including the the uh the owners of the

852
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,840
company I probably would have been a

853
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,260
whole lot worse uh I as it was I only

854
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,820
end up having to wipe one machine

855
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,100
because I didn't have encryption Keys

856
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,740
saved for that MacBook uh

857
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,960
in sofos so that I could when they

858
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,760
basically they use this user type their

859
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,320
change their password for the second or

860
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,940
third time and they typed it in

861
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,440
Incorrect and must have bumped the wrong

862
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,340
key and locked themselves out so wiping

863
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,840
one machine and wiping 20 and 30

864
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,820
machines and trying to recover data from

865
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,000
them is a whole lot better so

866
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,860
um learned learn from my mistakes learn

867
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,559
from others mistakes you know and and

868
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,600
and test things as real world as

869
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
possible the exactly how you're going to

870
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,559
use them as as much as possible if you

871
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,899
can have a test bench that's even better

872
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,460
something that you can easily blow away

873
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,380
and you can you can you know wipe if you

874
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,240
had to if you screw it up

875
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,399
um and like I said test it on users that

876
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,960
aren't going to get too mad at you if

877
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,279
they you really screw their computer up

878
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,960
ones that you know that they have their

879
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,179
data backed up or it's on Dropbox or box

880
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,580
or OneDrive or whatever so that you do

881
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,860
have you do screw their computer up it's

882
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,939
not going to be that big of a deal

883
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,820
um this is kind of getting into the

884
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,080
little the CIS stuff

885
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,039
Troy did a talk of this a couple years

886
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,539
ago this is where I first found this

887
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,039
like I said I'm a little new to him for

888
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,659
a second General

889
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,820
um it seems really basic

890
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,760
inventory you know password policies

891
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,500
hardening

892
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,020
um but a lot of teams I've seen people

893
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,539
uh I've seen people that I've known that

894
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,919
have been more experienced that don't

895
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,600
that aren't doing this stuff and I know

896
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,659
a lot it seems like I said the Keynotes

897
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,340
I know Jason preached on this if you

898
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,480
don't know what devices are on your

899
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,380
network

900
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,480
you have a problem you need to do that

901
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,220
it's a basic thing that a lot of people

902
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,960
are not doing we're not doing that and

903
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm working on it right now

904
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,980
um it's it's tougher than you think

905
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,440
um especially if you don't have

906
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
leadership buy-in if people are buying

907
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,299
machines that aren't going through it

908
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,760
and they have you know there's how many

909
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,320
people in your how many people in your

910
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,179
organization have credit cards and they

911
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,159
need something they just go and buy it

912
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,559
that's a problem

913
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,059
unless you have controls set up where

914
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,260
they can't put that device in the

915
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,179
network until it goes through you that's

916
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,980
another thing we're working on too if

917
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,360
anybody can just put any device on the

918
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,340
network if they know the password

919
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,860
you're gonna you're in for a bad time

920
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,380
um I I had to find out the hard way that

921
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,299
just allowing people to plug in devices

922
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,120
into the network and the hardware or uh

923
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,559
Wireless

924
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,419
um somebody's going to bring a router in

925
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,039
and turn on a DHCP server and start

926
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,320
handing on IP addresses

927
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,419
so that was the day that I turned on

928
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,580
Port security so

929
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,899
you don't think you need it until you

930
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,880
need it did I lose this you ready to

931
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,440
hear me

932
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,640
oh

933
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,020
maybe it was just a little louder before

934
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,760
okay

935
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,340
all right so uh same with software

936
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,320
inventory

937
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,179
um when this is something we didn't have

938
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,940
any put in place when log 4J came out I

939
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,200
had no clue if we had anything running

940
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
that none

941
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,140
I had to go and start asking our

942
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,880
developers I was like hey do we have

943
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,179
anything that runs this they didn't know

944
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,659
that's a problem when a when you can you

945
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,399
can be on top of this stuff as much as

946
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
you want and right when that stuff comes

947
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,539
out and know exactly how to fix it but

948
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:43,919
if you don't know if you're running that

949
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,899
or where all those machines are at

950
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,779
you're going to have a problem uh that's

951
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,520
that's what happened with Equifax I

952
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,659
don't know if anybody is aware of

953
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,520
exactly what happened they missed the

954
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,039
machine they they I think I believe it

955
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,659
was it was an Apache bug I can't

956
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,460
remember exactly the details but I know

957
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,440
they the company that or that size

958
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,779
didn't have controls in place to make

959
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,279
sure that they had everything patched

960
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,440
they missed the machine and the hacker

961
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
is gonna excuse me I don't want to use

962
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,860
that word a bad actor is going to make

963
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,600
you pay for that all they need is one

964
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,760
time all you all you need is all you

965
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,679
need to do is Miss one you don't need 50

966
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,000
machines that are available you just

967
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,919
need one and that's all they need and

968
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,440
they found it and so you have to have an

969
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,000
inventory of this stuff and know exactly

970
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,980
what's been patched and what you have

971
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,299
what you're running what software you're

972
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,880
running so in order to keep your network

973
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,360
secure

974
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,140
um I guess I could kind of jumped ahead

975
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,720
of myself a little bit here so

976
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,640
um yeah like this was a bit this is

977
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
something we're getting under control

978
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,460
that like I said I've been in the the

979
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,220
company now three years now and all of a

980
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,240
sudden people would just show up with a

981
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,860
new device and I was like

982
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,620
where'd you get that oh my boss bought

983
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,380
it for me okay can I have it I need to

984
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,059
put you know endpoint Security on it I

985
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,740
need to put patch management I need to

986
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,779
record an inventory and a lot of times

987
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,519
that I wouldn't even see it a lot of

988
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,140
times devices would just show up on the

989
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,779
network and I was like okay who's who's

990
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,960
got a new Macbook so you have everything

991
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,119
has to run through somebody some point

992
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,800
of contact in it so you so you know

993
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,719
what's on your network or you have to

994
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,879
have security controls or better you

995
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,199
have to have security controls that

996
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,699
doesn't even allow them to have access

997
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,560
to anything unless they go through you

998
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,020
has to be added and that's tough to do

999
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,418
sometimes that's that's it's a whole lot

1000
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,159
easier to just spin up a wireless

1001
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,540
network and put a password on it and

1002
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,520
give it out to anybody everybody so a

1003
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,659
lot of businesses do unfortunately

1004
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,980
that's what ours did for the longest

1005
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,020
time R said the same password on the

1006
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,960
Wi-Fi for 10 plus years over a building

1007
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,739
move

1008
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,839
and I'm sure that there was in that that

1009
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,639
10 plus years there was nobody that was

1010
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,040
fired or let go and it was disgruntled

1011
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
at all they would still have that Wi-Fi

1012
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
password

1013
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,399
um

1014
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,659
yeah along I think a lot of people at

1015
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,000
times think of inventory as just

1016
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,920
Hardware inventory but like I said it's

1017
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,980
it's software too along with this

1018
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,420
um this is another way you can push this

1019
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,859
too there's another way you can get

1020
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,300
money for just spending on patch

1021
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,760
management and asset inventory is that

1022
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,920
we had a problem with with people

1023
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,560
needing an Office 365 license and they

1024
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,000
didn't know where to get it so they just

1025
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,200
whip out their company credit card and

1026
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,240
sign up and then three or four years

1027
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,820
later when we've got the company they've

1028
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,500
got a company license they're still

1029
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,940
getting charged for that

1030
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,800
so how many how many other how much does

1031
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
this happen on your company where people

1032
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,920
are just buying licenses we found out

1033
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,320
that we had we had more Dropbox licenses

1034
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,180
at our company than we had employees

1035
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,599
like by like 30 or 40 percent

1036
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,780
and that gets expensive really fast I I

1037
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,640
found a uh

1038
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,900
I don't remember what the name of the it

1039
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,660
was like a online file server type

1040
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,280
program kind of like Dropbox and

1041
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,780
OneDrive

1042
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,380
um

1043
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,880
it was about six or seven hundred

1044
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,820
dollars a year that we had nobody had

1045
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,920
touched for like two or three years

1046
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,660
and I've been finding stuff like that

1047
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,339
all the time so when you have that stuff

1048
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,760
recorded and somebody's checking on that

1049
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,780
stuff

1050
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,940
they know that hey we stopped using that

1051
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,740
we need to cancel that this year when

1052
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,060
you have to be able to document the

1053
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,859
ability to document that stuff and

1054
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,720
record it in a central place where

1055
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,940
somebody's watching it you can save your

1056
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,500
company money and like I said if

1057
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
nobody's watching it it's a free-for-all

1058
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,460
I guarantee there's waste

1059
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,099
um my boss calculated over 100 Grand

1060
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,440
that we they were wasting licenses that

1061
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,420
we're paying for that nobody's using or

1062
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,099
that we've got duplicates of

1063
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,020
so

1064
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,619
um

1065
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,839
the company I work for is not huge 100

1066
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
Grand is a lot of freaking money

1067
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,800
depending on the size of your company it

1068
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,660
could be or could not be but that's all

1069
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,920
that's 100 Grand that could be going

1070
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,660
towards I.T and security

1071
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,339
that was just wasted they literally lit

1072
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,900
on fire

1073
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,700
figuratively sorry not literally

1074
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,400
figuratively lit on fire

1075
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
um

1076
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,720
so yeah it's it's all about finding the

1077
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,119
angle to get you to get to get money to

1078
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,579
spend on on security and and if you can

1079
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,619
save them money and it's not just an

1080
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,540
overhead expense

1081
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,339
your CFO will love you for that

1082
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,980
um patch management kind of comes back

1083
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,160
to software inventory a little bit they

1084
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,900
kind of go hand in hand I think it's

1085
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,940
been in my experience anyways

1086
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,859
um if you don't know what you have or

1087
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,320
what software version is running

1088
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,099
um

1089
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,020
then it's kind of tough to know if

1090
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,480
everything's up to date

1091
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,920
users I have users I don't know if I'm

1092
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,500
guessing everybody has this raise your

1093
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,640
hand if you have users that leave

1094
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,619
browsers open for weeks at a time and

1095
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,839
and hundreds of tabs

1096
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,200
and then and then when a problem happens

1097
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,400
they lose their mind that you want them

1098
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,040
to completely close their browser

1099
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,020
so that's the only way that browser

1100
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,400
updates you leave it open it's not going

1101
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
to update they the browser is Chrome and

1102
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
Firefox and brave all are great about

1103
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,820
pushing automatic updates but if they

1104
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,380
ignore that little update button in the

1105
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,099
top

1106
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,140
doesn't matter if you don't close your

1107
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,060
browser restart your computer it's not

1108
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,000
going to update so if you don't if you

1109
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,859
don't have any way to track what version

1110
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,780
of software that is on it and you have

1111
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,760
more than a few machines you have to

1112
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
there's no way you can do that manually

1113
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,540
and I and I found out I find that out

1114
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,460
too now that I have a I have patch

1115
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,140
Management in place and I can see in a

1116
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,240
central location they the the company

1117
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
that I use it's I think it's manage

1118
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
engine

1119
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,700
even Flags severity of patches too so

1120
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,140
that's that's less work for me I don't

1121
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,940
have to go and track down which patches

1122
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,440
I need to do which ones I don't need to

1123
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,359
do which ones I need to prioritize they

1124
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,400
give me a little colored box and the red

1125
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,839
ones I do first

1126
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,820
it's you know it seems simple once you

1127
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,160
have it in place

1128
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,500
um along with this especially the way

1129
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,300
new laptops are people need to have

1130
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,339
backups and I and I know like probably

1131
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,040
half my employees do not uh

1132
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,339
if a patch pushes out wrong it could

1133
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,960
screw a computer up and you have to wipe

1134
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,700
it and reinstall if you've got a backup

1135
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,920
probably not a big deal it's a minor

1136
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,960
inconvenience an hour or two if you

1137
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,280
don't have a backup

1138
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,980
depending on the on the user that's

1139
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,839
probably kind of a big deal

1140
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,940
um with like most modern laptops

1141
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,859
nowadays you can't just pull a hard

1142
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,599
drive out of them you know and pull the

1143
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,460
files off of them that's not a thing

1144
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,440
especially if you've got a Macbook I

1145
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,880
think a lot of other manufacturers are

1146
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,240
going to that now too where uh that that

1147
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,280
drive and the SSD and stuff are soldered

1148
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,020
onto the board that's becoming more and

1149
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,359
more of a thing so

1150
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,300
that's that's a much much bigger idea to

1151
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,460
to back up if you're if you're going to

1152
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,820
push updates and make people restart

1153
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,040
their computers

1154
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
um you need to be cying and at least

1155
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,540
letting them know that I can't recover

1156
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,000
your data if your computer crashes if it

1157
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
doesn't power on your data is gone I

1158
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,140
don't think the company is going to

1159
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,240
spend 10 or 15 grand to set out to a

1160
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,000
data recovery Place uh most depending on

1161
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,380
the on the data they're probably not

1162
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,540
they're just going to be kind of out of

1163
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,720
luck

1164
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,619
uh I guess I got ahead of myself again

1165
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,599
uh backups

1166
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
and uh

1167
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,200
same thing with ransomware a lot of

1168
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,900
people know that the only real strategy

1169
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,020
against ransomware foolproof is a backup

1170
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,480
and an offline backup

1171
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,920
I've got a hard drive that I plug into

1172
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,000
the server

1173
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,020
um there's there's several backup

1174
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,760
programs now that will disconnect the

1175
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,440
hard drive after it's been backing up

1176
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,599
that's that's that's the best way as far

1177
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,760
as I'm concerned to make a backup so you

1178
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,140
don't have to actually manually unplug

1179
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,180
it all the time

1180
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,920
uh

1181
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,720
if you're not testing your backups at

1182
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,800
least pulling a file out of the

1183
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,599
receiving if it can open

1184
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,520
if you can test the full backup a full

1185
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,320
restore of a server that's great

1186
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,300
sometimes that's not plausible sometimes

1187
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,680
you don't have a whole test bench and

1188
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
you don't have another 10 grand to spend

1189
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,820
on replacement on duplicate servers to

1190
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,980
spin that backup back up but just even

1191
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,839
even opening that back up and pulling

1192
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,040
some files out of there and see if they

1193
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
open up Word files PowerPoint files

1194
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,359
whatever it is you can catch a crop

1195
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,160
backup like that a lot of times I've had

1196
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,260
it happen where I open a file up and it

1197
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,180
just it just will not read or it opens

1198
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,760
up and it's just garbled basically and

1199
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,680
you can do another full backup and check

1200
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,260
it again if you're not testing them just

1201
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,119
like just like all the just like a lot

1202
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,740
of these these policies and stuff like

1203
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,240
that if you're not testing them you're

1204
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,680
not running through real world scenarios

1205
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,820
with your employees when they happen

1206
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,320
what they need to do

1207
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,359
you're not you're not you're not going

1208
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,560
to have the results you need when

1209
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,700
there's an actual emergency when you

1210
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,380
actually need that backup you need to

1211
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,599
have a policy in place a schedule in

1212
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,560
place where we're testing this stuff

1213
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,040
regularly

1214
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,940
okay I guess I'm a little early here

1215
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,180
um

1216
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,579
I'm guessing obviously preaching the

1217
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,079
choir a little bit in here

1218
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,960
this is just the beginning this is not

1219
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,880
this talk was not supposed to be some

1220
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,380
comprehensive on how to secure a network

1221
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,359
there's lots more stuff to do there's

1222
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,099
lots more interesting that CIS the just

1223
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,960
that CES is kind of a kind of a basic

1224
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,520
start basically they even though it's

1225
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,260
kind of a comprehensive

1226
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,320
um

1227
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,700
risk management is what we do all the

1228
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,099
time our building has clients that come

1229
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,079
in there all the time I I'm not even

1230
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,339
there half the time when they're there

1231
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,380
at night time in different Towers we run

1232
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,420
events out of there stuff like that you

1233
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,640
have to control for users you have to

1234
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,280
protect users from themselves you have

1235
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,839
to assume that they're going to plug

1236
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,460
they're going to plug machines into your

1237
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,380
network and you have to plan for that

1238
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,760
you have to assume that somebody's going

1239
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
to bring a router in from outside and

1240
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,400
because they didn't have enough good

1241
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,720
enough Wi-Fi in their office and just

1242
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,680
plug it in

1243
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,140
and and your network has to be hardened

1244
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,119
against that you you can't just allow

1245
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,160
that it's is it a pain in the butt to

1246
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,240
have to to

1247
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,280
you know turn Port Security on and off

1248
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,900
when somebody changes machines

1249
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,180
yeah but it's more of a pain to try to

1250
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,060
hunt down a rogue DHCP server or or find

1251
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,320
out later that you had a rogue access

1252
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,480
point and and there there was somebody

1253
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,520
from outside that they left open and got

1254
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,540
in your network

1255
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,700
it's it's you get a you get to pay one

1256
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,500
way or the other one one weighs a whole

1257
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,180
lot less painful

1258
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,819
um like I said the the CIS controls it's

1259
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:02,760
it's it's crazy how how well done they

1260
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,099
are and going exactly over step by step

1261
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,440
by step exactly what you need to do

1262
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,220
um

1263
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,680
but

1264
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
you need to prioritize what's what's

1265
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,680
right for your company like I said the

1266
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,480
port security was not a priority in our

1267
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,700
company until it wasn't like I said

1268
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,280
until until somebody plugged in a router

1269
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,099
and I had users getting random random IP

1270
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,920
addresses so uh that got moved to the

1271
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,780
front of the list so you need to assess

1272
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,160
your risk if you don't have anybody

1273
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,140
coming into your office

1274
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,680
um

1275
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,380
and uh you know random clients plugging

1276
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,000
in random machines that's probably not

1277
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,800
as much of a priority you know asset you

1278
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,540
know asset manager is probably more of a

1279
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,280
priority you have to worry about what

1280
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,780
where your employees machines and your

1281
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,460
users machines are at rather than people

1282
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,260
coming in from the outside but if you've

1283
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,760
got all if you've got the general public

1284
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,200
coming into your offices and you've got

1285
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,640
ports out where the general public can

1286
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,400
access and and like I said to our office

1287
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,380
we have we have clients that are needing

1288
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,180
internet access and stuff like that so

1289
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,980
what I have to have a plan in place to

1290
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,300
give them internet access that doesn't

1291
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,099
have access to our Network so

1292
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:03,540
everybody's company is going to be

1293
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,980
different you have to you know

1294
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,020
prioritize yours depending on your risk

1295
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,599
so

1296
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,160
and that's it

1297
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,660
okay anybody have any questions

1298
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:31,920
I haven't specifically but um

1299
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,859
that's that's I think a world that

1300
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,319
software inventory can comes in you have

1301
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,900
to automate that software inventory I

1302
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,359
haven't I haven't got to that point but

1303
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,740
I'm guessing there's got to be products

1304
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,839
that can alert you when a new piece of

1305
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,240
software has been installed depending on

1306
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,819
your situation

1307
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm still working on getting local admin

1308
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,180
removed from a lot of our computers so

1309
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,400
you know it's it's priorities at this at

1310
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,640
that point so like the people at my

1311
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,200
company was the Wild West for so long

1312
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,300
that it's just going to be baby steps

1313
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,640
getting that little you know you know

1314
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,680
taking a little bit of time and making

1315
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,359
people realize that

1316
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,280
now you probably don't need to just

1317
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,839
install whatever program you want

1318
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,300
whenever you want to like you I get it's

1319
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,579
easier you know when you you don't need

1320
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:18,720
to come find me when you need to install

1321
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,460
a program but you probably don't really

1322
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,560
need that you know for the most part we

1323
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,420
can plan ahead with a little bit of

1324
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,579
planning we can plan ahead for that

1325
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,500
um so I I think there's there's a

1326
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,660
mixture of solutions to that problem

1327
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,160
obviously the software inventory is one

1328
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,500
of them flagging stuff that that you

1329
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,540
guys don't normally use that are like I

1330
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,000
said products like TeamViewer the people

1331
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,160
that are free for home use and then and

1332
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,780
then they want to make you pay

1333
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,060
um they're thankfully not as aggressive

1334
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,740
about sending letters and and and

1335
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,960
wanting money back because you're using

1336
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,359
it they just excuse me they just lock

1337
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,000
you out of it basically they find that

1338
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,680
they if they detect commercial use they

1339
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,940
just kind of lock your account kind of

1340
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,680
thing so I think that's a mixture of

1341
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,420
things I think I I to me I think the

1342
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,859
solution is not letting users install

1343
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,300
whatever they want whenever they want it

1344
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,240
and making requests but um if you're

1345
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,339
just a one-person shop two-person shop

1346
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:09,960
sometimes it's not that's not always

1347
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,940
feasible we have we've we have account

1348
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,800
Executives going out to events at all

1349
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,200
hours of the the day and night and I I

1350
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,700
don't know about you but I don't want to

1351
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,859
get phone calls at 11 PM on a Sunday

1352
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,359
night you know needing a program

1353
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,220
installed right now that doesn't sound

1354
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,560
like very much fun to me so

1355
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,960
um it's it's all a case-by-case basis on

1356
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,460
what works for you

1357
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,579
so cool anybody else

1358
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:35,300
I can't see

1359
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,980
okay I think I don't I think that's it

1360
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,839
perfect thanks guys
