1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
welcome I hope you're having a great

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,080
Saint con experience already

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,700
um I'm just going to take two seconds

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,980
before I start into my presentation and

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,260
just say thank you for for coming and

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,200
trusting Saint Khan with your training

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,780
money or your I get to go to a one

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,420
conference a year opportunity and those

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,699
kinds of things we're so pleased to

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,640
bring a high value great content

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,060
conference to Utah and to our local

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,300
community and so we're we're super

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,940
pleased to be able to do it we're just

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,100
blown away by the response and how big

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,239
and crazy uh it it's getting so anyways

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,180
I am Troy Jessup I go by Jupiter as my

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,379
handle

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,940
um I've been doing cyber security and

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,360
infosec for longer than before it was

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,640
sexy and cool

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
um it's about 25 almost 30 years of some

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
sort of cyber security or I.T related

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,079
types of field which also kind of makes

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,960
me old I think so I'll wear glasses

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
every once in a while up here as well

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,640
but we're here to talk today about risk

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,100
acceptance and as I was talking to my

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,700
mom at the end of the back of the uh

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,439
room here just a little bit ago this is

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,119
going to be kind of like you're all

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,920
pretty culturally aware about Utah but

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,880
this is going to be like that general

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,100
conference talk that you fall asleep on

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
you know Sunday afternoon session kind

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,780
of thing because this isn't that really

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,360
super exciting kind of topic it's not

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,740
the thing that you're coming to Saint

38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,380
Khan to really dig in and learn but it

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,840
is an important process that we all

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,780
could use some Refreshers uh maybe some

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,000
discussion and that there's some gaps

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,619
that we can maybe fill with some of the

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,700
information that we have here and so

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,799
that's my goal here is to see if I can

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,619
fill a gap that you might have or make

46
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,939
you think a little bit outside of the

47
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,200
box for risk acceptance but risk is kind

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,939
of a big deal so let's talk about risk

49
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,380
uh if unless you've been hiding under a

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,780
rock you know or whatever you should

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
have at least some understanding of what

52
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,759
risk is I I would assume that I'm mostly

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,979
talking to it and Security Professionals

54
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,220
in the room and so we do risk

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,120
um acceptance all day every day

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,180
365 days a year kind of thing and risk

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,700
is risk okay it's hard to really put a

58
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,340
solid definition on risk but it are the

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,160
things that make us vulnerable to some

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,040
sort of outside influence coming in and

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,319
making us have a bad day right it's a

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,900
the risk of a compromise would be one

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,420
example the risk of some sort of data

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,660
breach or data exfiltration or data

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
exposure or those kinds of things we're

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,440
all familiar with these types of risks

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
and our jobs or what we think are our

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,180
jobs as it and Security Professionals is

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,120
to understand that risk and put things

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
in place and and everything to try and

71
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,400
mitigate it as much as possible

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,260
and so

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,959
um risk acceptance up here I'm saying

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
risk is risk and it exists regardless of

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,980
anything we do does that resonate with

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,519
everybody whether we do something about

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,620
a risk that is either identified or not

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,580
identified does it keep it from existing

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,319
no it doesn't right that risk is going

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,420
to be there no matter what it's what we

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,159
do to either

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,379
remove the risk or mitigate the risk

83
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,300
that makes the difference and so it's

84
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,640
critical to have these types of

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
processes in place and there's five

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,560
major domains around risk acceptance if

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,540
this is super remedial for you just pay

88
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,099
attention or you know kind of drift off

89
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,840
for a minute surf the web what you're

90
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,519
going to do and then we'll come back to

91
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,140
some more important things but for the

92
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,180
refresher it is critical that when you

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,980
are in your role as an I.T or security

94
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,739
professional to identify risk that's one

95
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,560
of your primary jobs more so if you're a

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,599
security professional then if you're an

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,640
I.T professional but one could argue

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,280
there's a lot of overlap there right so

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,060
identifying it defining risk is a key

100
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,920
component to a risk acceptance process

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,900
as well and I'm going to dig into some

102
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,760
of these in a little bit more depth

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,780
later

104
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,200
but defining it documenting it how many

105
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,500
of you guys might raise of hands have a

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,640
process in place within your

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,519
organization where you have at least

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,139
some risk

109
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,320
that is inherent to your organization

110
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,340
documented somewhere on a piece of paper

111
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
maybe it's just an email that I sent up

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
to the CEO and said hey this is a bad

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
idea or whatever right okay and the

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,139
things I'm not seeing a lot of hands and

115
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,820
that's pretty typical and part of the

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,040
reason why I wanted to so badly to do

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,419
this talk this year even though it's a

118
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,060
kind of a boring mundane topic it's

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,639
super important because we need to be

120
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,280
doing a lot better job in Risk

121
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,160
definition and risk acceptance processes

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,500
so documentation not a lot of us are

123
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,660
doing that how about security controls

124
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,460
and other things that are preventing

125
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,620
risk how many of you guys have some

126
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,320
security control in place to mitigate

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,080
risk okay 99 of the hands should go up

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,820
because if you have a firewall hey

129
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,320
that's a pretty good security control

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,139
right to start with there's so many more

131
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,460
layers we can talk about here in a

132
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,860
little bit and then monitoring risk how

133
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,380
many of you guys have had an opportunity

134
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,199
to identify some risk talk about it

135
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,360
maybe come up with some processes to

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,699
mitigate some of the risk and go through

137
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,940
this whole process and then don't ever

138
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,160
revisit it again

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
you never go back and say Hey you know

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
we did that one thing to the server

141
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,080
three years ago

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,840
and opened up those ports that we

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,820
probably shouldn't have but it was

144
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,620
justified at the time is it still

145
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,199
Justified today kind of thing right and

146
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,280
here's the thing I'm already going

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,020
through half of the slides that I've got

148
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,840
prepared uh by just mumbling here so

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
this is going to be an interesting talk

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,060
this is also one of those talks that

151
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,780
um

152
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,300
I'll just set the the stage

153
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,539
I have I'm riddled with ADD types of

154
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,680
Tendencies so I'm going to be all over

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,380
the place I hope you can follow along

156
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,580
this particular slide right here I want

157
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,380
to talk about a risk acceptance process

158
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,620
in general okay defining and identifying

159
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,639
risk and we document the risk and we

160
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,680
explore compensating controls but this

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,180
is where the math comes in see if you

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,180
can follow me on the math risk minus

163
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,460
compensating controls everybody

164
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,840
understands what compensating controls

165
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,220
are right we'll cover them a little bit

166
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,020
more in a minute but risk minus

167
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,180
compensating controls equals mitigated

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,120
risk okay should be a pretty familiar

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,300
math equation for you and unmitigated

170
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,840
risk minus mitigated risk equals risk to

171
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,580
be accepted does that resonate with

172
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,460
everybody seems like a pretty reasonable

173
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,620
conclusion here I don't know I haven't

174
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,180
put a lot of numbers into the math

175
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,220
equation so there might be some errors

176
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,560
and issues in there but in essence that

177
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,880
should resonate

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
okay and so what what I want to do is

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,020
kind of take us through a couple of

180
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,180
these processes and I promise not to be

181
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,280
super long-winded with it but how do we

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,860
identify risk okay in fact I'm going to

183
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,539
come back here not let you cheat and I'm

184
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,699
going to pull the audience here

185
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,560
who has an example of how you are

186
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,520
identifying risk within your

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,660
organization anybody have a good

188
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,220
suggestion and there might be a Yoda

189
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,620
mini badge or two in it for you

190
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,160
go ahead

191
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,479
okay so Gap analysis against security

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,880
Frameworks okay great one over here

193
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,759
okay internal reporting so internal

194
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,680
information and things actually I'll

195
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,360
just have these this is my sweet wife by

196
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,199
the way

197
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,020
who has decided many well not many years

198
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
A couple of years ago that instead of

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
being a widow for six months out of the

200
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,419
Year while I work on Saint Khan she's

201
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,340
part of our volunteers and she does so

202
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,900
many awesome things she'll hand out some

203
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,780
Yoda mini badges

204
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,800
[Applause]

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
so okay so internal reporting anybody

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,520
else throw them out go ahead

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,479
vulnerability scanning penetration desk

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
great one suck

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,580
okay sock 2 compliance or Regulatory

210
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
Compliance of different types HIPAA

211
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,319
FERPA those kinds of things did anybody

212
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
else have any other unique ones back

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,620
here

214
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,419
data sensitivity take me through that

215
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,500
one just a little bit how does that

216
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,460
inform your risk

217
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,300
okay so okay in my mind I'm thinking

218
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,099
data sensitivity is a little bit

219
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,660
different in my mind than data

220
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,280
classification but I totally get your

221
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,259
your Jive here back in the back

222
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,719
okay user access and segregation of Duty

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,760
reviews what do we sometimes find in

224
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,419
those types of reviews

225
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,500
over privileging right role-based access

226
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,899
controls like hey somebody gave this

227
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,240
person administrative access to the the

228
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
active directory domain because they

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,980
needed to install a printer right that

230
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,959
never got undone way back in the back

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,779
foreign

232
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,880
process of review again or monitor that

233
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,459
risk great ones okay so all those are

234
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,140
all great suggestions these are just a

235
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,820
couple of the high level ones that I put

236
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,740
on the slide many of these have already

237
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,720
been talked about but one of the first

238
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,580
ones that I don't think we captured

239
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,700
really well uh from the audience was new

240
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,000
change or sorry new or change in

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
projects or initiatives how many of you

242
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,260
have had some CFO CTO CEO CEO

243
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,240
we blame all those three letter per

244
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,459
people right come down and say hey by

245
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,080
the way there's this cool new initiative

246
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
that we're going to start doing we are

247
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,519
going to put web servers on every phone

248
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,560
right or we're going to turn on SSH for

249
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,600
every single device because that makes

250
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
it secure right

251
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,380
how many of you guys have experienced

252
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,700
something like that does anybody want to

253
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
share one really quick there might be

254
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,200
another Yoda mini badge in it for you

255
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,640
that's okay oh go ahead

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,959
okay

257
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,680
expressions

258
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,800
right okay and so identifying maybe

259
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,540
vulnerability scam found out how did you

260
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,100
find or was that a summer initiative

261
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,740
from some higher up I mean I guess what

262
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm trying to get to is it's inevitable

263
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,580
that you're going to be told hey we're

264
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,440
doing this new thing

265
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,380
and we we've got to we've got to do it

266
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
it's business case and and everything

267
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,220
else and you know darn good and well

268
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,320
that this is a bad idea right go ahead

269
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,079
things

270
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,540
okay so in case you didn't hear it in

271
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,100
the back he's talking about hey we've

272
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,360
been having problems with email and so

273
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
we're not going to require every single

274
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,740
phone to have a VPN back in the back one

275
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,959
more right behind sorry one more back

276
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,979
really loud

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,399
ooh collecting coveted immunization card

278
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,920
images and then storing them somewhere

279
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,339
on a organized hey that's a great story

280
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,380
for the vent

281
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,140
um event later okay in case I'm sorry

282
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,000
Segway if you're going to follow my ADD

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,220
for just a second that vent event is

284
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,899
going to be off the chain by the way if

285
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,300
you have these fun stories that happened

286
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,060
into a hypothetical organization at a

287
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,279
hypothetical time and you want to go

288
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,260
share with other people that can feel

289
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,420
your pain that's a great place to do

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,459
that but no thank you for sharing so

291
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,620
it's things like that we take in all

292
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,240
these new changes and new initiatives

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,880
and and things and it creates risk that

294
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,620
needs to be assessed and it's going to

295
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,000
take us an hour or two to get through

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
all this if I don't hurry vulnerability

297
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,180
scans we talked about that penetration

298
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
tests tabletop exercises I just had an

299
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,860
opportunity just recently to sit in on a

300
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,079
tabletop exercise where we involve the

301
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,899
FBI sisa and a couple of other

302
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,140
organizations uh the local state sciac

303
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,600
and others in a tabletop exercise for a

304
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,579
healthcare organization within the state

305
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,620
of Utah to go through their incident

306
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,240
response processes and things and guess

307
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,800
what there's fine meetings and there's

308
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,420
new information and risk that needs to

309
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,160
be looked at bug bounties we kind of

310
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,720
talked about internal threats and other

311
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,899
things so this is how we find risk we

312
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,519
can look at it all day and we can find

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,860
it right now we need to Define it a

314
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,880
little bit

315
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
I have this favorite quote that my

316
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,079
mentor one of my mentors my current boss

317
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,120
at the Utah education and Telehealth

318
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,220
Network says he says and this will

319
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,660
probably resonate probably with many of

320
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,200
you as technical people we often see the

321
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,540
problem and the solution at the same

322
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,180
time you guys ever have that now it

323
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,920
sounds like just a little cliche to say

324
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,540
it but I'll give some definition and say

325
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,940
we as technical people really have this

326
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,540
problem it is hard for us to focus on

327
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,440
or on problems and issues without

328
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,380
immediately jumping to we got to solve

329
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,160
this

330
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,260
here's the solution and it's not a well

331
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,420
thought out solution it's just a we are

332
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,220
here to solve problems it's built into

333
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,040
our I.T DNA right we are the problem

334
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,779
solver hey my mouse is broken well if

335
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,100
you try it I'm plugging it and plugging

336
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,260
it back in kind of things right where

337
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,880
that might not be the solution but we

338
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,459
offer those so defining risk as we're

339
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,019
going through these processes and

340
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,200
realizing that risk or we identify it

341
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,019
but defining what is that risk of having

342
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,100
to put vpns on every single phone for to

343
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,800
manage email right what are those risks

344
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,959
now we can talk about oh well there's

345
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
this and this and then here's how we

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
solve it or it's important to have time

347
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,720
between Define or identifying and trying

348
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,459
to solve the problem think it through

349
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,380
understand it really well because we

350
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,899
often so quickly move to trying to just

351
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,600
solve the problem rather than in putting

352
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,339
it into a process and this is where we

353
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,399
lose out on a repeatable process that we

354
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,120
can do for all of this okay and so let's

355
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
talk a little bit more about defining

356
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,639
risk before we get into some of this

357
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,019
other stuff

358
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,760
because I want to just give you some key

359
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,560
components that might be helpful and

360
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,880
fill a couple of the gaps that you might

361
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,220
have separate risk from current

362
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,200
compensating controls when you identify

363
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,540
something that creates risk within your

364
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,820
organization separate the compensating

365
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,040
controls from it first think of it as

366
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,620
this is a brand new risk I don't have a

367
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,899
firewall in place I don't have Network

368
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,760
segmentation and I don't have other

369
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,100
compensating controls what risk does

370
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,680
that create in in that mode and then

371
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,600
build those compensating controls that

372
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,120
currently exist back in and then see

373
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,620
where you're at because if you always

374
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,899
just assume that the compensating

375
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,940
controls that you have check all of

376
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,519
these boxes over here without reviewing

377
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,680
them first you're going to lead yourself

378
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,220
into that trap as it were of not having

379
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,760
all of your risk or or sorry not having

380
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,320
all of the compensating controls that

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,899
you think you have up against the risk

382
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,880
that you're trying to assess and and

383
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,459
Define okay real versus hypothetic

384
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,560
hypothetical risk definitions I added

385
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,899
this in here just to make sure that if

386
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,639
again if you're going through this

387
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,220
process often sometimes a hypothetical

388
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,199
discussion with you and a couple of your

389
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,720
other I.T or security colleagues is

390
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
great like you know what if the CEO did

391
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,480
decide to send out his email credentials

392
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,699
to everybody on the planet like what

393
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,079
would that be

394
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,899
but likelihood of something like that

395
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,480
happening I mean I don't know all your C

396
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,060
CEOs or anything but I mean probably low

397
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,820
maybe right but making sure that you

398
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,940
keep risk definition real don't get too

399
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,620
far into the weeds and that's really

400
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,300
what the next slide's about as well but

401
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,940
take the time to think risk through okay

402
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,079
because oftentimes if we just jump from

403
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,540
Define from identifying to trying to

404
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,579
solve the problem we're not thinking hey

405
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,380
you know what that SSH thing that we're

406
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,880
trying to shut up in fact you probably

407
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,560
this will resonate with many of you as

408
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,560
well we just jumped to a solution we

409
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,540
turn off SSH but then guess what happens

410
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,279
tomorrow

411
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,860
some other department comes and says hey

412
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,260
we can't run payroll today well why

413
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,720
can't we run payroll well somebody shut

414
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,360
off SSH on the such and such a thing

415
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,540
right because we didn't understand the

416
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,519
whole risk to the whole the whole thing

417
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,399
so take time think this through in most

418
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,199
cases risk isn't something you have to

419
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,300
just snap your fingers and deal with

420
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,339
immediately at least not if you're doing

421
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,860
it well and doing it right okay

422
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,240
um let's see

423
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,240
um don't just Define a single major risk

424
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,279
and focus on it alone that's the other

425
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,019
part of this this point that I wanted to

426
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,240
make is that it's important to think

427
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,019
outside the box understand the risk

428
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:57,120
holistically rather than just oh vpns

429
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,959
are bad

430
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,360
for phones or whatever and just focus

431
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,540
only on that piece because

432
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,000
it might not be so bad if there's other

433
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,679
components with it anyways moving on the

434
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,959
rabbit hole as I mentioned it's

435
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,059
impossible to fully Define and

436
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,160
understand every piece of every risk

437
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,780
that you have in an organization so

438
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,099
don't try

439
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,980
get close and that's where when we come

440
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,799
later on and we repeat and review and we

441
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,540
monitor that process there's nothing

442
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,959
keeping us from

443
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,040
reassessing this further down the road

444
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,900
let's mitigate the important risk now

445
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,540
and so work to just understand it is

446
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,440
probably the key phrase here okay next a

447
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,260
critical portion of X risk acceptance is

448
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,600
documenting this okay we had to raise

449
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,820
some of your hands before not a lot of

450
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,860
you have formal documentation processes

451
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,460
this is a key component for risk

452
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,940
acceptance okay because if you have all

453
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,380
of the risk

454
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,539
thought through and identified and it's

455
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,679
all up here in cerebrum and nothing gets

456
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,160
documented then how are you I mean I

457
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,660
know memory is fallible but how are you

458
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,400
keeping track of all of that

459
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
what happens is the most recent risk

460
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,059
becomes the thing on top and the thing

461
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,500
that we've learned about a month ago

462
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,840
kind of Falls by the wayside and we if

463
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,340
we're not documenting it and we're not

464
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,320
running it through a process we're going

465
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,419
to forget about it how many of you feel

466
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,580
like within your organization there's

467
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,500
some risk that we've hashed through

468
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,299
we've identified we've talked about it

469
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,280
we've done some things but it never made

470
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,840
it past that stage does anybody feel

471
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,940
like an organization might be there okay

472
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,559
a couple of hands right and that that

473
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,179
would be a very honest answer for many

474
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,280
of us unless you've got our well-defined

475
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,580
risk acceptance process and so

476
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,380
documenting risk this is crucial and all

477
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,059
and it feeds into a couple things here

478
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,080
in a minute

479
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,940
okay so once to find all risk needs to

480
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,799
be a set or all risk needs to be

481
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,140
assessed and should be done that's

482
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
probably me just writing weird things on

483
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,160
a slide uh last minute risk acceptance

484
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,440
forms and processes are a great template

485
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,299
how many of you all have a risk

486
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,500
acceptance

487
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,140
form within your organization that you

488
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,280
go through

489
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,559
to assess risk does anybody have those

490
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,919
okay a few hands okay today if you learn

491
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,100
nothing else from this presentation I

492
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,440
want you to take back and apply into

493
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,480
your culture

494
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,240
I need a risk acceptance form or

495
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,280
template okay and I'm going to show you

496
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,760
a couple uh or one of the ones that we

497
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
are hypothetically used uh by an

498
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
organization I may or may not work for

499
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,620
go ahead

500
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,100
okay that's a great question he's asking

501
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,140
about risk tolerance

502
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,440
versus risk acceptance and if you have a

503
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
tolerance for a certain level of risk

504
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
within an organization you know where do

505
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,500
you require a risk acceptance form

506
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,299
another process to track that to happen

507
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,160
can I defer the answer because I think

508
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm going to answer it later and if not

509
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,400
re-ask the question and let's let's

510
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,900
cover it

511
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,539
um but yeah coming up with a process

512
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,700
that can be repeated even if it's not

513
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,520
the perfect process to begin with is is

514
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,320
a great place to start okay risk needs

515
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,900
to be well documented and undocumented

516
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,760
risk is accepted with or without

517
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,640
justification if if you've talked about

518
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,720
it and it's been one of those things

519
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,000
that oh man I told you guys that we were

520
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
going to get hacked because we left the

521
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,539
SSH Port open on that web server that

522
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,340
was exposed to the world

523
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,559
you know that's a lot of what it Coulda

524
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,299
because it wasn't documented it didn't

525
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,620
go through that full process so let's

526
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,660
keep going let's talk about a risk

527
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,700
acceptance form and give you kind of an

528
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,000
overview this one is very close to one

529
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,440
of the ones that we use at the Utah

530
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,020
education Telehealth Network okay it's

531
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,640
not an exact copy because there's some

532
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,620
more proprietary things

533
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,080
for our specific functions and our

534
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,419
specific processes that I wanted to keep

535
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,940
internal but in essence it's something

536
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,760
just like this we have a form that we

537
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,039
fill out often from the security office

538
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,120
standpoint and when we identify risk so

539
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
uh an employee name this is generally

540
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,740
meant for hey I want to do this new

541
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,059
project

542
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,799
I I need to understand what kind of

543
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,299
security ramifications and other things

544
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,580
come from this and we ask the requester

545
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,980
to fill out some information most of the

546
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,299
time unfortunately as the security

547
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,679
officers like I said they're filling

548
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,700
this out but let's talk about a couple

549
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,380
of things general information which we

550
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,400
don't care about which is pretty

551
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,159
self-explanatory but the first paragraph

552
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,720
thing that they can start typing into

553
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,240
this form is describe the risk requiring

554
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
acceptance okay risk definition risk

555
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
identification this is them or us as

556
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,460
Security Professionals saying Hey listen

557
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,820
Bob from HR wants me to leave SSH open

558
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,500
on the Wayne web server

559
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,059
we keep using that as a great example

560
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,520
because I've had that happen before

561
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
because we need to SCP those files back

562
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,919
and forth we need to do it securely and

563
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,740
things so describe that risk and then

564
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,720
describe the business justification for

565
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
the accept the risk acceptance request

566
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,960
right it seems pretty straightforward

567
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,059
why it doesn't need to be this way well

568
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,919
HR needs to send payroll off to the

569
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,200
third party to do whatever kind of thing

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,419
right and then provide a list of

571
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,580
organization data and services that are

572
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,280
potentially at risk by this request okay

573
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,260
you're allowing them to say well let's

574
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,400
see we're going to be sending our

575
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,980
banking information across this it's

576
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,900
going to be you know personal

577
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
information probably some social

578
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,440
security numbers and some other things

579
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,400
and so it allows them to identify and

580
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,559
and and tell you what some of that data

581
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,299
is some of the times it's us you know

582
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,640
hey we're going to be leaving one of our

583
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,740
front door web servers open to another

584
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,419
Vector of attack that probably shouldn't

585
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,820
exist anyways let's move on so this is

586
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,699
like this either

587
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,880
hey you know that is a great question

588
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,419
and so the answer to that is you could

589
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,539
um what I would say is in fact so for

590
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,220
those of you and for the recording the

591
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,820
question was by documenting a risk does

592
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,740
that create more liability that's

593
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,260
probably the better like for you as an

594
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,780
organization because now it's documented

595
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,700
you knew about it kind of thing right

596
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,440
and how does that impact cyber security

597
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
insurance and all those other things

598
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,679
this is a wonderful question I've got

599
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,480
what I think is an okay answer did you

600
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,260
have something to add to it

601
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,260
now

602
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,260
right

603
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,179
right

604
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,600
I didn't even know about it

605
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,159
yeah

606
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,799
and so David do your to your question

607
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,080
specifically I think that there could be

608
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,179
some interpretation of increased

609
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,220
liability if it's something is

610
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,799
documented and not dealt with meaning if

611
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,419
you're just sitting back as a security

612
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,520
or I.T professional and you're just

613
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,860
churning out risk of sex acceptance

614
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,780
documents

615
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,120
and all it is is definition or

616
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,220
identification definition and kind of

617
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,080
understanding what the risk is and then

618
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,539
it just goes into a box somewhere yeah

619
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,580
you you could create some more liability

620
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,400
for yourselves because this this is part

621
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,679
of that important process and maybe I

622
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,200
mean I might be just kind of supposing a

623
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,520
little bit here but maybe that's the

624
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,559
fear or the risk that we're trying to

625
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,419
avoid when I said hey who documents

626
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,000
their risks and not a lot of hands go up

627
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,919
because if I don't document it then I

628
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,960
can claim ignorance later or maybe

629
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,179
anything else but up here to your point

630
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,580
just like a couple of slides ago whether

631
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,400
you identify it or not it exists

632
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,260
and it's better for you to go through

633
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,280
the process but to avoid the problems of

634
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,140
liability and other things you've got to

635
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,059
carry that process to the end of the row

636
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,820
somebody needs to know about it and

637
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,960
we're going to talk about it here in

638
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,220
fact it's probably one of the next

639
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,159
slides here once you have it

640
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,260
in fact let me defer and some of this is

641
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,280
going to be answered in a couple of

642
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,020
slides here but you've got to come up

643
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,500
with compensating controls to start

644
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,360
mitigating that risk right because if we

645
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,580
just document it and throw it in the bin

646
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,260
document and throw on the bin maybe we

647
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,960
send it as an email up to the C the CTO

648
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,360
or to you know some other executive like

649
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,159
hey found another risk found another

650
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,260
risk but there's no compensating

651
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,240
controls being built and developed to

652
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,740
mitigate that risk then yeah there's

653
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,419
some liability that can come as a result

654
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,340
but I want you to understand in the

655
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,559
security industry compensating controls

656
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,720
are the primary way that we reduce risk

657
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,460
the compensating control is the key term

658
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,980
there and this is anything we put in

659
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,120
place to mitigate the risk or to

660
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,220
mitigate the risk that we create that

661
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,900
needs to be accepted a couple of real

662
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,820
quick examples in our web server SSH

663
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,000
Port thing would be that if we have to

664
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,220
have that open a compensating control

665
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,779
could be something as simple as we put

666
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,960
an access list on the system to only

667
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,620
allow SSH to talk between two approved

668
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,840
hosts that would be a compensating

669
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,880
control right might not be the best

670
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,039
control or the most appropriate control

671
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,840
for that environment but that's a

672
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
compensating control it could also just

673
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,159
be that we have now a policy that we are

674
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,919
going to review the SSH logs on an

675
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,140
hourly basis on our web server that's a

676
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,080
compensating control now one has a lot

677
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,539
more likelihood of being successful than

678
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,340
the other one right

679
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,080
but all of those are compensating

680
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
controls this is how we mitigate risk as

681
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,700
we Cur we understand it and we put a

682
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,200
control in place to mitigate it

683
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,760
sometimes we can mitigate it to zero

684
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,500
oftentimes we leave a little bit of that

685
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,820
risk on the table and remember the

686
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,279
formula up here

687
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,039
unmanaged or unmitigated risk minus

688
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,620
security controls equals accepted risk

689
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,240
at that point and so there is always

690
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,100
going to be a business decision that

691
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,080
needs to be made on how much risk is

692
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,360
tolerated within the organization and

693
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm still going to answer the other half

694
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,539
of that question here let's talk about

695
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,840
how we control risk in this risk

696
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,880
acceptance document here okay this is

697
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,919
pretty simplistic this is part of the

698
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,419
document that I pulled some things out

699
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,820
of but you're welcome to take a photo

700
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,380
it'll be in the slides and other things

701
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,140
but what is your proposed strategy for

702
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,940
mitigating risk okay this is just

703
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,620
continuation so they've identified the

704
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,360
risk they've talked about and they've

705
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,799
defined it and what the impact on

706
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,140
organization data and resources well

707
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,720
what is the requester's proposal for

708
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,919
mitigating this and so you're

709
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,320
automatically putting that person in

710
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,260
that mindset okay you as the user

711
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,880
need to start thinking about what are

712
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,559
the mitigating controls what's the limit

713
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,240
of

714
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,279
that you can see that is the right

715
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,380
approach for this so that it helps

716
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,480
inform the security review later okay

717
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,279
provide a summary of the security

718
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,320
controls that will be implemented by the

719
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,620
request or okay so hey I need to install

720
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,360
VPN on every single phone okay

721
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,700
we're we're going to

722
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,200
well it's probably a bad example because

723
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
everybody thinks that putting vpns on

724
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,000
phones is a good thing right but hey we

725
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,100
need secure email and so the mitigating

726
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,960
control might be hey we are going to

727
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,600
implement VPN on everybody's phone maybe

728
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,340
that's the better way to

729
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,020
to

730
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,279
articulate that so

731
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,240
anyway it's lost my train of thought now

732
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,940
I'm I've gone too many different places

733
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,580
bottom line here is we we go through a

734
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,220
process of understanding and developing

735
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,020
those security controls and

736
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,659
understanding them go ahead

737
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,200
foreign

738
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,740
not yet

739
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,440
you're jumping ahead again

740
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,059
oh that's great let me in fact I'm going

741
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,260
to go through a little bit quicker here

742
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,659
because there is a review process okay

743
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,419
and so once you have the requesters

744
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,559
information and some of these other

745
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,240
things and again this process might not

746
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,980
work 100 for you you might have to come

747
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,600
up with a different approach this one's

748
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,299
working pretty well for us but once

749
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,039
defined and documented and we understand

750
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,899
the impact and the security controls

751
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,279
that are going to be there you need to

752
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,279
be able to convey risk clearly for

753
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,140
acceptance okay and so that kind of

754
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,220
leads to this next part of the form

755
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,020
section two

756
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,059
where we go through a review process and

757
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,320
so this one

758
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,600
gives us a level of risk where the

759
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,299
security department or some other

760
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,559
authoritative individual that has the

761
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,960
responsibility for this role starts

762
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,659
reading through meeting with making

763
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,580
phone calls exchanging emails and

764
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,320
understanding this whole scope we go

765
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,600
through that whole process again and

766
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,220
then these are the likely outcomes that

767
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,960
we've identified within our organization

768
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,279
which is

769
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,960
the risk that you're talking about is

770
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,000
acceptable for us

771
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,520
and it's acceptable with maybe a reduced

772
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,279
scope or it's you know hey everything's

773
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,320
fine we're we're not going to have to do

774
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,960
much this is this is great or acceptable

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
for a temporary period while other

776
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,399
controls are improved meaning like hey

777
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,720
we've got to go back and we've got to

778
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
upgrade firewalls now and we've got to

779
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,200
do all this stuff but we'll put in this

780
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
ACL kind of as a stop Gap measure and

781
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,880
we'll fix these kinds of problems but

782
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,419
there's a an ongoing component to it or

783
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,279
fully acceptable without qualification

784
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,159
meaning that at this point there's it

785
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,419
there's

786
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,340
no there's nothing that needs to be done

787
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,679
or there's a not acceptable meaning that

788
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,240
the residual risk is greater than the

789
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,700
potential business benefit and the risk

790
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,380
acceptance is just flat out denied we're

791
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,299
not going to allow this to happen stamp

792
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,559
right

793
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,200
or something that often happens for us

794
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,140
is that and if I might jump back and say

795
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,419
this is the security director and the

796
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,919
security department within our

797
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,320
organization's approval process this is

798
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,500
me and my role I go through this and I

799
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,880
look at this and there's some things

800
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,860
that I as the security director can say

801
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,620
yeah we're good this is compensated for

802
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,480
we've got good monitoring and management

803
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,919
for this thing that you're trying to do

804
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,200
but there's oftentimes a new initiative

805
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,620
those of you that are are part of the

806
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,720
um education world that understand like

807
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,140
cbrs these are really cool terms anybody

808
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,840
know what cprs is okay only a few of you

809
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
it's not going to translate well but new

810
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,320
initiatives that require all kinds of

811
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,840
new Security review and processes I'll

812
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,820
tell you what when it happens I kick

813
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,100
that thing up to the CTO I'm not the one

814
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,919
that's responsible for saying hey this

815
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,360
entire new Initiative for our

816
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,899
organization and for our business

817
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,279
sits on me and so there is a process to

818
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,600
kind of Kick It Up The Chain does that

819
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,520
make sense and then I'll just kind of

820
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,860
moving move down here I want to talk

821
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,799
just briefly about accepting risk and

822
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,020
who right because I kind of alluded it

823
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
to it and maybe this is part of a

824
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,899
discussion that we can have with the

825
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,700
audience here but what is ex what are

826
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,860
the acceptable levels of risk to be

827
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,140
accepted at the following levels what

828
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,620
risk should the user be able to accept

829
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,600
on their own without having to go up for

830
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
more approval is there any

831
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,919
does anybody have any opinions on that

832
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,620
so at what point does I mean as you

833
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,179
identify a risk

834
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,860
there's some things that the user might

835
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,419
be able to say yeah you know hey it's

836
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,000
okay I'm going to type my password into

837
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,399
that thing fishing or otherwise go ahead

838
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,940
okay so he's saying if they're the

839
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,620
user's the expert in the area or in

840
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,419
charge of their domain right that that

841
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,220
would make sense and so what I see in

842
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,260
this case is a lot of my personal use

843
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,659
not business use and other things I'm

844
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,100
the one that gets to decide what's

845
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,320
acceptable like if I'm going to go put

846
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,539
my personal email credentials into some

847
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,460
weird form because I want to download a

848
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,159
Minecraft Plugin or something that's my

849
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,740
risk to accept right but is that

850
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,020
appropriate for a business related

851
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,779
account on other things right helping to

852
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:07,980
understand the foundation of what I'm

853
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,679
asking here and if we take this

854
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,059
discussion to the end of the row this is

855
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,980
a lot of splitting of hairs and things

856
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,299
in here but what I want you to kind of

857
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,700
get from this is that there are

858
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,279
appropriate risks that can be accepted

859
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,980
at these different levels

860
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,500
but you have to Define in your

861
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,659
organization and that's kind of to bring

862
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,059
this kind of into a conclusion you've

863
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,140
got to figure out within your

864
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,240
organization where your risk tolerance

865
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,179
is to your point like what is the

866
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,580
accepted tolerance of risk we're a low

867
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,960
tolerance we we have high security we

868
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
don't allow people to even change or we

869
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,940
don't even allow people to not change

870
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,159
their password every 90 days and we've

871
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,779
forced two-factor authentication we do

872
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,539
all of the things

873
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,120
with low tolerance right or we have high

874
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,460
tolerance maybe not to throw education

875
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,799
folks under the bus but in in an

876
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,880
education environment when you've got

877
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,140
thousands of students in a school

878
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,640
district and they all need access to

879
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,659
their Chromebooks and everything else

880
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,460
I'll tell you what the username and

881
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,960
password that you're using and sending

882
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,940
out to all those students is not a super

883
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,619
complex one it has to be something that

884
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,599
you can hey student here's your password

885
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,159
again for the fourth time this week

886
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,119
right

887
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,560
kinds of things go ahead

888
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,359
okay and so that's a great question the

889
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,699
question was what example in our

890
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,820
organization do we allow a user to

891
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,500
accept the risk on their own and the

892
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,940
answer is in our organization there

893
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,639
isn't a lot there's almost zero meaning

894
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,859
I I wanted to bring this up in case

895
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,359
somehow it was relevant to some

896
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,980
organization or for your own personal

897
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,500
thing but for our organization it's it's

898
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,359
not acceptable for user to say hey you

899
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,179
know what I'm going to do this funky

900
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,859
thing with my credential

901
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,560
now does it stop them from doing that it

902
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,180
absolutely does not this is we're

903
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,339
fishing and and fishing and some of

904
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,960
these other things occur right this is

905
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,300
the vulnerability at this user making

906
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,599
their decision at their level to accept

907
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,820
some risk okay and sometimes it's not

908
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,960
really clearly defined for them they

909
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
don't know that they're doing this type

910
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,140
of thing and so it's important for us as

911
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,880
it and Security Professionals to help

912
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,040
them recognize these things but it's the

913
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,380
same thing with I.T staff how many of

914
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,119
you guys feel like you would Pat I mean

915
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,000
all of you I.T and and security staff in

916
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,980
here how many of you would pass 100

917
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,099
every single time any phishing attack

918
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:35,099
that comes in and drops into your email

919
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,680
box or onto your phone as a text or

920
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,240
anything else anybody feel confident to

921
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,339
say yeah I'm 100 percent

922
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,859
okay right thank you for not raising

923
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,599
your hands because that's probably an

924
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,359
accurate representation we have our own

925
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,859
vulnerabilities even at our level of

926
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,420
accepting some risks sometimes like oh

927
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,760
you know what I it's just easier for me

928
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,180
to give admin to the Bob over here so we

929
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,380
can install that printer and just get

930
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,520
off my back

931
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,380
and in these domain admin credentials to

932
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,300
do that right and so on and so forth and

933
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,920
so there's different levels the

934
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,380
appropriateness is not definable by me

935
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,900
for you and your organization and that's

936
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,060
the key component here so what I've done

937
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,619
here is I've filled in a couple of gaps

938
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,839
and I said you need a risk acceptance

939
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,480
process and some of that is ubiquitous

940
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
meaning that the math in the free in the

941
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,700
first slides doesn't change you know

942
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,280
accepted risk is a result of all these

943
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,480
other components and compensating

944
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,099
controls and the whole thing all melted

945
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,280
together but risk tolerance as to your

946
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,079
point earlier and Other Things become

947
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,760
part of how you have to Define that

948
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
within your own organization and so the

949
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,500
examples that I put up here of our risk

950
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,200
acceptance process template might be

951
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,000
valid and appropriate for something like

952
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,040
you're doing but it might not even touch

953
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,780
how you need to be doing those types of

954
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,359
things my recommendations are that you

955
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,460
spend the time

956
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,920
to go through and better your security

957
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,400
situation by developing something if you

958
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
don't have a key piece of this within

959
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,780
your organization if you do great in

960
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,640
identifying and defining but not

961
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,040
documenting start with documenting and

962
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,060
then work your way down the list go

963
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,660
ahead one more time

964
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,500
yes

965
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,099
hi

966
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,000
so yeah so for those of you in the back

967
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
that might not and let me

968
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,300
ask the question back just to make sure

969
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,640
I got it so that in the in the position

970
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,119
of you you have security folks that are

971
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,800
going out and they're identifying risks

972
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,359
and other things but if they assess it

973
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,500
as low

974
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,200
as low risk can they just accept it and

975
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
not have to go through the documentation

976
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
process

977
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,040
okay document it within a ticket gotcha

978
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,480
to kick it up or accept it or reject it

979
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
right

980
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,540
right so what I would call that kind of

981
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,460
approach is in an environment where you

982
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,320
need to be a little bit more Nimble and

983
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,780
there's good well-established boundaries

984
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,359
on yes and I one of our I.T security

985
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,599
people can say yes or no to this type of

986
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,400
scenario and that those are understood

987
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,140
then that's an appropriate approach

988
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,760
meaning let's document a ticket Bob

989
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,099
asked for domain admin credentials and I

990
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,300
said no

991
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,760
right it doesn't need to go through a

992
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,920
whole hey should we give it to him and

993
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,839
what's the risk and everything else some

994
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:56,280
of those are going to be obvious right

995
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,859
and so what I would say is that that

996
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,980
would be risk acceptance light having a

997
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,960
streamlined process for the easy to

998
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
derive things is going to be more

999
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,099
beneficial it's going to save you a lot

1000
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,920
of time but those need to have really

1001
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,020
clearly defined boundaries and that's

1002
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,760
the key component to that is you need to

1003
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,099
understand this is where I can't approve

1004
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,619
things versus where I can and really

1005
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,839
understanding that well

1006
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,140
foreign

1007
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,820
anything above like a low level requires

1008
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,859
that process to be completed and that's

1009
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:30,660
an appropriate approach and so where

1010
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,760
those lows and the mediums and the highs

1011
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
for you and your organization are going

1012
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,060
to be different from you and yours and

1013
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,680
so you've got to go figure those things

1014
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,079
out but again my plea and my

1015
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,760
recommendation is figure out where you

1016
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,099
are in the risk acceptance process and

1017
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,960
finish developing that and building it

1018
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,260
out so you've got better opportunity to

1019
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,020
see it understand it communicate it up

1020
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,720
to higher ups and get them to accept it

1021
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
if they need to be the ones to accept it

1022
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,440
and what It ultimately helps you do in

1023
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,980
the end is keep things inventoried and

1024
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,780
understood and get the right people

1025
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,640
accepting that risk because some of it

1026
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,339
is accepted at your level here or here

1027
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,320
depending on where you are but some of

1028
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
it should be the CEO saying you know

1029
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,359
what we're not going to do this or we

1030
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,280
are going to do this because I'm making

1031
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,099
that decision and then it's not on your

1032
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,619
shoulders okay this is that you get to

1033
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,839
lift that burden off your shoulders you

1034
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,780
can be in that I Told You So mode of Hey

1035
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,520
listen I sent you an email about this

1036
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,339
last month before we got compromised

1037
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,740
what I would hope you would do is not

1038
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,099
take that kind of approach as much as

1039
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,740
make sure that it's not on you because

1040
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,720
you didn't document it and you didn't

1041
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,180
know about it or that you didn't follow

1042
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,119
it to the end of the road okay so that's

1043
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,920
really it I've got some other slides and

1044
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,240
other things but

1045
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,760
to to go through more probably burn you

1046
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,040
out any questions that I haven't

1047
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,900
answered that anybody has about risk

1048
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,180
acceptance process he's got a million of

1049
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,099
them up here before I take his anybody

1050
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,040
else first going once twice hey go ahead

1051
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,660
then

1052
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,399
we have this uh yeah

1053
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,220
okay

1054
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,240
okay so before you keep going I'm going

1055
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,500
to kind of for the back of the room

1056
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,119
that's hard to hear so you've got

1057
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,160
processes in place and things and you

1058
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,619
give department heads some ability to

1059
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,020
accept risk and kind of make some of

1060
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,400
these decisions and things but you

1061
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,140
rarely take things to like an executive

1062
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,460
like a CEO or whatever because

1063
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,040
because of lack of high confidence in an

1064
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,720
appropriate judgment level for them it's

1065
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,040
Greek it's SS SWAT or web what kind of

1066
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,280
right okay and so is was there a

1067
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,480
question that I missed or

1068
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,619
okay so the question is are we missing

1069
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,900
something there and what I would say is

1070
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,140
um maybe maybe not I mean if you've got

1071
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,520
a good structure where you've got

1072
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,960
department heads that know what their

1073
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,420
roles are and data stewards for data

1074
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,619
classification that know what their

1075
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,380
roles are and and the approvals for

1076
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,940
Access rights and all these other things

1077
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,859
are well built out then it sounds like

1078
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,180
you've probably got a really good

1079
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,859
environment for risk acceptance and

1080
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,380
monitoring and things and yeah you don't

1081
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,820
necessarily have to take everything to

1082
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,980
the CEO of an organization in fact it's

1083
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,320
very rare in our organization that I'm

1084
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,599
talking to our chief executive about

1085
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,579
these things almost every single thing

1086
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,579
that we do within uetn if I don't feel

1087
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,040
comfortable making the call and and

1088
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,780
that's kind of a subjective thing I feel

1089
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,000
comfortable in making a lot of calls and

1090
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,260
I've got the respect within my

1091
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,660
organization that when I say no

1092
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,760
that they're like okay I get it and

1093
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,980
understand but sometimes yeah I'll have

1094
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,240
to kick it up to the CTO and that's

1095
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,500
about as high as it gets in our

1096
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,540
organization and that seems appropriate

1097
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,180
you need somebody sometimes to say no

1098
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,700
you guys can't do that because they're

1099
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
not listening to me or you know I'm

1100
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,300
trying to have that discussion back and

1101
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,240
forth and so use it to your advantage uh

1102
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,099
where you need to like hey if I need to

1103
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,560
go up to the chief executive up here and

1104
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,240
talk about this and maybe that's what

1105
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,760
we'll have to do and then at that point

1106
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,380
the chief executive might side with the

1107
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,359
person that you're having odds with and

1108
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,859
then it's a business decision it's like

1109
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,599
yes we got to do this I told Bob over

1110
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,280
here that we got to have this system up

1111
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,200
and it's got to be up tonight and and

1112
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,880
you're like well listen we don't have a

1113
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,200
firewall to put in front of the thing

1114
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,839
you know like there's some risk here and

1115
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,640
if it's a business decision then it's a

1116
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,180
business decision

1117
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,359
right I mean again you got it whether he

1118
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,800
says whether the requests come from the

1119
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,440
CEO or not and how it all comes it

1120
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,660
creates politics which we love there's a

1121
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,280
political layer

1122
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,319
in the OSI model that's probably

1123
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,300
resonates with some of you right we all

1124
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,740
know that there's the political layer

1125
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,020
and it does exist okay one more question

1126
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,760
Michael or actually I'll come back to

1127
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,660
YouTube but go ahead

1128
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,720
allow yourself to do

1129
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,660
it

1130
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,579
wasn't that a great keynote this morning

1131
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,980
yeah let me let me illustrate this for a

1132
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,180
lot of you technical people in the room

1133
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,940
local admin

1134
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,740
okay how many of you are all just

1135
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,480
cringing right now by me saying that

1136
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,900
right this is the perfect example of you

1137
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,940
allowing a user

1138
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,839
to make risk judgments of their own

1139
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,160
accord

1140
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,800
because you've allowed them local admin

1141
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,319
on their machine right and it's the bane

1142
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:26,819
of our existence those of us especially

1143
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,740
those of us who work in education where

1144
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,839
every single day there's a new teacher

1145
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,280
that needs a new thing installed on

1146
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,619
their computer to do things and it's

1147
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,420
just easier to say here here's local

1148
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,280
admin get out of my hair I do not want

1149
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,420
to come over there for the fourth time

1150
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,800
this week and install your software for

1151
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,319
you uh kind of thing but that's that's

1152
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,579
an example of kind of what we're talking

1153
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,780
about but you also asked a different

1154
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,579
question or a different component there

1155
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,740
that I want to answer and say user

1156
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,960
education training and other things

1157
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,579
within your organization we saw that

1158
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,920
Jason did an incredible job I was super

1159
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,599
thrilled with his keynote this morning

1160
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,060
where he's talking about having to

1161
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,460
understand and and the the social

1162
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,819
components and and getting good training

1163
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,560
snow did also a good example of

1164
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,200
understanding that 0.5 percent of our

1165
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,119
time as I.T and Security Professionals

1166
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,400
actually goes to training our employees

1167
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,560
what they should be doing and so there

1168
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,420
is risk in us not doing what we're

1169
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,339
supposed to do did I cover what you were

1170
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,099
asking like is that a good response I

1171
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,180
might come back to you if you have

1172
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,260
another minute already come up

1173
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,480
afterwards and I'll because I might have

1174
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,800
forgotten part of your question in the

1175
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,460
back last question

1176
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,319
oh

1177
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,740
that is a great question and I wish I

1178
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,240
just had an oh yeah you just do it like

1179
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,480
this but that adds a whole new dimension

1180
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,859
that many of us are probably facing

1181
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,720
already meaning that what I've presented

1182
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,579
up here is very simplistic compared to

1183
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,339
now I've got multiple clouds that I'm

1184
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,619
living in and what are they doing to

1185
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,480
protect my data and it's a third party

1186
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,940
that we've contracted for for our HR

1187
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,400
System so PeopleSoft has all of our data

1188
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,859
and and all these different things

1189
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:25,440
absolutely that complicates things and

1190
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,859
every time that you are putting so the

1191
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,119
best answer I have for you right now

1192
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,119
quickly and on the spot is anytime that

1193
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,099
you are handing off the responsibility

1194
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,920
of your I.T and your infrastructure to

1195
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,380
somebody else whether that's just to a

1196
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,480
cloud and you still admin it or whether

1197
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,460
that's to a third party that's just

1198
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,280
going to handle it that should always

1199
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,920
have a risk acceptance process that

1200
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,020
accompanies that decision

1201
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,640
should never do something like that

1202
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,800
without a risk acceptance process like

1203
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,560
there is risk that hey that data could

1204
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,839
be compromised from the PeopleSoft side

1205
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,819
throwing people soft under the bus not

1206
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,680
on purpose but that's one that comes to

1207
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,460
mind

1208
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,859
right but they get compromised and our

1209
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,540
data is gone like we have nothing we can

1210
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,800
do about that and there's some risk

1211
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,300
there that needs to be understood and

1212
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,520
accepted uh in doing some of those types

1213
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,680
of things now sometimes it makes it a

1214
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,640
whole lot easier and it's a cost

1215
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,740
decision and all those things Cloud it

1216
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,260
and make it complicated but yes

1217
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,760
I'll just sneaky in go ahead

1218
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,200
they accept something

1219
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,240
right

1220
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,520
did you guys all hear that okay or do I

1221
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,380
need to repeat it

1222
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,780
so what he's saying is Well now I'm

1223
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,460
almost forgot forgotten it was so

1224
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,400
eloquently put but that

1225
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,740
you when you contract with those folks

1226
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,480
and part of that risk acceptance process

1227
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,640
should be that they're contractually

1228
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,160
obligated to be liable for their storage

1229
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,680
of that data and everything else but

1230
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,540
what he's also saying is it's a very

1231
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,240
apropos and appropriate is that even if

1232
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,760
you said 100 of the liability is yours

1233
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,740
that's never going to be true the

1234
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,800
reputation the you know the fact that

1235
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,599
your data is compromised and other

1236
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,240
things will never be a zero liability to

1237
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,460
you and so again there is some risk

1238
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,079
there you're hoping that people's often

1239
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:26,579
those folks are doing a really good job

1240
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,500
uh doing things let me throw out one

1241
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,880
other tidbit I want you to write this

1242
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,319
one down if you're in this situation

1243
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,480
okay if you're thinking about bringing

1244
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,180
on a third party for a service or a

1245
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,619
software as a service and those types of

1246
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,380
things there is a really cool form that

1247
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,300
was developed in higher education that

1248
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,819
you can easily translate over into

1249
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,380
commercial if that's the space that

1250
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,760
you're in I know we still have a lot of

1251
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,980
Educators and education in here but

1252
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,060
write down the term heck that HEC V8

1253
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,140
okay and search that on Google that is

1254
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,300
probably one of the best refined

1255
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,420
checklist item things that you should be

1256
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,280
reviewing for every third party

1257
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,560
engagement now not all that's going to

1258
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,119
translate perfectly for you in all

1259
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,339
situations but it's a great framework to

1260
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,800
work off of if you're doing that it's

1261
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,359
not necessarily part of risk acceptance

1262
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,380
as much as it's risk definition

1263
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,700
and kind of understanding what that

1264
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,619
really means and what should be taken

1265
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,480
care of to make that work so anyways

1266
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,520
I'll end it there

1267
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,079
um because we're at 4 30 and I never

1268
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,720
thought I'd even go this long but it's

1269
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,760
my pleasure to have you here and thank

1270
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,400
you for coming and joining us we'll see

1271
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,260
you either downstairs in a little bit if

1272
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,240
you want to come trade a Yoda or a badge

1273
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,220
for a Yoda badge or I might have some

1274
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,839
other ones in my pockets that I can hand

1275
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,640
out for the mini badges you're welcome

1276
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,020
to come see me I'll be down at the badge

1277
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,180
Life Community Booth probably for the

1278
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,579
next half hour 45 minutes at least but

1279
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:53,660
thank you and have an awesome con

1280
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,870
[Applause]
