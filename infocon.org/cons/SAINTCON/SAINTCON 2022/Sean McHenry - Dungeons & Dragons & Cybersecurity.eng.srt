1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,800
I don't know if anybody's ever used

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,300

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,480
it's uh you can either use the uh the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,340
website up top or you can just use the

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,880
QR code get in and just as we as other

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,679
people kind of come in and we I finished

fifth edition you can have all kinds of

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,480
character type so I just went with the

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,839
basics

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
so we do have a little bit of a Choose

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,059
Your Own Adventure

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,480
today and so if you want to participate

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
would love to have the help in

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,260
determining which direction we're going

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,299
to go throughout our time here

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,360
I gave them the whole slide deck I I

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
doubt we're out we're going to get to

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
all nine of the alignments in our

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
conversation

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,680
and so uh look for that slide deck

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,380
um and so that way

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,659
that way you'll be able to just get some

27
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,560
of the ideas that I had in in in the

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
development of this

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,619
wizard yeah that's not a surprise

30
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,520
most people

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,060
yeah yeah

32
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,860
that that's tip that was typically my

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,460
go-to is the Paladin uh now in my uh

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,520
latter Years of Gaming I use paladinum

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,340
because that's the one I know and I

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,420
don't want to have to try and learn

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,079
something new

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,860
all right

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,239
a lot of what I wanted to kind of talk

40
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,400
about

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,599
anybody who's ever been to any of my

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,180
presentations here knows uh I I don't do

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,560
technical

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,860
uh presentations if you're looking for

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,220
the latest in Python scripting or

46
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,020
what the next cool tool is that's not me

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,819
I'm in Risk Management

48
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,599
and I I affectionately say that I am a

49
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,640
businessman who really understands

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,340
technology and and so that's what I

51
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,200
that's the space that I work in and and

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,459
so we're going to be talking a lot about

53
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,620
you know personality and corporate

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,440
culture and and you know using these

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,340
nine alignments that are outlined in DND

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,099
and some of the ideas of what we can do

57
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,980
to help create the security program

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,000
based on the type of people you're going

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,660
to be working with

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,879
years ago

61
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,620
um and when I say years I'm going to say

62
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,959
we'll just say it's more than two years

63
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,739
I went to school at San Diego State and

64
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,800
and when I was down there I got out of

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,379
class I was heading across campus and I

66
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,000
had a little bit of time so I ducked

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,019
into the uh to take a look at the job

68
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,760
boards and that should tell you it was a

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,040
lot more than two years ago because

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,780
there were index cards on a board

71
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,420
literally and

72
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,879
and so when I walked in you know they

73
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,920
said oh hey we have a company here

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,780
that's doing

75
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,659
interviews right now

76
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,799
and San Diego I was in shorts in a

77
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,799
T-shirt and and I said I I'm not dressed

78
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,060
for an interview oh don't worry about

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,860
they they understand they're on the

80
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,560
college campus just go in and you know

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,540
they won't hold that against you

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,720
so I went in no resume

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,540
looking like a beach bum

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,820
and had a wonderful conversation with a

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,720
gentleman

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,779
and then it got to that

87
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,660
one question if you can describe

88
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,300
yourself in what word what would that

89
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,720
word be

90
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,040
as true as I'm standing here I said

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,820
abnormal

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,919
I'm still waiting for him to call me

93
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,159
back

94
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,280
I

95
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,440
Henry David Thoreau in in one of his

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,199
poems said if you know if if a man is

97
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,419
not keeping Pace with his companions

98
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,520
he's probably hearing the beat of A

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,620
Different Drummer that's the that's

100
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,000
where that you know Martine to the beat

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
of different drummer comes from and

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,040
that's always been me I I don't do well

103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,460
in following the flock whichever

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,080
direction it's going

105
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,820
and so

106
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,780
um

107
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,100
I look at things a little bit

108
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,360
differently

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I I

110
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,199
frustrate people whether they're

111
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
co-workers or

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
people that have in the past reported to

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
me or I know that I've frustrated the

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
managers and bosses

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,780
um

116
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,380
I'm very yeah I I've been told that I

117
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,840
have a cognitive bias

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
in the in that I think I'm right all the

119
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,860
time

120
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,699
and and I I try and tell people I I'm

121
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,620
open to suggestions just as long as you

122
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,139
can prove that I'm wrong good luck and

123
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,699
ultimately

124
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,740
we got to deal with people

125
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,979
and uh you know yeah we work in

126
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,960
cyberspace and and a whole bunch of ones

127
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,820
and zeros but

128
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,600
um I so enjoyed Jason's

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
keynote yesterday

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,979
and as he talked about you know the the

131
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,160
strong strong need of of securing the

132
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,900
human and and you know what can we do to

133
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,960
empower the people that we work with and

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
protect our organization from those that

135
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,979
um are not uh quite as ethical and so

136
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,199
that's the bulk of our conversation

137
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,440
today I do want to give some thanks

138
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840

um you're going to see a lot of images

141
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,780
here as we go about some examples to

142
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,419
kind of help frame the context of what

143
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,979
I'm speaking at so thanks to George

144
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,460
Lucas uh thanks to DC Comics

145
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,259
um I am

146
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,740
a Batman fan I've been a Batman fan for

147
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,440
a long long time and

148
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
um we had the rest of DC comments is

149
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,180
okay but uh thanks to Marvel

150
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,160
of course you know we're going to be

151
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,300
talking about some of the historical

152
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,460
figures and you know you know show me

153
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,500
with alignments

154
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,280
but uh thanks to the Klingons okay

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,180
um

156
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
you know they uh they bring some really

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,819
great technology too for us

158
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,560
okay

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,500
what color is this

160
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,020
how do you know

161
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,699
you looked at it but but how do you know

162
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,180
it's red

163
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,979
because we've been taught that right

164
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,560
okay since

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
you were little right since probably

166
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,300
since most of you were just barely

167
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,880
walking this is red

168
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,139
okay

169
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,199
and it's from that point

170
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,720
when you're taught your primary colors

171
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,340
that

172
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,900
your view and and your your world core

173
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,780
beliefs begin to be formed

174
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,979
okay

175
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,680
and so when we think about the color red

176
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,720
what does red mean

177
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,759
what's that

178
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,120
it does depend on the context okay red

179
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,940
is associated with love and passion and

180
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,879
and strength yeah you know the power

181
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,179
ties what color are they predominantly

182
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,200
red right okay but red is also

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,099
associated with rage and danger

184
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,500
you come up to an intersection what

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
color is the stop sign

186
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,880
for danger

187
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,339
right okay and if it's not a stop sign

188
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,839
and it's a yield what color is that

189
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,320
yield sign

190
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,600
yeah yellow because it's not so much

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,920
danger right

192
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,120
okay

193
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,580
and what's the third one that we use in

194
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,080
our color scheme

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
red yellow and

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,820
green yeah and everybody knows that

197
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,940
because it means something right in in

198
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,680
the culture that we have

199
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
okay

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,019
um

201
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,940
red is assertive

202
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,220
but red is impulsive

203
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,459
red is powerful and confident but it's

204
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,119
also primitive

205
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,620
and so we have the culture of red and

206
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,100
think about what these phrases mean in

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,620
the red versus in the black Finance

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,980
right

209
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,500
red herring

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,459
scene red

211
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,319
o a paint to town red is

212
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,740
no having a party

213
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,800
yeah going out and and let loose okay

214
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,660
red carpet treatment

215
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,000
and of course a red flag

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,760
right so same word

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,540
very very different meaning

218
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,519
based on the context with which you put

219
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,160
that simple phrase in right

220
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,500
okay

221
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,720
okay so it's all about really just the

222
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,120
culture if we take a lot of those

223
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,920
phrases and we were to go to Europe

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,019
maybe it's it's not going to quite mean

225
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,140
the same thing if we go to

226
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,200
um southeast Asia it may not see mean

227
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,420
the same thing okay and so it's really

228
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,540
all driven by by culture now we have the

229
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,339
grander culture

230
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:44,940
um

231
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,399
you know that we've got Utah culture

232
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,700
we've got uh American culture we've got

233
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,620
um you know culture that's derived from

234
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,100
our family's nationalities and so forth

235
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,140
but but in in

236
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,380
the context of of our workplaces there

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,839
there's a business culture

238
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,839
and and that business culture is either

239
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,000
shaped

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,760
or it's created on its own

241
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
okay

242
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,779
within this business

243
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,279
environment you have a lot of different

244
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,200
personalities

245
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,779
some of them are clean and neat

246
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,640
some of them are not so clean and neat

247
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,180
um

248
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,260
some of them are minimalists they they

249
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,660
they they're not there in the office and

250
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,079
and but five o'clock I am gone you know

251
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,940
they have their their computers and

252
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,540
their bags packed at 4 55 because when

253
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,920
five o'clock hits they're out the door

254
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,140
right

255
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,920
um

256
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,620
of course there are some people that

257
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,240
they are there when you show up and

258
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,000
they're there when you leave you know

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
because that's their personality they

260
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
gotta they gotta get in and get that

261
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,279
last thing done right

262
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,440
okay

263
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,660
But ultimately

264
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,279
if we intend to put on the good fight

265
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,339
and be able to face that foe

266
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,339
we really do need

267
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,600
a lot of different talents tools

268
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,540
different approaches viewpoints

269
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,260
that you know yes we should welcome and

270
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,320
open Melting Pot within our corporate

271
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,459
culture

272
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,300
so that way the corporate the

273
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,680
corporation can succeed

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,200
okay so today we're talking about the

275
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,820
alignments

276
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,600
and so it's if if first is there anybody

277
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,240
in here who has not played Dungeons and

278
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,480
Dragons

279
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,279
okay so let me explain about Dungeons

280
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,740
and Dragons role-playing game

281
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
um it was the start of the 1970s uh Gary

282
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,440
gygax and his friends he's the one

283
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
that's kind of credited for the creation

284
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,579
of this I had some friends that helped

285
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,620
to form it and it's fantasy but my son

286
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,480
is actually at University of Utah

287
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,540
studying game design and

288
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,500
almost every game today in in turn play

289
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,560
games uh has some Roots back into

290
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,019
Dungeons and Dragons it was

291
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,420
transformational in the way games are

292
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,680
are done

293
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,740
but within the uh Dungeons and Dragons

294
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,620
World there are nine alignments and

295
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,100
they're derived from law to chaos

296
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,800
good to evil

297
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,079
and somewhere in between

298
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,540
now you can expand that somewhere in

299
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,740
between to all kinds of Shades of Gray

300
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,899
But ultimately it just really kind of

301
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,360
boils down into those nine if you look

302
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,579
at the Matrix okay

303
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,220
so for today's conversation I do want to

304
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,660
actually make sure that we have the same

305
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,180
definition of what lawful Means versus

306
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,300
what chaotic means good versus evil so

307
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,620
for lawful lawful is about

308
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,720
following the rules

309
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
it may be about following the actual law

310
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
it may be about

311
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
conforming to the the policies and

312
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,339
standards of the organization it may be

313
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,720
to some extent the melding of

314
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,440
um ideology with with the group that's

315
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,500
there on the team but ultimately it's

316
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,639
about following the predefined structure

317
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,440
of how we're going to move forward as a

318
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,240
society okay

319
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,880
chaotic is just that

320
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
they do things different

321
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,600
it's all over the map okay I do not want

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,940
to say that chaotic is necessarily

323
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,339
inherently bad

324
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,399
I'm just saying it's not structured

325
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,940
I would say this last point over here

326
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,680
inconsistent is probably the best

327
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,360
definition

328
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,760
okay you don't necessarily yeah

329
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,760
have their own internal set of rules

330
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,079
okay their own set of rules not

331
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,600
necessarily in line with the rules of

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,620
society

333
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,180
that's right okay

334
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,279
and yes you know

335
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,639
good versus evil okay in in our context

336
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,500
today when we talk about good we're

337
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
talking about for the benefit not just

338
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,339
of the corporation as an entity but for

339
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,220
the benefit of the good you know that if

340
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,959
if we do our work

341
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,820
that benefits the corporation that's

342
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,139
going to benefit all the employees

343
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,519
that's going to benefit the customers

344
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,380
that's going to benefit employee

345
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,199
families going to benefit the community

346
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,880
and and that that's what we're talking

347
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,660
about with good okay whereas with evil

348
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,699
and this is self-centered

349
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,600
how when it what's in it for me

350
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,060
and and everything of the decisions all

351
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,959
the work that's put into it is about my

352
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,000
betterment as opposed to the betterment

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,839
of anybody else

354
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,680
okay so here begins our Choose Your Own

355
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,940
Adventure

356
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,759
okay we will go through

357
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,160
um I'll go through a process of kind of

358
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,019
resetting

359
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,339
these

360
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,019
you know so that way we can come back

361
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,720
and and see what's next

362
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
but let me know which alignment do you

363
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,959
want to talk about first

364
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,360
a lot of rabble rousers out there

365
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,500
okay last one okay we'll go chaotic good

366
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,660
first we'll get to come back and maybe

367
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,880
we'll do chaotic evil next but

368
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,539
okay so chaotic good

369
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,120
now again if we go with our

370
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,539
definitions chaotic we're we're going to

371
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,419
do it by either our internal set of

372
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,780
rules or we're just you know we're just

373
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,700
going to plow through head first into

374
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,980
the you know it doesn't matter what kind

375
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,380
of Destruction is left in our wake just

376
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,500
as long as we get the job done okay

377
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,640
so some of our kind of classic chaotic

378
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,100
good good yeah this this is for the

379
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,780
benefit of society the benefit of the

380
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,580
organization the benefit of other people

381
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,020
okay

382
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,980
um

383
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,600
you you can argue on on with me on any

384
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,880
of our superheroes and the alignments of

385
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
them except for Batman

386
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,900
I like Batman so Batman's chaotic good

387
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,700
for me

388
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,740
um anybody know who the historical

389
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,179
figure is

390
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,160
Thomas Jefferson

391
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,620
you know

392
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,460
yeah he really did you know he um but he

393
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,520
he spent an entire life bucking the

394
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,559
system okay

395
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,039
um he he he was the one that really I

396
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,660
mean he had penned the the Declaration

397
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,700
of Independence let's kick the uh the

398
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,740
the king out right

399
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,480
okay and so what what can we do as cyber

400
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
Security Professionals as Risk Managers

401
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,820
in order to develop a good security

402
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,299
program for somebody in the organization

403
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,020
who is chaotic good

404
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,780
here's some thoughts of mine

405
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,379
okay

406
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,980
if we can put in a good framework

407
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,720
for these people

408
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,179
to work in they like to kind of do

409
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,640
things on their own right so let's just

410
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,380
put guard rails up

411
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,080
let them come up with ideas and

412
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,640
solutions

413
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,140
but within some semblance of structure

414
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,360
and and kind of keep them bouncing you

415
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
know the put those guard rails up when

416
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,080
you go bowling you always get a strike

417
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,140
it's that same kind of concept

418
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,240
I say agile

419
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,299
not so much that um

420
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm talking about like an the agile

421
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,620
framework or thing like that but but the

422
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,140
the concept of agile is to shrink things

423
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,059
down to Short

424
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,140
s of of work and so with these type of

425
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,100
people that that are chaotic if we can

426
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,140
shrink their focus

427
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,600
just a little bit then we can get better

428
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,039
work production out them and they're not

429
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,600
going to diverge into something else

430
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,799
right

431
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,559
okay but ultimately even if they do

432
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,539
start getting and bouncing off the walls

433
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,539
they still do have that well we're just

434
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,919
doing it for the better best of the

435
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
company okay

436
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,340
um automate as much as possible and if

437
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,380
we do that then we reduce the amount of

438
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
bouncing around

439
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,020
that uh that these people will do okay

440
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,419
because because again we're trying to

441
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,360
focus their efforts and their energies

442
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,760
and of course good asset management you

443
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,919
know if we know what we have and I'm not

444
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,900
just talking about devices I'm talking

445
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,299
about the software I'm talking about not

446
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,360
just the the cuts type or the SAS type

447
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,600
Solutions but if you do any development

448
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
what type of languages are you using is

449
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,100
everything up to date you know so

450
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,500
understanding truly what your assets are

451
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,440
so that way when when something chaotic

452
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
enters into the environment you can say

453
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,360
well hey what's this okay because with

454
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,100
these type of people something chaotic

455
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,240
will show up

456
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,600
oh I'm sorry let me go back here

457
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,860
oh again previous previous

458
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,240
okay

459
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
so next alignment uh

460
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,080
looks like people uh like good and so

461
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,360
they're moving away from Evil and going

462
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,080
more neutral

463
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,899
maybe I spoke too soon

464
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,419
I gotta tell you what we'll go ahead and

465
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,980
go uh

466
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,659
yeah there's chaotic cable

467
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,240
okay so we'll go ahead and do that one

468
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,080
and

469
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,580
ah it's not like there we go

470
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,940
okay uh chaotic evil

471
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,419
now so you may have noticed wait a

472
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:25,919
minute this is the same guy as the last

473
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,179
one right

474
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,820
uh yeah so this guy shows up on all my

475
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,539
slides okay and and my point in this

476
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,100
is

477
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,620
you you can't necessarily really tell

478
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,419
what type of a personality you're

479
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,580
dealing with by looking at them

480
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,900
okay

481
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,600
um they they could look good smell good

482
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
talk good okay

483
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
um so you you kind of have to get to

484
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,720
know the people that that you work with

485
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,700
okay

486
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,220
but this is our chaotic evil employee

487
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,460
um

488
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,460
quintessential Joker chaotic evil

489
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,080
um it it well so my kids don't know who

490
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
the bottom right guy is uh they're a

491
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,159
little young

492
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,840
anybody know who that is

493
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Charles Manson yeah okay

494
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,880
um you just look at those eyes and just

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,760
I mean as otherworldly right

496
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,260
so chaotic evil the greatest chaotic

497
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,820
evil

498
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,379
in Star Wars

499
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,700
okay so you can see there if you really

500
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,419
truly have this type of person

501
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,460
um get them out

502
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,539
okay uh I I did work at a place

503
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,320
where

504
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
every day was something new

505
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
um he wasn't dangerous he wasn't uh

506
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,460
there wasn't necessarily a risk of you

507
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,860
know active shoot or anything like that

508
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,340
but every day he came in oh the doctor

509
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,140
said this and so therefore you need to

510
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,360
change my workstation to that way and

511
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
and oh this person said there's an oh

512
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,360
and what he was trying to do was he was

513
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,179
trying to get us to

514
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,419
fire him without cause so he can then

515
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,080
file a lawsuit for wrongful termination

516
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,240
and I spent

517
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,600
weeks crawling under his desk unscrewing

518
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,100
the the

519
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,700
um

520
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,539
his cubicle to readjust it because it's

521
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,559
going to be better for him while HR and

522
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,919
management put together a case of why

523
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,960
this guy should be fired

524
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,780
okay so so if you have somebody who's

525
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,179
truly trying to take the company down

526
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,960
what's in it for me and doing all kinds

527
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,200
of things just work with HR on this one

528
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,460
okay

529
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,620
because there's there's not really a

530
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,760
whole lot that you're going to be able

531
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,020
to do in that kind of situation

532
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,200
all right

533
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,539
okay so looks like lawful good is next

534
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,059
right yeah I'll give you a few minutes

535
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,240
I will have to say I am surprised I I

536
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,159
honestly thought that chaotic neutral

537
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,720
would be one of the biggest ones because

538
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,059
everybody likes playing chaotic neutral

539
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,260
because you can just do whatever you

540
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,039
want

541
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,380
but uh

542
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,659
okay looks like we'll go with lawful

543
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,340
evil

544
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,899
oh a few more coming in

545
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,159
hey so some of you said chaotic good you

546
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,419
want to go back and talk about that

547
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,600
again

548
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,620
no okay

549
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,360
all right so lawful evil

550
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,480
sorry give me just a moment let me reset

551
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,799
this

552
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,200
for votes okay so lawful evil

553
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,400
lawful evil are those that have not

554
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,279
necessarily the companies

555
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,740
policies and the law and everything in

556
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,260
place but they definitely have some

557
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,419
structure which was with which they

558
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,380
follow

559
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,900
uh the guy the the comic book character

560
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,220
two face

561
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,380
never made a decision unless he flipped

562
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,460
a coin

563
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,100
so he had a structure that was in place

564
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,860
now the end result was evil

565
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,419
but he he he couldn't deviate from that

566
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,179
structure Okay so

567
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,760
uh of course we got that guy on the

568
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,480
right

569
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,740
um

570
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,740
what do we do about lawful evil people

571
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,080
okay

572
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,600
um now again you know in our definition

573
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,260
of evil I I'm I I want to make sure that

574
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,120
we're thinking these are people who are

575
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,940
in it for themselves okay they're not

576
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,460
mass murderers Charles Manson but

577
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,779
they're they're just in it for

578
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,140
themselves and they will do things for

579
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,539
them over the company even if that means

580
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,880
taking the company down okay

581
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,140
so

582
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,580
uh

583
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,159
lots of audit logs

584
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,960
okay if you've got somebody that's

585
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,320
that's like this audit them I know that

586
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,480
it's going to be system heavy I know

587
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,799
that you're going to impact your

588
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,779
bandwidth and your traffic I know that

589
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,120
you you've got to set up a whole cluster

590
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,159
of servers just to be able to store all

591
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,100
of that for three hours I I get it but

592
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,380
it's it's these audit logs that are

593
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,020
going to help you to focus in on whether

594
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,000
or not anything nefarious is gonna is

595
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,760
happening okay

596
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,059
when I say intentional Access Control

597
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,059
I'm saying these are the people that you

598
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,120
truly give them only the access with

599
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,179
which they need to get their job done

600
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,640
box them in

601
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,940
okay they then then they can't deviate

602
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,460
into

603
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,380
whatever actions they're going to take

604
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,380
to benefit themselves okay

605
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,179
and then good succession planning

606
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,240
because when you

607
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,120
create a structure a lawful structure

608
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,020
that conflicts with theirs

609
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,400
they're going to leave

610
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,940
okay they they they won't enjoy the

611
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,340
environment they will be upset with

612
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,640
anybody who's stopping them from

613
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,860
doing good for the company whatever it

614
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,340
is yeah have a good succession plan in

615
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200
place because when they do leave who's

616
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,419
going to replace them and replace that

617
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,020
effort yeah

618
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,860
thank you

619
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,580
yeah that's a conflict

620
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,740
okay so the question is

621
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,039
um don't we want to exit these people as

622
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,140
fast as we can anyway

623
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,200
yeah you can absolutely take that

624
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,820
take that approach

625
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,539
uh what if

626
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:41,220
okay so my my thought was what if your

627
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,220
lawfully well was the owner

628
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,320
and and

629
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,840
um he does things nefariously for his

630
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,600
own benefit and once somebody comes I I

631
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,840
had one of these once somebody comes and

632
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,640
all of the regulation bodies come in and

633
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,440
start investigating they just declare

634
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
bankruptcy shut the company down to move

635
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,039
on

636
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,700
um

637
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,179
but so yes you know you you can

638
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,860
definitely take that approach find some

639
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,640
way I I look at these people that

640
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,960
um

641
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
when when they're in it for themselves

642
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
they don't want to work very hard to do

643
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,299
it

644
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,880
you know they they're going to

645
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
um if if they find too many roadblocks

646
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,740
for their ability to siphon money off

647
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,320
the top or whatever the case may be uh

648
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,640
they're they're going to bounce

649
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,120
themselves go find easier prey

650
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
um you you can help and encourage them

651
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
along in that

652
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,720
but you know again I want to be careful

653
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,020
in in being clear what our definition of

654
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,899
evil is that

655
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,299
um it's it's not

656
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,039
necessarily

657
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,559
you know what what our society deems as

658
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,960
the word evil and you know Mayhem and

659
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,299
and murder but

660
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,720
um and and and yes we don't want people

661
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,179
who are going to be uh trying to

662
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,700
personally benefit or profit off of the

663
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,880
organization you know you good policies

664
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,340
will help with some of that as well and

665
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,460
and to to give the the

666
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,059
um

667
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,600
the proper book of uh discipline in

668
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,860
order to be able to have rightful

669
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,240
termination

670
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,200
but uh I I it in my view

671
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,740
lawful evil people in in that truly

672
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,899
aren't your your you know death and

673
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,520
destruction and you know choke people

674
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,020
just because they don't agree with you

675
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,399
types

676
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:36,000
um

677
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,820
the the leaf because they don't like the

678
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,000
rigidity of the organization because it

679
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
conflicts

680
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,919
all right who's next

681
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,380
foreign

682
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,659
true neutral

683
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,720
lots of true neutral okay

684
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,600
okay

685
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,279
true neutral

686
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,899
in our

687
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,000
gaming World nobody likes to play

688
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,679
neutral true neutral because nobody

689
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,200
knows what to do with it

690
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,440
um well okay maybe that's not true uh it

691
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,840
takes a special type of player to play a

692
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,439
true neutral

693
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,100
anybody know who that middle

694
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,320
historical figure is

695
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,000
yes yes Machiavelli okay the prince

696
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,260
okay

697
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,340
um

698
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,178
fantastic read

699
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,480
um it's uh it it's old yet this is uh

700
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,419
mid to late 1500s so the language is a

701
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,100
little bit different

702
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,820
um

703
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,580
but it really is a fantastic read on

704
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,419
just leadership style okay

705
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,179
what can we do with our true neutral

706
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,080
people

707
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,360
understanding

708
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,899
yeah they're they're in it for

709
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,179
themselves only so much as or they're in

710
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,860
it for the company only so much as it's

711
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,080
not going to conflict with them

712
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,000
you know these are

713
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,059
um

714
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,100
and and and and I use this word in the

715
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,740
very best sense apathetic you know these

716
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,600
these are your employees who they'll

717
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,279
show up at nine o'clock they'll do their

718
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,620
job don't ask them to stay past five

719
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,460
because they're gonna go home they

720
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,980
um these are not necessarily I need to

721
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,559
have good work-life balance

722
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,460
it's just that work is work home is home

723
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,220
play is play and we we need to have a um

724
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,500
a good structure in that and so they

725
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,899
will do good work for the company and

726
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,520
they will help move the company forward

727
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
so long as it doesn't interfere with

728
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,859
their ability to get out and do other

729
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:23,099
Endeavors that they choose to do okay

730
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,219
but uh doing some patching

731
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,800
you know if if we make sure that you

732
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
know with with these people and and I'm

733
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,760
not saying that patching isn't good for

734
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,480
any of these other alignments uh but

735
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,899
because they they aren't hyper Vigilant

736
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,239
and because they aren't trying to

737
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,879
destroy the company that having good

738
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,800
patching these are the ones that are

739
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,320
more likely to just not be paying

740
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,418
attention and click that email click

741
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,780
click that link in the email okay

742
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,480
um because whatever it was that was

743
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,880
presented to them the it they think at

744
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,880
that moment is going to be the best for

745
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,220
them the company

746
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,720
um their their buddy that's in the

747
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,040
cubicle next to them whatever the case

748
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,780
may be and so if you do really good

749
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,420
patching you're going to put a lot of

750
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,160
good structure in place to protect

751
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,280
against that and again using in the best

752
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,920
sense of the word apathy

753
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,700
uh device configurations again this is

754
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,560
about making sure that the device works

755
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,380
the way you want to not because they are

756
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,480
nefarious or doing anything necessarily

757
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,000
nefarious this is going to help protect

758
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,820
against the oops Factor

759
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,619
okay

760
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,420
and then automation

761
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,240
yeah because they don't have that real

762
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,079
drive and we're gonna we're going to

763
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,240
have better sales this year we're going

764
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,420
to you know help more people this year

765
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,040
that the rest of the organization has

766
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,720
um if you can give them

767
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,820
some automated tools to help them

768
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,740
they're going to be happy because

769
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,900
because it's going to be easier for them

770
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,460
to be able to get out of there at five

771
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,760
o'clock

772
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,119
all right who's next

773
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,339
all right

774
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,260
I was wondering when those dots were

775
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,099
going to swing up there

776
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,020
we have a few more yep

777
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,200
and it's still awful good

778
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,799
okay

779
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,180
lawful good people

780
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,599
lawful good people are not necessarily

781
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,760
prudish

782
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,119
okay

783
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,820
they just have a very strong

784
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,940
moral compass

785
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,900
and they love to have structure to be

786
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,920
able to meet those goals

787
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,480
do I need to ask who the guy on the left

788
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,920
is

789
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,960
okay good

790
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,720
um my 16 year old son as I was kind of

791
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,400
going through this last night he looked

792
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,220
down at our DND character and he said he

793
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,800
doesn't look awful good I don't know I

794
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,760
said Paladin and this is what came up so

795
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
um

796
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,680
that first one

797
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,020
these people who are really truly

798
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,839
and that they're lawful good these are

799
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,300
the ones that uh in in gaming

800
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,400
when people want to play the the chaotic

801
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,780
neutral because they just want to do

802
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,520
whatever they want to do get really

803
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,020
frustrated with those that are playing

804
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,119
lawful good because the lawful good are

805
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,099
always telling them what to do

806
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,760
you can't kill that that Cobalt because

807
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,400
it's just an animal and

808
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,540
um

809
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,320
but if you have a good solid set of

810
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,900
policies and procedures and what needs

811
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,960
to be done these people thrive in that

812
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,460
environment

813
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,099
and they will do it

814
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,760
and they will learn their policies and

815
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,599
and they will police themselves

816
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,599
and and they will encourage those that

817
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,020
are in their circles to do the same

818
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,280
okay

819
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,619
and so if you're clear

820
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,440
okay so you got to be clear

821
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,780
um when I say good metrics

822
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,140
if you get whatever it is that you're

823
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,760
trying to achieve at that time and you

824
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,260
get good metrics and good information

825
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,460
brought and you give it to these people

826
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,980
they will enjoy

827
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,900
okay this is the area that needs to be

828
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,579
worked on and they'll go and they'll

829
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,020
grab and they'll glom onto that and

830
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,400
they'll take those policies and

831
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,900
procedures and they'll work it they'll

832
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,640
give you feedback and say you know if

833
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,500
you change this checklist to say this

834
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,960
then you know and and these these people

835
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,839
will help to support you in your efforts

836
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,680
okay when I say regular team meetings

837
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,020
um because this is you know the the

838
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,820
benefit of the whole

839
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
you know the these are the people that

840
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,980
like being around people okay and that

841
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,359
team meetings don't necessarily have to

842
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,660
be in person if if you have a a large

843
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,660
remote force that that's fine too you

844
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,060
know get on Zoom I mean not even just

845
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,160
for a meeting but you know every you

846
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,839
know every Monday morning everybody gets

847
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,280
on to be able to talk about what they

848
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,079
did over the weekend

849
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,099
Etc

850
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,740
but that camaraderie that Esprit de

851
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,960
corps that comes with it you know these

852
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,920
people really thrive on

853
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,279
all right

854
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,040
we'll let go one more round here see who

855
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,720
wins lawful or chaotic

856
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,700
yeah

857
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,618
looks like chaos is it

858
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,099
okay so our chaotic neutral

859
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,140
I can do whatever I want

860
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,040
okay who's our historical figure

861
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
yeah Blackbeard

862
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,220
okay yeah the uh the great pirate that

863
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,160
that has shown in so many movies

864
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,220
um

865
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,940
of course everybody knows who's on the

866
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,320
left there and

867
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,960
and uh

868
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,820
that young ladies because she looked

869
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,839
chaotic to me

870
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,260
okay so again they're gonna do whatever

871
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,980
it is they're going to do

872
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,520
I

873
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,099
worked at a place

874
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,900
um you know before my current employment

875
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,119
and

876
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,440
um

877
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,700
had a very strong conversation with

878
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,200
the CEO of the organization the manager

879
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,320
of the person the person and myself

880
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,500
or that person was saying you cannot

881
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,240
tell me what to do

882
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,320
I haven't done anything bad

883
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,140
I haven't broken into anything that that

884
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,640
they shouldn't have they haven't stolen

885
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,500
any money they they aren't posting

886
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,260
things on Facebook contrary to the to

887
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,380
the company they haven't broken any laws

888
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,380
and they haven't violated any policy but

889
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,599
they are just you cannot tell me what to

890
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,859
do

891
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:12,300
okay

892
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,460
very very difficult people to work with

893
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,099
when you're trying to especially in the

894
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,740
cyber security in a risk posture trying

895
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,480
to you know protect the overall okay

896
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
um but

897
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,880
if you just are really good about

898
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,920
patching

899
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,000
um

900
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,859
and I'm sorry I can't remember the guy

901
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,780
who's just before me was a Jeff talking

902
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,839
about the endpoint management and how

903
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,820
people hate it

904
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,420
um but a good endpoint management to to

905
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,240
help alert for things that are that go

906
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,760
wrong because these people will go off

907
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,020
the rails

908
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,780
um at a moment's notice I you you might

909
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,820
say in this case gee wouldn't you want

910
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,460
to help move them out as well as quickly

911
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,920
as possible these may be very very

912
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,140
talented people

913
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,140
um

914
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,400
I I years ago I worked at a law firm

915
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,140
that did debt recovery

916
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,900
and

917
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,900
this collection industry

918
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,960
and there was an article in a study that

919
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,740
was done on collectors

920
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,099
and they said that it's very very common

921
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,839
in the collection industry for

922
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:35,240
collectors to be borderline psychotic

923
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,819
what was interesting about this article

924
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,180
is it also said those were your best

925
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,779
collectors

926
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,560
so

927
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,920
do you get rid of psychosis

928
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,960
or do you keep

929
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,839
the The Collection efforts running

930
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,040
smoothly

931
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,720
okay

932
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,960
this is this is where we are okay so

933
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,300
it's it's really a good um having a good

934
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,680
balance

935
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,839
uh you can see that back one robust

936
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,359
backup in recovery because they'll bring

937
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,160
the whole system down

938
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,819
okay so uh test that backup and recovery

939
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,700
process Lots

940
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,040
um make sure that you have good RPO and

941
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,140
RTO defined

942
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,160
okay

943
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,380
and then logging logging logging logging

944
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,119
logging

945
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,680
um

946
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,680
again you can over log yourself

947
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,920
so be very purposeful in what you want

948
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,800
to log against maybe let's just pick our

949
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,540
real critical systems to log on uh

950
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,119
but we do we just want to we we want the

951
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,460
alerts as fast as we can when something

952
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,160
is going off rails so that way we can

953
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,040
kind of rain it back in

954
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,079
all right so

955
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,700
we're kind of getting to the end of time

956
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,540
here

957
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,520
I just want to kind of wrap up a few

958
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,619
things

959
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,359
and then if you want to talk more if you

960
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,560
want to leave I know it's the end of the

961
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,640
day but

962
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,560
uh the ABCs of cyber security

963
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,540
um if you've been in the industry for

964
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,920
a little while

965
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,619
those ideas of what to protect against

966
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,960
they probably seem pretty familiar

967
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,160
okay this is basic cyber hygiene okay

968
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,920
and if you get really really good at

969
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,500
doing the basics you're going to be able

970
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,819
to put in a strong program that's going

971
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,280
to take care of

972
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,920
85 90 percent of the problems that you

973
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,880
may have

974
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,980
okay

975
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,900
um

976
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,780
I like Saint Khan

977
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,839
um I tell all of my family and friends

978
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,480
that aren't technically inclined that

979
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,520
Saint Khan is a really really good way

980
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
to get your geek on

981
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,460
it's fun it's it's not

982
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,520
um

983
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,619
it's not rigid it's it's real you know I

984
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,300
was talking with mad up in the speaker's

985
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,920
lounge and he said it's just really

986
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,079
chill

987
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,200
um

988
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,740
I I like to to to to come up and I like

989
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,480
to present and and I'm in a very small

990
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,220
minority because I don't Talk technical

991
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,560
talks and I talk about people and I talk

992
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,240
about process and I talk about culture

993
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,280
and and I talk about the business side

994
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
of I.T

995
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,579
um

996
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,800
but in Risk Management you know we we uh

997
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,660
right by by show of hands

998
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,099
um because we all want to come work with

999
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,099
you who has all of the resources you

1000
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:42,599
need to take care of all of the

1001
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,640
initiatives that you want to do every

1002
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,200
year

1003
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,240
yeah I didn't think anybody would raise

1004
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,460
their hand we have limited resources and

1005
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,280
we can only do so much with what we have

1006
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,980
and so we can't necessarily protect

1007
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,859
against everything and there's a lot of

1008
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,540
really good things that are happening

1009
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,160
here and

1010
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,560
um I so enjoyed the the conversation we

1011
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,359
had just a couple hours ago in here

1012
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,260
about you know um

1013
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,880
multi-factor authentication and how you

1014
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,859
can get around that and and you know be

1015
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,260
able to protect against that

1016
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,560
and and while it's true and I sustain

1017
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,060
everything that he said and I support

1018
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,180
him I'm behind it and

1019
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,740
what's the likelihood

1020
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,660
is that really where we want to put all

1021
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,520
of our time and efforts and energies as

1022
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,339
to trying to protect against ways that

1023
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:35,579
people can go around or can we put the

1024
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,040
effort into these basics

1025
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,780
yeah

1026
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,720
there are some people internally that

1027
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,099
are going to try and take the company

1028
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,240
down

1029
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,760
or they're going to try and improve

1030
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,900
their lot

1031
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,119
that love to climb that corporate ladder

1032
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,740
and they don't care who they step on to

1033
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,839
get there

1034
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,800
we can help to support the organization

1035
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,020
shape that culture that I'm talking

1036
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,280
about

1037
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,680
so that way everybody is going to have

1038
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,900
some benefit without

1039
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,960
being too

1040
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,380
authoritarian dictatorial in the process

1041
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,740
all right

1042
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,819
huzzah

1043
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:21,599
we're there congratulations adventurers

1044
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,000
you've completed the challenge

1045
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,660
thank you

1046
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:34,560
[Applause]
