1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
nice to see you here I hope I don't put

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,740
you into your after lunch food coma

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,140
we'll we'll see how it goes uh here's a

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,000
little brain teaser to keep you occupied

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,679
during the talk so

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,540
if you've seen it it probably won't keep

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,059
you happy for very long I don't think it

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,139
will be on the hackers challenge

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,580
leaderboard so it's not going to help

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,080
you there

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,480
um but think about that the answer will

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,279
be at the end if you're still here yeah

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,220
okay so our agenda is pretty simple

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,779
we're going to set the stage talking

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,240
about appsec and why it's important and

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,759
why companies need really be thinking

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,559
about application security now

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
especially if they're developing

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,219
products it's very important to them

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,280
so we'll covers a lot of material so I

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,700
apologize for this this is a um uh

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,399
PowerPoint slide bomb I've learned

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,079
earlier today that I need a lot more

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,000
happy kitties or other things like that

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,579
but I did try to put in a couple of uh

26
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,500
cartoons in it to keep you entertained

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,719
and play along on the journey but we'll

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,079
look at what makes an appsec program and

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,579
then specifically look at three things

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,159
which is security Champions threat

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,920
modeling and s-bombs and then there's

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
some appendix material that we're not

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,340
going to look at

34
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,580
but this is the first time that appsec

35
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,280
has featured prominently at St con um

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,860
there are last year I submitted this

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,140
talk and it wasn't accepted this year

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,060
was and there's three other talks that

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,560
you can go to if you're interested in

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,380
application security

41
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,780
first one is uh Kenton McDaniel who is

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
talking tomorrow about application

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,100
security maturity models hope that

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,659
doesn't overlap too much with what I

45
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,159
said

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,920
and then coding secure without becoming

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,680
a hacker is also on Thursday and then on

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
Friday there's a plunge putting the SEC

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,860
back into devsecops so check them out

50
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,600
and there's an absolute Community

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,220
Village down there if you want to try

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,680
your chops at appsec

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,820
yeah

54
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,640
okay this is the obligatory who am I

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,700
slide and this is where I say everything

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,880
I say here is my own opinion does not

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,098
necessarily reflect the opinions of my

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,440
employer or my boss who is in the crowd

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,060
so hopefully I don't get fired by the

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,459
end of the day so

61
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,920
um I am a long time software developer I

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,160
spent a year years a entire career being

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,780
a software engineer before I switched

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,400
over to Security

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,860
I got my first job as a software

66
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,620
engineer before I got my first degree

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,140
and then I slightly over compensated and

68
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,120
went and got a PhD so

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,180
um

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
big long interesting Journey everybody

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,959
takes a different path to security so

72
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,459
you have a different background and that

73
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,140
diverse background is very important to

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,700
have

75
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,739
um I currently work for Arctic Wolf

76
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,900
which has a booth down in the front

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,080
lobby if you do do some

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
I think if you post something on

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,840
LinkedIn you can get a special mini

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,239
badge from them so go check it out

81
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,280
this is my third time presenting at

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,140
saintcon the other two times have been

83
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,000
upstairs doing an introduction to python

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,260
class so

85
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,560
and but that's enough about me now

86
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,660
earlier today somebody mentioned that

87
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,580
executive sponsorship is very important

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,980
so that's a given so this isn't even

89
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,540
before we started the setting the stage

90
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,580
stuff we're instill the front pattern if

91
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,980
you don't have executive support things

92
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,480
are not going to work out so well for

93
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,700
you it is very important and enough said

94
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,800
on that so that's why it says at the

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,659
bottom you can't get it done if you

96
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,800
don't have the buy-in from upper

97
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
management

98
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,680
all right so we're going to set the

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
stage

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,260
who has who has developers on staff

101
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,640
doing stuff now and do you have an

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
abstract program

103
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,080
okay does your abstract program look

104
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,239
something like this security guys tell

105
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,099
developers about specific

106
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,260
vulnerabilities

107
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,239
and then it goes into a black box they

108
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,739
may figure it out they say it's fixed

109
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,239
and it comes back to you

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,060
and then invariably security finds other

111
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,640
flaws and the security guys complain

112
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,959
when a breach happens

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,519
does that sound like security at your

114
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,560
place

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,519
nobody no okay uh it's pretty common

116
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,860
this is actually David rook and

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,019
principles of security development from

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,599
OS Ireland conference

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,738
back in 2009 so things haven't really

120
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,340
changed that much in the 13 years since

121
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,160
he put the slides so I did steal them I

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
hope that's enough a copyright notice

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,100
for it

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,919
most places have a different approach to

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,380
it and that's everything is fine

126
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,560
right we do a little bit we have

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,780
GitHub Advanced security it covers our

128
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,580
bases we're taking care of our

129
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,940
vulnerabilities but that hey it's

130
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,100
skipped a slide that's neat

131
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,860
sweet you guys don't get to see the

132
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,040
everything is fine

133
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,540
the meme of the burning house because

134
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,040
that was there

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
um

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,000
oh there it is everything is fine

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that's how it typically works right but

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,240
is it in the last couple years we've had

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,440
a lot of different things that come

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,680
through yet I've had log for J if you're

141
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,240
a developer that probably ruined a

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
Christmas for you a couple years ago

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,220
um spring for Shell more recently

144
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,680
proxy not shells going around now that's

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,340
a a current one

146
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,960
different types of repository poisoning

147
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,479
is going on we're different uh actors

148
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,240
where their environment activists or

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,259
just people upset with the system or uh

150
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,199
intentionally corrupting GitHub repos

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,180
and injecting vulnerabilities into them

152
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,759
and then there were solar winds anybody

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
heard of solarwinds no it's not not a

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
new thing for you all right

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,740
the interesting thing about solarwinds

156
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,600
is everybody I've talked to about

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
solarwinds I've asked some very specific

158
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
questions about it it's like do you know

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,440
what happened and and what was your

160
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,479
company's response for and there are

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,220
companies and very response was

162
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,240
invariably we patch solarwinds nobody

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,919
ever stopped to think about

164
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,100
if that trusted software that was signed

165
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
by the development process

166
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,020
was

167
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,759
compromised how has that happened and

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
how do we prevent that from happening in

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,900
our own organizations

170
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
right

171
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,620
does anybody know how

172
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,259
solarwinds got compromised

173
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,479
they haven't really said who but I

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,280
believe the password it was a network

175
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,020
compromise of a server with the network

176
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,660
password of password123

177
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
I think I heard that somewhere I don't

178
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,520
have a source to quote that on but they

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,620
got in got on the network compromised

180
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,960
the build server didn't modify the

181
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
source code repository didn't modify

182
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
anything except they installed malware

183
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,720
on the build server

184
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,419
and that malware did a specific thing it

185
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,580
looked for a specific file to be written

186
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,979
on the file system and it overwrote it

187
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,139
and then it just got happily built

188
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,819
there's no evidence

189
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,620
Left Behind after the malware was

190
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,780
removed it was only because a security

191
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,360
researcher noticed suspicious Network

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,660
traffic after it got released

193
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,800
so

194
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,020
you have wife a wife will protect that

195
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,880
right that that's the common theme that

196
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,099
most security conferences for a long

197
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,860
time is you have a laugh right and the

198
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,139
nervous Chuckles from the groups in the

199
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,599
back going yeah no we don't really have

200
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
one yet well they're more common now but

201
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,220
you don't really know how you're going

202
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,360
to

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,199
um

204
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,699
how they're used and every time

205
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,500
something comes up you poke another hole

206
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,960
in it pretty soon it's swiss cheese and

207
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,460
it collapse

208
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,940
so oversight is coming you can see this

209
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,620
coming from compliance Frameworks

210
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,880
governments

211
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,139
uh

212
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,020
and the most important one is executive

213
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,039
order of 14 14028 which came out from

214
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,139
Biden's Administration last year but

215
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,900
there's other ones back in February of

216
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,919
21 there's executive order 1417 which

217
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
instructed people to start improving

218
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,000
their supply chains zero trust reference

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,060
architecture came out from nist

220
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,919
um

221
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,960
and

222
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,240
foreign

223
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
thing coming out from this is the

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,780
minimum definition of an s-bomb we'll be

225
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,280
talking about that one a little bit

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,560
later there's a specific section on that

227
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,379
but it's not just America that has

228
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,660
happened this this slide is all about

229
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,839
American forcing America forcing

230
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,080
improved software security this one is

231
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,240
different countries doing the same thing

232
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,419
so Great Britain Germany

233
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,760
um the European Union as a whole and

234
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,800
then the EUR the trade and Technology

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,740
Council has been put in place all of

236
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,779
them are working on different things to

237
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,540
help make sure that application security

238
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,000
is a forerunner and um

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,279
and thoughts and contracts for

240
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,560
government organizations and selling

241
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,839
software is what we do selling software

242
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,800
to

243
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,620
governments is always looked after by

244
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,380
your uh sales team so if you can't

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,880
support them by having the processes

246
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
that will be made you'll be missing that

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,899
opportunity and one of your competitors

248
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,820
will have that opportunity

249
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,500
yeah

250
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,420
you typically come into a lot of

251
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,220
different reasons or excuses for why um

252
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,620
software security can't be built in now

253
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,080
and those really come into a lot of

254
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,339
different things it's good enough for

255
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,300
now

256
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,640
these risks are not relevant it's not

257
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,980
the number one priority

258
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,620
it's it's just a pilot project that ends

259
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,899
up invariably being in production we're

260
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,000
changing too fast your controls will

261
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
slow us down we depend on third-party

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,459
Solutions we don't want rigid we're

263
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,339
agile we can't do it

264
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,500
uh other challenges is there's so many

265
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,959
Frameworks out there there's the new CSF

266
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,040
there's ISO 27001 their CIS

267
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,279
uh controls which is the top 20.

268
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,380
anybody familiar with this well it's 18

269
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,180
now and when they revised it anybody

270
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,640
familiar with the CIS controls there's

271
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,560
one section in there that's about that

272
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,019
long about application security and

273
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,160
you're supposed to cover everything in

274
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,019
it so

275
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,920
um

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,080
and the other option is there's lack of

277
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,060
developer team buy-in you have

278
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,440
a team that is responsible for

279
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
delivering features and you have another

280
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,820
team that telling them that they need to

281
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,519
slow down that they need to be careful

282
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
that they need to think and engineer the

283
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,800
solutions that they have that that's a

284
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,360
different rant I have of whether or not

285
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,920
your organization calls somebody a

286
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,420
developer or program or an engineer

287
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,519
those all have three distinct meanings

288
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,779
to me so

289
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,940
we want to have software engineers and

290
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,920
Engineering is a

291
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,519
process that is rigid and followed

292
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,740
it can be fast but you have to have a

293
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,360
process and it has to has to be

294
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,040
repeatable

295
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,079
and most of the features that the

296
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,940
development teams are already working on

297
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,240
oh they're they're probably behind

298
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,920
schedule because they're optimistic when

299
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,019
they make the big guesses about how long

300
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,279
something will take and when they start

301
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,839
to break it down they realize it's a lot

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,380
more complex so you have times

303
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,320
now some days if you're doing abstic

304
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,079
it's going to feel like this

305
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,720
but here's my question for you who did I

306
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,760
who do you think I see as the

307
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,899
application security team

308
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,240
agent Smith

309
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,420
okay because that's what

310
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,040
engineering thinks that they're Neo so

311
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,620
you have to fill the role of agent Smith

312
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,459
so okay keep that in mind

313
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,899
it's a matter of perspective security

314
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,000
team members are going to think yes I'm

315
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,220
doing the right thing but you are seen

316
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,860
as an impediment to Neo accomplishing

317
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,240
his mission

318
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,779
now there I can go at osm about

319
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,880
different reasons why this is needed so

320
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
there's headlines all the time that that

321
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,160
you can see

322
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,779
uh most of these repeat the things we've

323
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,760
already talked about but

324
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,459
um mobile Trojans being distributed by

325
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,480
mods

326
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,519
app developers are increasingly targeted

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,760
by slackcan devops tools so

328
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,940
that the attackers have learned that

329
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,040
there is a nice

330
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,320
soft underbelly out of the hard shell

331
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
that most I.T security systems put in

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
place and if you get in you can have

333
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,399
practically free range

334
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,440
because if you think about it when your

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,140
network security team is prioritizing

336
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,240
what work they are going to do

337
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,000
do they prioritize a server

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,440
or a developer's laptop

339
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
they prioritize the server right because

340
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,380
that's what makes the money

341
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,240
but if they compromise a developer's

342
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,540
laptop and that laptop has shes SSH Keys

343
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,760
into AWS or whatever other system that

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,779
they have

345
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,320
that's a low criticality system that

346
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,060
might not have as much rigid controls on

347
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,199
it as you might need to have

348
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,079
some more my popular one is popular iot

349
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,700
cameras need patching to fend off

350
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,519
catastrophic attacks that's like right

351
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,959
up there with the killer light bulbs

352
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,519
that you you've heard about recently in

353
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,839
the news so

354
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,899
um

355
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,399
so

356
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,600
if we take a look at the top 20

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,160
um

358
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,700
actively exploited items that exist in

359
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,300
2021 you can see that about 25 percent

360
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,680
of them

361
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,500
are related to application security

362
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,120
there's the log for J that one's going

363
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,500
to be up there for years

364
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,139
um somebody stated that it would take

365
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,540
decades for that to be truly remediated

366
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,339
but I can't think of another company

367
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,680
that has has not come out and said oh

368
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,420
we're not affected by it we passed it

369
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,560
we're good

370
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,600
there is way too much Java code out

371
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,399
there for that to be true because we

372
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,620
have software that has had defects for

373
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,660
decades that is still not being taken

374
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,980
care of

375
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,320
um then there's the other question if on

376
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,399
day one

377
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,380
somebody says they're not effective for

378
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,839
for log4j it says

379
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
yeah great they're not using for log4j

380
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,760
but what about solarwinds oh we're not

381
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,680
affected by it does that mean

382
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,320
they don't have solarwinds or they have

383
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
solarwinds and it was running an even

384
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,639
older version of it so they're not even

385
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,079
they don't even have a good patch

386
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,839
management strategy in place so

387
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,500
um so log4j GitHub vulnerabilities

388
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,199
elastic and vulnerabilities a couple of

389
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,120
them were at last in sitecore which is a

390
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,579
marketing website management system and

391
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,100
the Apache httpsover all have had

392
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,959
critical attacks that have known

393
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,540
exploits that are really easy to script

394
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,420
so script kitties can do it too

395
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,699
here

396
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,880
um so I think we've clearly demonstrated

397
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
the need for application Security in an

398
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120
organization

399
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,699
but let's think about how it gets rolled

400
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,680
out there's basically four phrases the

401
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,380
phases that this happens in uh the

402
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,860
reactive a Baseline and expanded

403
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,800
an advanced one the reactive one is what

404
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,019
really happens when you first decide hey

405
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,940
we're going to have an aptech team and

406
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,320
that's you start hearing about

407
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,940
vulnerabilities

408
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,399
and you take them to the security team

409
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,320
we're at a baseline is okay we're

410
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,579
starting to get a little bit of handle

411
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,560
of this maybe we'll roll out some tools

412
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,079
we'll start defining our processes we'll

413
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,959
work on it but everything is building up

414
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,000
to having an advanced area and

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
Advanced capabilities in it where you're

416
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,180
proactively seeking and searching for

417
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,279
them and that is through whatever means

418
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,940
you have whether it's pen testing uh

419
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,019
unit tests misuse abuse cases internal

420
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,980
testing QA writing requirements up front

421
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,740
and that's your ultimate goal

422
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,220
but what is the appsex team's role in

423
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,199
application security I've already hit on

424
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,339
it it's not what you think

425
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,079
it's not about you it's about them

426
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,279
Your Role is to build trust simply put

427
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,320
just spell trust

428
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,959
with the development teams

429
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,139
and you need to make it so that it looks

430
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:28,860
like

431
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,740
a unifying effort so here you see a fire

432
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,959
support team where there is person in

433
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,600
the trench with the developer providing

434
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,240
active support form okay

435
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,620
all right

436
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,620
if you look at the devsec on the SEC Ops

437
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
model you can see that it's pretty easy

438
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,240
it says Dev QA Ops and in the middle

439
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
it's devops

440
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,720
been a trend lately to calling that

441
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
devsecops so that that's a good nod

442
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,820
that's security is becoming important

443
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,279
but

444
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,100
the devops aficionalities will say it's

445
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,480
always been there it's always been in

446
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,099
the manifesto there's a little teeny

447
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,559
font that says Security in it so it's a

448
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,540
team sport you're part of the team you

449
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,640
need to integrate into this devsecops

450
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,260
model because that's how software is

451
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,059
done you're not going to be able to

452
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,559
change that you need to work in that

453
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,400
model

454
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,919
so it's like a team sport and a team

455
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,660
sport I did not know much about

456
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,400
was

457
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,699
rugby right I did not know they had so

458
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,319
many positions and I don't know why I

459
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,880
can't see my notes but so we're going to

460
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,260
be winging this because I still don't

461
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,120
know all these positions

462
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,980
um but there are different different

463
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,720
positions that they have they are highly

464
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,419
specified specialized and that's the

465
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,039
main point of the slide is you have

466
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,460
props hookers locks flinkers the number

467
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,260
eight man who is like the center in

468
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,880
soccer you have quarterbacks who is

469
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
their star from American football

470
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,360
Wingers centers and fullbacks each of

471
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
them have a specific role and that role

472
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
is very specific to what they do

473
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,419
and

474
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,720
when the development team says we have a

475
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,340
handle on security

476
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,700
what specialization does that have

477
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,960
right

478
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
we can take care of security because

479
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
we're already taking care of all the

480
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,240
other abilities we're talking about

481
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,400
reliability sustainability uh resilience

482
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,799
but unless they staff for it and they

483
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,600
have people that are dedicated and have

484
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,360
time for it they can't stay on top of

485
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,460
all the changing that is going on it's

486
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,460
just not possible for them to do that

487
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,919
and if you look at the structure of most

488
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,900
development teams here's a sample of

489
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,640
some that I

490
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,400
pulled off of the internet while I Was

491
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,020
preparing for this

492
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,000
this is your standard application

493
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,280
security or your standard development

494
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,840
team where is Security in this model

495
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,039
here's another one

496
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,679
where is Security in this model

497
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,240
a third

498
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,980
no security

499
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,580
a fourth no security

500
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,620
a fifth

501
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,140
no security

502
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,480
and a sixth

503
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,700
no security

504
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,559
so development teams aren't Staffing for

505
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
this so they can't take it on they don't

506
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,580
know how to do it

507
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,440
so

508
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,900
so as we already said development

509
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,760
developers already have a lot to

510
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,559
remember it's impossible for them to

511
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,140
keep track of this would you rather have

512
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,539
a cardiac surgeon operate on your heart

513
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,260
or your GP

514
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,418
okay

515
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,539
um

516
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,000
also internally if you're making

517
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,220
decisions about yourself your opinion is

518
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
going to be biased you're going to think

519
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,700
you're doing better this happens even on

520
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,320
security teams security teams might

521
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
think that oh our processes are good

522
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,220
enough we're catching it we have a good

523
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,539
enough development

524
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm sure solarwinds thought that that

525
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,280
but they had the Pearl Harbor of attack

526
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,559
so the the somebody was thinking out of

527
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,000
the box and figured out a way to get

528
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,760
past them

529
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,860
all right and then if you look at your

530
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,900
Dev Ops models

531
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,940
who has the devops teams that actually

532
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,160
have minimized rights

533
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,320
or do all developers because they're all

534
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,660
devops all have rights

535
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,340
so even though you have a devops model

536
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,120
your your authentication method really

537
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,520
looks like this your authorization roles

538
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,860
is an overlapping developers can do

539
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,780
everything everywhere which means that

540
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,360
it's really critical for them to have it

541
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,400
have

542
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,299
lockdown computers and have plans for

543
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,980
addressing that and they need to know

544
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,220
limited rights type manner so

545
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,679
to get it right

546
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,360
it's it's getting back to the basics

547
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,860
it's getting back to the fundamentals

548
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,360
making sure that you have better

549
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,220
workflow if you have an app set program

550
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,740
and you have employed it right it makes

551
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,660
it so that you have the ability to have

552
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,400
better workflows better remediation

553
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
better overall management but

554
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,580
and safer products better reputation

555
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,260
higher qualities

556
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,360
which might mean less cost because

557
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,299
you're not paying out afterwards

558
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,120
seamless collaboration among teams

559
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,820
so that I haven't quite seen I've seen

560
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,320
collaboration among teams still working

561
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,020
on the seamless part it's a love-hate

562
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
relationship

563
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,440
um

564
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,940
um going back to the higher quality

565
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,860
results for Less cause

566
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,960
I I can't remember who said it but I

567
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,240
heard somebody say once that the

568
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,580
difference between a pin test and a

569
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,039
breach is only when you negotiate the

570
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,179
cost

571
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,080
right so

572
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,940
all right so this is the part that will

573
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,260
bore you to death we're going to talk

574
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,419
about a lot of different Frameworks that

575
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,299
exist out there and you can see

576
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,280
where you might have to start if you're

577
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,260
building it up from scratch or what

578
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,820
resources you might have that will be

579
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,039
useful for you if

580
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,380
you already have something in place on

581
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,760
coming into thinking about which

582
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,320
controls that you might have to put into

583
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
place

584
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,460
the first one the easiest one to start

585
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,460
with is Microsoft has their secure

586
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,700
development lifecycle website there is

587
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,460
lots of material out in there

588
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,659
depending on how close you've looked

589
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,940
maybe you've discovered the Microsoft

590
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,100
STL portion of that but a couple clicks

591
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,480
on this you can see that they have an

592
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,580
operational security architecture and a

593
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,039
secure devops and if you dig really

594
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,140
close they even have some content on how

595
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,080
to do Agile sdl within their within

596
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,480
their organization

597
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,100
the Microsoft security development life

598
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,620
cycle has 12 simple things that you can

599
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,179
do to get started

600
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,880
number one is provide training

601
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,400
in all Microsoft Frameworks number one

602
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,260
is provide training

603
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,919
now that's a little bit of an edgy topic

604
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,860
because I can't think of any place that

605
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,799
has actual good training I see plenty of

606
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,380
things that have awareness but nothing

607
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,419
that actually develop tells the

608
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,880
developer how to code securely and

609
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,559
anything that's done ad hoc in-house

610
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,140
usually is done with the security

611
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,539
engineer in mind where they say hey if

612
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,980
you don't do this you have a

613
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,600
SQL injection or something like that and

614
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,460
they talk about it in terms and

615
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,220
terminology that is familiar to the

616
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,100
security engineer not in terms that the

617
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,960
engine the software engineer will work

618
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,940
on so

619
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,840
um

620
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,940
defining security we're not going to go

621
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,320
through all of them we're just going to

622
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,880
bear with me we're just going to go

623
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,980
through this one pretty quick to find

624
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,980
security requirements that's important

625
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,140
everything that you do after the

626
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,900
developer is done is reactive so by

627
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,700
having security requirements you're

628
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,460
doing things up front you're working to

629
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,440
address the problems when it has a lower

630
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,380
cost when it is easier to fix

631
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,080
and before the developers considered

632
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,020
themselves done okay

633
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,880
all businesses run on metrics and

634
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
compliance reporting so you have to have

635
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,260
kpis to go with it performing threat

636
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,020
modeling is one of the tenants you saw

637
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,640
that as one of the three things that I

638
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,740
signal that will talk more about and

639
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,659
that's because threat modeling

640
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,480
allows the developers to start talking

641
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,400
about the designs that they have and

642
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,740
gives a form for the software and the

643
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,600
application security engineers and the

644
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,059
software Engineers to collaborate in a

645
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,919
freeform space and there are ways to do

646
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,039
it that are not formal that are engaging

647
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,440
and make it a lot less painful process

648
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,059
okay

649
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,080
um

650
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,419
design requirements goes kind of hand in

651
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,220
hand with the security requirements

652
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,100
putting them up front

653
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,559
make sure your company has

654
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,020
cryptography standards and using them

655
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,760
number seven is an important one is

656
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,200
managing

657
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,539
the security risk of third-party

658
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,380
components that's all why there's news

659
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,960
or talk about s-bombs or third-party

660
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,679
compromises and then use approved tools

661
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,419
how many places have dedicated Ides that

662
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,700
they use or is it anything that they

663
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,559
want to use or how do you control even

664
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,600
what gets put onto a server how do you

665
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,120
harden your image and then SAS Das

666
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,580
penetration testing and establish an

667
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,679
incident response process

668
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,480
you might not have to establish an

669
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,520
incident response process because most

670
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,200
places already have one

671
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
and you just need to figure out how to

672
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,100
interface with it effectively right

673
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,380
so we'll start going through these a

674
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,299
little bit faster on the other side they

675
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,860
have the operational security Assurance

676
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,220
which if you think about it it's with a

677
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,740
Dev Ops or devsecops everything's coming

678
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,480
together and developers are doing more

679
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,039
so you have to think about the coding

680
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,960
aspects you have to think about the

681
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,900
hosting aspects and you have to make

682
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,520
sure that you address all of that in

683
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,820
your application security program so on

684
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,440
the operational side they're looking

685
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,140
about how how the controls are put in

686
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,120
place for authentication how least

687
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,559
privileged and this isn't in the

688
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,179
application you're writing this isn't

689
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,440
the software that you're hosting or

690
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,900
running making sure that you have your

691
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,480
WAFF your rasp your I asked and if you

692
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,740
don't know what any of those tools are I

693
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,940
can tell you tell you what those are

694
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,340
later but protecting against DDOS

695
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,720
attacks and making sure that you have

696
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,640
hardened configurations and again

697
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
perform penetration testing because

698
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,120
that's still the number one way to find

699
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,460
out how you're going to get attacked is

700
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,679
to try it again

701
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,260
Microsoft has a framework for trying to

702
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,779
manage your supply chain

703
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,260
number three is the most important thing

704
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,200
and that is inventory does your company

705
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,620
have an asset inventory system

706
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,480
okay I don't see any hand so that's just

707
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,360
scary so okay

708
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,820
okay all right so I can't even ask the

709
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,320
follow-ons to that because I didn't see

710
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,080
any hands but does that asset inventory

711
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,820
go down into the containers that are

712
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,620
running does that do you know what

713
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,179
software is running on that container

714
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,820
which team owns that software and where

715
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,740
to find that software in your source

716
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,779
code Version Control System

717
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,400
yeah

718
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,240
and then more secure devops stuff so and

719
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,260
that's where they start talking about

720
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,419
software composition analysis and

721
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,820
protecting so it all ties together

722
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,799
there is another company out there that

723
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,020
exists it's called uh well I don't want

724
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,400
to say the name of the company but they

725
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,500
have a product called bsim and that

726
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,240
stands for build security and maturity

727
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,640
model I'm sure if you Google that the

728
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,580
company name will pop up really quickly

729
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,080
um

730
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,620
they do a report every year on the

731
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,480
controls that make the most sense and

732
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,299
their controls are broken down into

733
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,880
governance intelligence ssdl touch

734
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,900
points and development and each of those

735
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,700
controls have

736
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,740
three different sections so governance

737
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,900
has strategy and metrics compliance and

738
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,940
policy and training

739
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,059
and then I you can read that I'm not

740
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,200
going to do it for you so

741
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,820
the most important thing from there is

742
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,260
they also say what their top 10

743
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,840
activities are so if you start looking

744
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,080
at the items that they have they're

745
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,559
leaning heavily on things that security

746
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,340
teams do well already so the number 10

747
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,679
thing and

748
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,659
really wish I could see my notes which

749
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,620
gave me the percentages

750
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,220
um

751
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,980
is translate compliance this was done

752
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,260
about 79 of the time

753
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,539
integrate and deliver security features

754
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,860
that's actually good because that's

755
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,659
talking about building features into

756
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,520
your products

757
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,620
um if I recall correctly that was 82

758
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,900
percent of the time integrate and

759
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,700
deliver security fee that's what I just

760
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,980
did use automated tool code reviewed

761
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,419
tools that's when you roll out your SAS

762
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,120
tools and all the SAS tool is is a tool

763
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,039
that automates the process that code

764
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,500
reviews accomplishes it's best done

765
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,380
inside of an IDE while the developers

766
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,600
are working a lot of companies choose to

767
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,340
implement this as a step in their build

768
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,919
process where they will on a pull

769
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,080
request reject something

770
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,940
but that's after the developer may

771
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,559
consider themselves done

772
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,039
or what scares me more is they rely on

773
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,419
the pull request to tell them that

774
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,279
they're not done because that doesn't

775
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,460
sound like engineering to me

776
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,600
it's like oh well let's see if this

777
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,279
works

778
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,299
which

779
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,460
um it's kind of like back when I was in

780
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,960
college which was a really really long

781
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,820
time ago slightly after they got light

782
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,360
bulbs so I would go work and submit a

783
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,640
program on a mini computer

784
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,120
submit it to compile go eat lunch

785
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,799
play a couple video games in the

786
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,960
cafeteria come back and see if the

787
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,179
compile was done and find out that I

788
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,120
forgot a semicolon on line 37.

789
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,700
so it's not an effective use of time

790
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,279
perform Edge boundary testing in QA

791
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,679
if your team if your development team

792
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,240
happens to have a QA Department that's

793
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,320
great

794
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,080
most devcops teams I know have gotten

795
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,760
rid of QA because the developers are

796
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,679
responsible for the security

797
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,480
which means that they are very good at

798
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
testing the happy path for their stuff

799
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,799
and not very good at thinking about the

800
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,260
bad path or in particular the evil path

801
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,640
um Security review features get extra

802
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,580
eyes on it that's always a good concept

803
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,159
external penetration testing that's an

804
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,039
important one why external

805
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,080
that's because external brings a fresh

806
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,539
set of eyes as well internal you start

807
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,980
testing the same things

808
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
and we like to change the pin tester

809
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,779
that we use because if you use the same

810
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,640
one year over year they're probably not

811
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,320
going to find anything especially if you

812
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,740
get the same guy in the engagement

813
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,600
again interface with

814
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,120
um incident response I think we're in

815
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,240
the uh high 80s now I think 87 for this

816
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,600
one 87 of companies here

817
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,720
um engage in this activity and then I

818
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,820
didn't identity identify privacy

819
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,919
obligations this obviously comes from

820
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,720
Global businesses wanting to support

821
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,179
gdpr or any of the other privacy

822
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,559
Frameworks out there

823
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,360
and then the things that we're really

824
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,179
good at is ensure you have the CIS

825
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,919
controls in place because we've been

826
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,620
doing that for decades

827
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,140
and Implement security checkpoints

828
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,419
and Associated government so we're

829
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,159
pretty good at saying hey we need to

830
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,779
stop stuff because our GRC Department

831
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,539
says a but we aren't good at practicing

832
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,799
ourselves and making sure that we have

833
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,100
checks and that are aren't required okay

834
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,059
um

835
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,940
that one's only 90 of the time

836
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,760
the only one thing that happens in visa

837
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,899
from all 100 uh that happens 100 in time

838
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,299
and the 113 people that participate in

839
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,520
the survey every year is that they have

840
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,260
an application security team instead of

841
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,419
putting it off on engineering

842
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,500
okay

843
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,960
there's another framework this is open

844
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,700
Sam that comes from the uh well it

845
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,640
doesn't come from it but OAS has taken

846
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,260
it up and it's now an OAS Flagship

847
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,720
project it's designed in a similar

848
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,940
manner actually if you look at the

849
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,039
history of it Beeson went this way and

850
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,799
oh Sam went that way so they have

851
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,020
different controls underneath underneath

852
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,000
it but it breaks it down into governance

853
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,080
practices

854
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,020
design practices

855
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,640
implementation practices

856
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,880
and verification practices okay oops and

857
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,740
operations put the and in there in the

858
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,120
wrong place

859
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,700
um more recently there's

860
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,039
SP

861
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,299
800-218. now anybody that's gone out

862
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,039
after fedrap is probably familiar with

863
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,500
SP 800-53

864
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,840
because that's the Big 4 400 page

865
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,779
document with all the wonderful controls

866
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,580
that you have to have but this is what

867
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,200
came out in response to Biden's

868
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,419
executive well it existed before but it

869
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,659
can be used to address the the

870
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:55,620
um

871
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,559
the control uh if you're pursuing fedrap

872
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
again have to understand that you have

873
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,899
to start considering State ramp

874
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,059
or well I think it's going away but

875
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,460
there's Texas ramp too or text ramp so

876
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,320
that's going to fall back down in state

877
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,539
Ram so that's the logos for all of them

878
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:16,740
you can be uh ready

879
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,200
provisional or

880
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
what's that last one authorized under

881
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,380
that one

882
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,100
um

883
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,220
so under nist and that really does not

884
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,500
work good on the screen I apologize for

885
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
that

886
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,260
um it's prepared the organization

887
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,019
protect the the software produce well

888
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,179
secured software and respond to

889
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,220
vulnerability so it's it's nice easy

890
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,559
practice these are all easy to Google

891
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,159
but a similar type controls that you've

892
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,659
seen from the other ones so we won't

893
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,299
spend too much time on them

894
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,360
um

895
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,360
and then if you happen to take credit

896
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,340
cards there's PCI

897
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,120
DSS

898
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,860
which has some controls that are very

899
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,960
similar to it like build and maintain a

900
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,059
secure network protect account data

901
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,199
build a maintain a vulnerability program

902
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,399
the interesting thing about PCI DSS is

903
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,440
it says you have to secure the data and

904
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,639
Transit

905
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,800
if it's over a public network so if it's

906
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,379
on a private Network they don't care

907
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,839
I think that's wrong

908
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:29,219
um PCI also sorry about that also has a

909
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,020
secure software

910
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,500
framework that it makes it easier for

911
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,879
you to start implementing the things

912
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,060
that are covered under the PCI DSS spec

913
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,339
they go hand in hand they map back and

914
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,780
forth between the two

915
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,300
uh number 11 there is secure software

916
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,800
updates so

917
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,219
uh that that's there are more Frameworks

918
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,960
out there those are the top ones that if

919
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,460
you're building an appsec program you

920
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,320
need to think about and make sure that

921
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,119
you write your controls to adjust to it

922
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,880
so if we're thinking about how do we get

923
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,599
started with this

924
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,640
and hopefully I can finish before my

925
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,280
plugged in computer dies because it says

926
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,839
my battery is almost gone all right

927
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,020
um

928
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,000
there's no blueprint for your company I

929
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,680
can't tell you exactly what you need to

930
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,180
do but I can tell you that there's six

931
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,700
things that you should consider doing

932
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,379
involved the development team early

933
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,720
access where your organization is Evac

934
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,000
take a good hard look know exactly where

935
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,440
the bodies are buried

936
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,599
which bodies you need to bury and dig up

937
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,000
first and start working on them have an

938
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,099
asset inventory and that asset inventory

939
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,140
isn't just what computers you have or

940
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,119
what it is watching it has to be

941
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,480
everything whether it's a corporate

942
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,839
system whether it's a AWS Cloud resource

943
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,839
even if it's you know something that

944
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,579
just lives there for a while you need to

945
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,380
understand the process that builds it

946
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,119
and when it will show up and when it

947
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,619
will disappear

948
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,359
uh know what you have in the threat

949
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,320
modeling

950
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,300
automate automate and automate I think

951
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
there's no way that you can do this

952
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,960
without automation you won't scale you

953
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,000
have to make sure that every as much as

954
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,119
you can do is automated and then test

955
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,240
evaluate and report and then obviously

956
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,619
rinse and repeat because it's a

957
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,660
continual process it's a program not a

958
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,899
project

959
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,339
places that go in and look at something

960
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,820
as a project for appsec will never

961
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,040
really do a good thing because you'll

962
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
get a little bit of time

963
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,920
once a Sprint once a quarter once a year

964
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,540
or something like that instead of

965
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,520
changing the culture that you need to

966
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,540
have you have to have the security

967
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,920
culture like they're saying in the

968
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,619
Keynotes earlier today

969
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,260
and one of the best ways to involve the

970
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,359
development team early is to have a

971
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,740
security champion

972
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,540
this is a concept that comes out of

973
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,359
besum and that's a really long um

974
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,400
bit of verbiage for anybody who gets the

975
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,560
slides later to remember what I was

976
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,020
talking about at this time but the

977
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,400
important thing is the security

978
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,619
Champions are resources on the

979
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,839
engineering team they are the developers

980
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,900
they have stepped up and said I will own

981
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,660
security for my team okay

982
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,880
the the benefits for them is it looks

983
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,680
good on their resume depending on how

984
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
you roll it out they can get incentives

985
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,460
or you know

986
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,320
um one of the companies I worked for

987
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,359
before if you were a security champion

988
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,280
and you had enough active involvement in

989
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,780
it they would send that champion to

990
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,280
Black Cat

991
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,020
of course not all Champions are

992
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,700
motivated by that so you have to think

993
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,500
about your target audience and what

994
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,060
motivates them some of them might be

995
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,260
fine with

996
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,320
just money so

997
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,960
um

998
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,599
so the Champions role is specifically to

999
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,640
give the security team somebody on the

1000
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,900
engineering team that's directly

1001
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,520
responsible for it

1002
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,280
a

1003
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,240
bi-directional pipe for communication

1004
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,579
the champion can come to the engineer

1005
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,200
saying hey this is what we're working on

1006
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
we need to think about how to do it

1007
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,040
securely and get advice from them and

1008
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,500
then the security Champion can receive

1009
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,960
from application security there anything

1010
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,700
that's coming down the pipe that might

1011
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,619
affect them like hey we heard from

1012
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,500
marketing that we're going after fedramp

1013
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,260
that type of surprise might put a damper

1014
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,720
in the software engineer's day when they

1015
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,400
realize that they have to meet all these

1016
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,480
controls

1017
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
make sure that they're able to host in a

1018
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,619
different area and review all of the

1019
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,240
components that make up their system and

1020
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,380
make sure that they are fed ramp

1021
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,060
authorized

1022
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,619
yeah

1023
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,980
um it's the only way to allow

1024
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,220
security efforts to scale right

1025
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,200
application security Engineers are one

1026
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
hard to find too expensive

1027
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,619
and three

1028
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,800
I don't know the best way to put this

1029
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,760
they just say that they're they're

1030
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,500
overworked just like everybody else in

1031
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,920
the organization so

1032
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,119
you have to have

1033
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,359
a ratio a a small team of application

1034
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,839
security Engineers cannot work with 600

1035
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,140
developers effectively if you have five

1036
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,180
five application security Engineers

1037
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,140
trying to talk to 600 developers that's

1038
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,300
going to make application and security a

1039
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,339
bottleneck form but if you have a

1040
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:22,920
different model and it's you have one

1041
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,900
application security engineer for 10

1042
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,300
Champions per 100 developers now you

1043
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,520
have a very a very good way to scale

1044
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,660
right

1045
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,300
it it adds a layer of indirection that

1046
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,920
can help out

1047
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,579
um

1048
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,800
it also puts somebody on the development

1049
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,780
team that helps spread that culture

1050
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,960
within the within the development and

1051
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,240
team because if he's taken to him they

1052
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,400
respect him they might not respect you

1053
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,839
unless you happen to be like me and

1054
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,280
poached people from the engineering team

1055
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,619
for your application security team

1056
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:53,280
um

1057
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,560
and if marketed correctly it can be a

1058
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,599
competitive differentiator

1059
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,160
okay ISO 27001 is not hard to get you

1060
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,260
have to be right 70 of the time to get

1061
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,180
that certification

1062
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,020
lots of companies have an ISO 27001.

1063
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,520
lots of companies that have been

1064
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,880
breached have an ISO 27001.

1065
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,520
right but if you can demonstrate a

1066
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,560
market that you have a secure product

1067
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,240
especially if you have something like a

1068
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,300
bug boundary program to work on it

1069
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,000
so how do you start it

1070
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,220
Champion program you need to decide what

1071
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,079
you want to accomplish you need to

1072
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,839
decide who is going to participate now

1073
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,640
earlier I said that it's very important

1074
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,180
that this is a volunteer effort right

1075
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,060
sometimes this becomes voluntold but you

1076
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,619
really want it to be a volunteer effort

1077
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:44,760
because that way you find somebody

1078
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,380
that's passionate about it who's

1079
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,359
interested in it already

1080
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,280
you need to clearly Define what is

1081
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,320
expected of them

1082
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,380
and again going back to the training how

1083
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,020
how will you prepare them for the task

1084
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,040
and again upper management support

1085
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,960
and how do you keep the Champions

1086
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,579
interested and that's the gamification

1087
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,920
that I talked about earlier

1088
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,579
um

1089
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,460
so then threat modeling threat modeling

1090
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,260
is usually the second thing I do the

1091
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,359
first thing is adding a software

1092
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,619
security champion

1093
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,780
program so that you have somebody to do

1094
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,119
the threat modelings with now

1095
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,700
application security Engineers can do a

1096
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,800
threat model on their own

1097
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,660
but that's not the most effective way to

1098
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,000
do it the best way is to get in a room

1099
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,980
with your application security engineer

1100
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,500
your security champion and hopefully the

1101
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,060
entire development team if you can take

1102
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,680
a take the time

1103
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
and really start

1104
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,380
getting into what the process and

1105
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,180
business function of the software that

1106
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,280
you're looking at is for so you start

1107
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,020
with identifying what objectives you

1108
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,099
want to have

1109
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,960
then you look at an application

1110
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,820
application overview this is really

1111
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,200
great if your development team already

1112
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,720
has data flow diagrams and flowcharts

1113
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,760
and things that you can work on or that

1114
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,140
might be one of the findings that you

1115
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,579
have from this is that we need these

1116
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,400
before we can do that you break apart

1117
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,500
and decompose the application the most

1118
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,000
important thing there is to think about

1119
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,220
the trust boundaries that any data might

1120
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,619
cross and how you protect the data as it

1121
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,660
crosses those trust boundaries

1122
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,000
start thinking about threats against the

1123
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,560
system and how to identify

1124
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,560
vulnerabilities the most common method

1125
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,460
for that is stride it's an acronym for

1126
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,320
spoofing tampering repudiation

1127
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,359
information enclosure denial of service

1128
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,400
and elevation of privilege

1129
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,480
okay so

1130
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,339
um another common wave

1131
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,500
another common thing to consider at the

1132
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,320
same time is privacy a previous company

1133
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,420
that I've worked with there there's a

1134
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,280
game called elevation of privilege we

1135
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,160
added a privacy deck to that and we'll

1136
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,320
actually see that here in a little bit

1137
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,140
but there's also another common way to

1138
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,820
think about threats and that's attack

1139
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,040
trees where you want to discover

1140
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,319
vulnerabilities

1141
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,440
that instead of just thinking of here's

1142
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,940
a request and a response on what the

1143
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,940
problem is this takes a more uh overall

1144
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,099
Approach at it and you can find Multi

1145
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,200
multi-step attacks and you start

1146
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,579
thinking about what it takes to

1147
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,500
compromise each stage of that and it's a

1148
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,040
much more detailed and rigorous process

1149
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,020
from the adversaries Viewpoint you think

1150
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,000
about how much will it cost them to

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,319
launch the attack

1152
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,780
what's the effort to set up an effort to

1153
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,160
execute

1154
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,099
what are the required tools and skills

1155
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,640
and what is their Roi so and then from

1156
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,680
the defender side you got to think about

1157
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,359
what is the impact of the attack what's

1158
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,460
the cost of the failure what's the

1159
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,260
likelihood that your security operations

1160
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,720
team is going to be able to detect it

1161
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,700
and what is the lowest cost

1162
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,380
countermeasure that you can effectively

1163
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,200
deploy to at least reduce the the

1164
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,599
problem the impact to a reasonable

1165
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,800
amount

1166
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,920
and here's a common example of what an

1167
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,500
attack track tree looks like so in the

1168
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,380
middle it's we a web application was

1169
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,500
compromised because of a

1170
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,079
configuration file modification

1171
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,720
with modules in the web directory

1172
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,180
and the ink file was could be displayed

1173
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,700
in text form so and it's a very visual

1174
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,260
it's easy to work through

1175
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,260
and I'll admit looking at this kind of

1176
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,180
boring developers don't like to do it

1177
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,700
there are eights will glaze over so back

1178
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,319
to that gamification that we're talking

1179
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,020
about Microsoft has the elevation of

1180
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,700
privileged card game it goes against the

1181
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,380
stride

1182
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,200
um there's a OS Cornucopia which has a

1183
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,760
different set of controls that you need

1184
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,720
to work with

1185
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,000
and then the one I found while I was

1186
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,619
researching for this and I need to take

1187
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,560
a closer look at it is the

1188
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,359
um

1189
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,400
attack patterns one in the middle

1190
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,599
okay now let's go back and take a look

1191
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,359
at s-bombs okay

1192
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,119
um anybody XKCD fans here you might

1193
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,040
recognize that cartoon okay at least a

1194
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,839
couple people have seen this I've

1195
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,460
doctored the cartoon a little bit it's

1196
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,740
really hard to see but one of them one

1197
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,839
of the modules now says jQuery another

1198
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,800
one says uh log for Jay and and then

1199
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,480
another one says spring for Shell in

1200
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,640
addition to that one component that

1201
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,260
somebody in Nebraska has been supporting

1202
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,180
since 2003.

1203
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,660
foreign

1204
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,339
well unfortunately Vlog for Jay has

1205
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,560
hundreds and hundreds of developers but

1206
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,380
it's a good example a couple weeks ago

1207
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,940
there was

1208
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,260
um

1209
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,940
a 2007 python

1210
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,440
vulnerability end quote we'll call it

1211
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,180
put it in quotes because the back in

1212
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,619
2007 the developers did not consid deem

1213
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,480
it to be a vulnerability so they did not

1214
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,140
patch it so in 2022 it became very

1215
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,180
popular to exploit

1216
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,540
through this this vulnerability again in

1217
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,880
quotes because it was published back in

1218
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,300
2007 nobody's defended against it and

1219
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,660
that was in the part of the Python main

1220
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,300
library for handling and unzipping files

1221
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,000
so it's

1222
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,060
it's possible to have a overwrite files

1223
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,940
in your file system by crafting a

1224
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,680
malicious tar file and having it

1225
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,859
unzipped on the server because it does

1226
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,800
it it just the writers of the package

1227
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,400
says our job is to unzip tar files so we

1228
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,560
don't care what the tar file says if it

1229
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,700
says it goes out of this Parent

1230
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,920
Directory we write it out of this Parent

1231
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,520
Directory right so

1232
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,560
are they right yeah probably

1233
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,720
their job is to unzip tar files somebody

1234
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,640
else has to

1235
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,260
actually make sure that that makes

1236
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,540
business sense for them to do but if you

1237
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,220
think about the tools that exist whether

1238
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,079
it's sassed or dashed none of them

1239
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,420
detected it

1240
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,760
um and

1241
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,400
it's an interesting question SAS tools

1242
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,280
started to detect it now but if your SCA

1243
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,079
tool isn't detecting it you have no idea

1244
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,579
if the open source libraries you're

1245
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,480
using which may also impress a tar file

1246
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,520
um would would have the same

1247
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,500
vulnerability because they consider that

1248
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,060
a coding problem something that the SAS

1249
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,520
tool would catch so it's a good example

1250
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,000
of wherein you have to be have

1251
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,900
comprehensive knowledge about what's

1252
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,240
going on and think about it

1253
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,900
um for log4j I know that we had

1254
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,180
um many vendors came out with tools to

1255
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,640
detect it not all of those tools were

1256
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,900
created equal

1257
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,880
so I had a vendor give me a tool that

1258
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,980
said this will detect log for J on your

1259
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,020
network I asked him about it and it was

1260
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,780
okay well what it does is it looks in

1261
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,940
your system process table

1262
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,359
for the strings that the attack has

1263
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,420
but the system process table will be

1264
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,240
executing whatever malicious payload the

1265
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,940
log4j attack had so it's way way down

1266
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,099
the stream and those attack indicators

1267
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,940
wouldn't be there anymore

1268
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,660
um

1269
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,980
so

1270
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,460
back to the s-bomb

1271
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,500
we've already said many many times it's

1272
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,300
important to have an understanding what

1273
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,400
you have and

1274
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,280
what compromises your system this is why

1275
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,200
open source is becoming important is

1276
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
because there's 73 percent

1277
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,880
year-over-year growth in the use of Open

1278
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,460
Source which means that more and more

1279
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,619
open source is used less and less custom

1280
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,500
code is written there are 37 million

1281
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,380
open source components

1282
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,000
2.2 trillion open source package

1283
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,240
downloads and 6 million new package

1284
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,720
versions introduced last year

1285
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,700
um a third of them have known

1286
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,880
vulnerabilities

1287
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,760
only six and a half percent of them are

1288
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,079
uh non-popular

1289
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,180
because the big ones with the most

1290
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,380
downloads are the ones that get

1291
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,380
scrutinized and looked and exploited

1292
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,880
um

1293
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,420
the 650 percent increase in supply chain

1294
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,540
attacks over and that's up from 430 and

1295
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,760
220. so it's an exponential curve that

1296
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,920
you're having there my favorite one is

1297
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,260
the next one developers make sub-optimal

1298
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,680
choices 69 of the time regarding

1299
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,680
upgrading third-party components

1300
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,720
so

1301
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,420
that's because of the enormous volume of

1302
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,800
Open Source dependencies that are

1303
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,819
present

1304
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:30,119
the incredible rate of time that goes on

1305
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,099
between them if you're using GitHub

1306
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,260
Advanced security it will tell you that

1307
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,000
there's a new version available it won't

1308
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,560
tell you what's the best one to solve

1309
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,240
the vulnerabilities that exist in that

1310
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,760
right

1311
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,440
it has two different versions but other

1312
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,540
tools if you look at them they have the

1313
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,760
capability of telling you hey not only

1314
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
do you are you using this component the

1315
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,500
one that's mostly likely least likely to

1316
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,800
bork your entire software stack is this

1317
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,000
version

1318
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,300
or it can also they start tracking

1319
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,180
metrics like um how many commits were

1320
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,440
done in the last year how many

1321
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,060
developers made those commits so that

1322
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,859
you can start looking for the ones that

1323
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,319
are actively maintained instead of using

1324
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,880
the one maintained by that one guy in

1325
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,619
Nebraska

1326
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,260
um nist came out with the securing the

1327
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,180
software supply chain recommended best

1328
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,700
practices for developers and really all

1329
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,380
that is is a mapping between this

1330
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,599
document the executive order and the

1331
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,700
ssdf framework

1332
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,280
but the majority of it focuses on the

1333
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
top left corner which again has asset

1334
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,280
inventory and uh vulnerability

1335
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,839
repository so you need to get the handle

1336
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,800
on that when you're thinking

1337
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,780
oh now we're having trouble

1338
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,940
is there a um

1339
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,540
it's plugged in

1340
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,540
let's see did that save it

1341
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:16,740
it does not seem to have changed

1342
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,660
all right well good news is we're almost

1343
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,640
done but I don't know if you'll be able

1344
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
to see it right

1345
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,480
so

1346
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,800
um

1347
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,200
obviously don't use Alpha Beta we'll try

1348
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,440
to get through this before it shuts down

1349
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,760
don't upgrade to a more vulnerable

1350
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,099
version

1351
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,900
um

1352
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,300
okay so I had some expected questions

1353
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,460
what is the minimum that you need in my

1354
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,220
opinion you need security Champions

1355
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,800
developer uh secure development training

1356
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,720
documented understanding of what you're

1357
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,480
trying to include and there it goes so

1358
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,400
um

1359
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,579
okay so I know the rest so we can we get

1360
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:59,099
from here the other thing is I mentioned

1361
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:02,700
bug Bounty once why

1362
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,119
why is that not a important strategic

1363
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,980
way to do things it's great for finding

1364
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,339
stuff but bug Bounty programs

1365
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,099
are the the designs that come from them

1366
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,660
are from the perspective the bounty

1367
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,160
hunters they look for things that they

1368
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,660
know how to find they don't look for

1369
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,760
things that you need them to look for so

1370
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,260
that's why a pen test by qualified

1371
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,619
people is better than a bug Bounty

1372
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,599
program especially since pen tests are

1373
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,400
recognized by most compliance Frameworks

1374
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,800
bug bounties are not

1375
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,740
okay and then there was one more

1376
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,540
expected question that I'll try to get

1377
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,180
back to at some point in time but uh any

1378
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,980
unexpected questions yes sir

1379
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,839
uh what kind of measures

1380
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:51,980
have useful in an access

1381
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,880
findings

1382
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,920
typically and I think

1383
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,500
that not always helpful and not

1384
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,800
in our cases

1385
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,400
how do we communicate to Executives with

1386
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,599
what like how secure our activities I I

1387
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,180
think that's uh it's it's a very good

1388
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,160
question but your metrics journey is

1389
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,480
going to be a journey you're going to

1390
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,460
have to start with the hey this is the

1391
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,440
number of findings we have a lot of the

1392
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,240
times it's being able to take the number

1393
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,099
of findings you have and pivot it and

1394
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:35,099
then something actionable so instead of

1395
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,500
saying that I have 5 000

1396
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,400
um

1397
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,040
issues of this type you can pivot that

1398
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,440
and say I have one issue that says I

1399
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,240
have SQL injection vulnerabilities in my

1400
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,400
system and then design a program to

1401
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,740
focus on that and that will help but the

1402
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,960
trick is when you said going to upper

1403
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,119
management as as you start sending stuff

1404
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,020
up

1405
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,260
the amount of information you can give

1406
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,000
starts to dwindle I give my boss a

1407
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,619
couple of PowerPoint slides I think it's

1408
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:04,020
four right now he has to give his boss

1409
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,020
two he has to give his boss a third of

1410
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,140
the page so you have to make sure that

1411
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,720
your absec risk scores map into your

1412
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,400
governance risk scores and accurately

1413
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,339
reflect on it so but it's a journey you

1414
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,859
have to start with the counts then you

1415
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:21,780
have to start looking at how fast are we

1416
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,460
closing them versus how fast are they

1417
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,400
being created are we making making a

1418
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,200
sustainable program what's the average

1419
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,119
age that they're open and then start

1420
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,900
building up more knowledge after that

1421
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,359
any other questions or did that answer

1422
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:37,440
your question

1423
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,059
okay any other questions

1424
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,500
yes

1425
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,220
if you ask most of the time they will

1426
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,440
step up I actually switched to security

1427
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,559
because I heard the CSO and the CTO

1428
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,660
saying hey we never really need to start

1429
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,880
thinking about application security at

1430
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,740
this company and I'm like you know I

1431
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,720
went to school for that I'll be more

1432
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,819
than willing to help you with that so

1433
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,040
but you what you need to do is design

1434
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,559
the program and then design incentives

1435
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,420
for for the people that you find so if

1436
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,800
you find people that are interested in

1437
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,440
security training you can do the let's

1438
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,480
let's if you participate enough score

1439
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,920
enough points or however you want to do

1440
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,260
it we'll send you to Defcon if you find

1441
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,760
that there are people that are looking

1442
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,099
for supplements to their paycheck go for

1443
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,980
cash Rewards or something like that

1444
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,660
um but you have to sell it to them it

1445
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,339
looks great on your resume it builds

1446
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,839
skills that will go with you no matter

1447
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,380
where you are

1448
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,819
anyone else

1449
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,660
all right

1450
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,160
cool thank you for your time
