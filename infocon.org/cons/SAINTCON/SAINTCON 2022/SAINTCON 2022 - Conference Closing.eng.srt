1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
well good afternoon I hope that you're

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,959
having an awesome day

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm finally having an awesome day this

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,319
is my last presentation

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,160
this one has been prepared far enough in

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,199
advance that it might be some cohesive

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,359
process and it wasn't just random usings

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,100
and things like that

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,859
uh but this presentation goes pretty

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,859
quickly and it goes with a lot of thank

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,300
yous and other things so if you've been

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
to closing ceremonies before

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
you're just going to be applauding the

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,059
whole time and it's fine

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,700
uh and everything else like

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,120
so yeah get it out of your system

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,879
okay let's explain this really quickly

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,300
so for those of you that were not in the

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,800
other presentation just a few minutes

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,379
ago I did give my best explanation for

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,899
this and somebody created this I still

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,300
don't know who I have suspicions

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,260
I have some suspicions but somebody

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,299
photoshopped this on an early picture

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,460
that I took of myself and many of the

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,920
other committee members uh in planning

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,260
probably back in 2014 or something like

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,020
this is old and they photoshopped a

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,520
bunch of unicorn pants and then this

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
shows up every year in slides and other

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,259
things like that and so I finally

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,659
decided I'm going to own it

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,360
like if I own it then I control it right

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,860
so the meme is now mine

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,380
anyways that's it we're not going to

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,320
waste any more time on that okay these

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,700
are going to be similar slides to what

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
you saw during the opening ceremonies

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,759
we're just going to do them in Reverse

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
but not really

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,060
this conference has been brought to you

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,100
by the Utah Saint organization

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,439
and many other people that are not

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,540
directly affiliated with that so here's

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,399
our conference it's a really cool slide

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,220
I dimmed the logos in the back but there

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,619
are a lot of people doing a lot of

48
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,299
interesting and crazy things this year

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,119
and has made this and what I feel is

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,060
probably not even probably this is our

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,640
best cincon conference for content and

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
everything else ever don't applaud yet

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
don't apply yet it's okay hold it hold

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,099
okay you're going to be able to applaud

56
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,780

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,879

closing ceremonies goes by the way this

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,879

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
okay what what

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,599
I should have told you I'm sorry there's

65
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,680

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,800
no I just want you to come up here and

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,180
get the recognition that you deserve for

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,840
the badge

71
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,480
and I don't know where your sweet wife

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,340
is but half of that CL half of those

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,379
claps are for your sweet wife as well

74
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,239
this is MK Factor him and his wife our

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,599
MK Factor this is compy kid Mike he does

76
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,620
an amazing job on our badge every year

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,720
and he's very socially introverted does

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
that even turn on like we don't think so

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,540
okay yeah we need to hear your voice

80
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,519
okay he's alive

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,099
foreign

82
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,720
of all of the people on our conference

83
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,120
planning committee this guy works

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,980
probably the most

85
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,200
because it takes a ton of logistics and

86
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,239
time and energy to develop design

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,459
engineer program like when you're

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,760
building a clue game on a Raspberry Pi

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
Pico how long did that take you a while

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,099
yeah

91
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,019
a while

92
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,280
um when you're designing something from

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,019
the ground up it takes a lot of time so

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,879
they deserve the recognition this is the

95
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,620
same person that builds Defcon badges

96
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,500
now he's part of our community he's part

97
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,780
of our committee and things and so he

98
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,420
deserves the recognition and then all I

99
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,860
was going to do is give you an

100
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,900
opportunity to talk about the badge

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,580
challenge how that went do you have the

102
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,780
winners and stuff ready to go

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
that's great that's fine and then the

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,620
only other thing I'm going to ask you is

105
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,339
what are you willing to share about 2023

106
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,820
badge

107
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,360
apparently nothing they said nothing

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,460
let's use a mic that works better

109
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,440
okay apparently I can't share anything

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,380
so he's he's subject to Authority

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,440
obviously all right as the as the

112
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,180
committee chairman what are you willing

113
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,070
to share about the badge for next year

114
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,520
[Laughter]

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,479
all right

116
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,880
um so next year we'll be very

117
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,160
interactive between attendees we're

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
going back to lots of gameplay between

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
everyone so it should be really awesome

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,940
that's all you get

121
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,699
okay you go sit down now thank you I

122
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,199
mean I've embarrassed you enough thank

123
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,360
you thank you thank you

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,040
okay

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
next year's badge because we only plan

126
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,320
one conference ahead and you know that

127
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,940
that crazy phrase we talked about it

128
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,500
over there just a little bit ago but

129
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
wouldn't it be cool if we've all had

130
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,419
that phrase in our brain right that's

131
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,340
what happened to think about this next

132
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,380
year's batch and it's going to be epic

133
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,639
okay

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,860
uh quickly I'm going to get through uh

135
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,600
and just talk about some of the events

136
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
that we had this year

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,680
um Family Night event was off the hook

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,660
last night

139
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,759
yeah I mean you can sort of apply if you

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,380
want to wait I'll talk to you about all

141
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,880
the rest of these too

142
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,740
but the vent event was brand new this

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,120
year how many of you guys got to share a

144
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,620
story in the events

145
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,039
okay all hypothetically right like this

146
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,139
this happened at some organists asking

147
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,180
for a friend right that's what that's

148
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,039
for sometimes we just need to have

149
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,560
somebody else to listen to and

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,419
understand what we're going through and

151
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,880
that's why we created that I had the

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,120
best story but somebody Chris scheduled

153
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,280
me to speak at the same time as the vent

154
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,479
event so I didn't get to come in and

155
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,520
share mine uh hack in the Box we

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,199
appreciate them they are an unofficial

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,199
part of Saint Khan but across the street

158
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,520
if you want to hang out with the

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,380
Keynotes in the evening and just kind of

160
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,520
chat with some really smart and

161
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,900
interesting people

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,580
I could spend a long time talking about

163
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,199
all the different events we are so

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,699
appreciative to the people that brought

165
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,500
and worked on the different events that

166
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,819
we had this year

167
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,380
hold on

168
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,880
I wasn't supposed to do that okay maybe

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,620
we just and then we want to also thank

170
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,600
our presenters this year we had the

171
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
biggest submissions or the biggest

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,620
number of submissions ever to our call

173
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,139
for presenters almost to the point that

174
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,780
we didn't have to go out and poach beg

175
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,759
borrow and steal people's presentations

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,740
now we did a little bit of that still

177
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,080
but we almost filled our entire

178
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
conference with just submitted

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,860
presentations this year an amazing feat

180
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
for us and it was awesome so we thank

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,440
all of our presenters

182
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,720
it would not be appropriate for me to

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,940
not also thank our sponsors I don't know

184
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,919
how many of you are in the room but the

185
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,220
sponsors are the folks that allow us to

186
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,220
have cool things the badge around your

187
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,620
neck more appropriately all of the free

188
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,919
sodas the discount prices for lunches

189
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,419
and food and all the other things that

190
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,699
we do are made possible in large part

191
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,240
for or by contributions for our sponsors

192
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
they also contribute to our contest

193
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,620
committee or communities events and

194
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,840
other things they help us build the

195
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,099
wireless network that we have to throw

196
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,580
into this into the place and again I'll

197
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,919
mention centricom specifically but they

198
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,139
just decided to upgrade a 10 gig link

199
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,000
right before the conference and we think

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,520
you guys might need this and I and I

201
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,780
don't know if chunks around but he

202
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,280
mentioned the other day that we'd hit

203
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,800
over that gig threshold so we would have

204
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,080
hit the ceiling this year one way or the

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,660
other and so we're grateful that we have

206
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,580
the bandwidth to hang out and have a

207
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,840
good time here I don't know what we did

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,840
with that bandwidth but anyway

209
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,940

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,700
Discord these days I don't know why but

269
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,060
slack sucked so

270
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,860
here we go

271
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,480
um the other thing is a little

272
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,459
housekeeping item if you didn't have a

273
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,779
meal ticket

274
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,339
and you are sitting in this room

275
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,899
watching all of these people eat all

276
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,640
these lunches

277
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,339
go out and grab a lunch while they last

278
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,380
because

279
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,700
oftentimes because there's so few people

280
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,440
that come back for the final Friday

281
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
event that we always because of

282
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
liability if we need to make sure that

283
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,519
there's food for everybody we always

284
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,220
have a ton of food left over and it

285
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,980
hurts my heart when it gets tossed to

286
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,480
the dumpster because they can't take it

287
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,160
to a homeless shelter or somewhere else

288
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,579
because of the timing and and everything

289
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,760
else sorry somebody's trying to call me

290
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,579

291
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,260
please if there's leftovers out there

292
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,640
and everybody's that has a food ticket

293
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,620

294
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,200
lunch so that they get eaten

295
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,940
um and such so we're taking out the meal

296
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,700
card need for that okay this is where

297
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,339
the the thank you part starts for the

298
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,680
the volunteers okay we've talked about

299
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,899
the communities and everything else but

300
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,060
it does literally take an army of people

301
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,660
to volunteer their time and energy to

302
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,399
make this conference happen there are

303
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,079
over a hundred volunteers you've seen

304
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,579
them in the green shirts that looked

305
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,019
just like you see on the screen right

306
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,140
here uh you've seen 40 or so staff

307
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,000
members or committee members so it's

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,820
actually about 60 to 70 people with red

309
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,620
shirts walking around the conference

310
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,720
this week those are the folks that make

311
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,000
this happen they didn't get paid to be

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,019
here

313
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,540
they showed up and they donated their

314
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,000
time and they wanted to chill and have a

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
big security family reunion this week

316
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,860
and so we were here and that's how this

317
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,180
conference runs

318
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,260
so

319
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,420
right now is a great time to applaud our

320
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,980
volunteers and staff members

321
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,119
[Applause]

322
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,480
and then not to be outdone you should

323
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,740
probably get ready or with whatever

324
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,480
you're going to do

325
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,980
this is the conference planning

326
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,899
committee for this year

327
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,459
um the ones that don't that are in

328
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,380
silhouette there's no offense to them

329
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,540
it's just that the artist that does

330
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,360
these drawings uh

331
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,639
takes some time and we didn't there were

332
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,440
some late additions and some changes and

333
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,360
some other things and so we're going to

334
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,740
work on getting more of these really

335
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,139
cool figurines made and things but this

336
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,279
is our conference planning committee

337
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,339
these are the folks that put in that six

338
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,500
months worth of effort to make this

339
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,800
thing run and they are they literally

340
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,440
eat drink and sleep this there are many

341
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,500
nights weekends

342
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,079
and overnights and other things that go

343
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,220
into this conference and these are the

344
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,620
folks that are doing that so give them a

345
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,339
round of applause too

346
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,880
please sir am I allowed to come on the

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,339
stage you may you may I mean if you're

348
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,380
going to do the whole I feel obligated

349
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,940
to point out that this is the first time

350
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,680
Seth's ever been the tall guy in the

351
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,420
back row that's why he likes the slide

352
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,319
okay

353
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,920
I got you

354
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,779
um no but who like I'm saying who's

355
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,880
heard this called troy-con before

356
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,519
if you haven't you raise your hand

357
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,260
there's a reason it's called Troy con

358
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,480
because there is one person who puts in

359
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,220
he says mike puts in the most hours and

360
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,139
I can believe that but

361
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,120
if there is anyone who competes with

362
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,220
Mike it's Troy who very likely puts in

363
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,459
more not just time his house his

364
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,459
personal like for years and years and

365
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,740
years Troy or Saint Khan was Troy's

366
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,139
personal money out of his own pocket

367
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,079
it happens now because he makes it

368
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
happen anything falls through the crack

369
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,100
from anyone on this on the slide here

370
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,959
Troy makes up the difference anything

371
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,639
happens from a volunteer that doesn't

372
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,160
happen Troy makes up the difference his

373
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,959
wife's down there she also needs a shout

374
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,639
out because

375
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,180
she puts up with a lot of this

376
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,860
so

377
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,139
burley's down at registration and she

378
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,180
deserves all that Applause but Troy also

379
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,339
deserves Applause because really

380
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,959
even though it's going even though

381
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,579
there's all these people it literally

382
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,139
would not happen without Troy there

383
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,820
calling every week saying Matt what the

384
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,380
crap why have you not done your stuff

385
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,079
yet I never say that

386
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,060
he uses stronger words that I'm told not

387
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,399
to use I don't

388
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,240
I don't I just like Matt are you there

389
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,160
but really like if you like this

390
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,899
conference this is who you think for the

391
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,639
conference so everyone give Troy a big

392
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,260
thank you and Round of Applause

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,779
it's

394
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,959
it's a true labor of love

395
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,240
I don't deserve nearly as much credit as

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,740
being given

397
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,320
um yeah I'm passionate about it I really

398
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,120
am

399
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,959
um

400
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,260
it's in my blood I I love to inspire

401
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,839
people I love to I mentioned it over

402
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,579
there before the thing the biggest

403
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,040
reward for me is

404
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,920
the aha moment times what I can see when

405
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,279
that kid or that adult or that person

406
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,220
gets security or gets vulnerability for

407
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,800
that first time and realizes hey this is

408
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,000
cool

409
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,579
and I can make a career out of this and

410
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,440
I wouldn't even dare put anybody on the

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
spot but I I'll share with you really

412
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,100
briefly a conversation that I had

413
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,260
earlier this week when I was down and

414
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,699
couldn't move more than 10 feet at a

415
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,620
time because hey he's got Yoda mini

416
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,380
badges he's got Yoda mini badges kind of

417
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,779
thing which is a thing I guess right but

418
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,699
somebody stopped me and said hey thank

419
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,820
you for for what you do I said yeah

420
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,100
great that's fine you know it's a it's a

421
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,839
community effort he says no thank you

422
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,880
for being the one that inspired me

423
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,620
because now I'm in a cyber security

424
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,399
career it's improved my life outcomes I

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,959
was on a totally different trajectory

426
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,480
and I came here and I had an opportunity

427
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,380
to have this light bulb moment and my

428
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,600
whole trajectory changed and I'm way

429
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,699
better off for it and it's not about the

430
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,259
money that you make if you're in cyber

431
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,940
security because the money's not bad for

432
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,620
a lot of cyber security jobs and things

433
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
like that but when you can improve

434
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,459
somebody's life that's all the thanks

435

470
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,039
everything that happened down on the

471
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,120
first floor

472
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,440
um actually that's a lie the contest

473
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,080
happened everywhere

474
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,740

475
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,380

476
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,960
have done these without the without the

477
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,700

um no but really it I like a lot of what

485
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
Troy said the reason that everyone comes

486
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,020
back is because we love the people we

487
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,360
want to hang out with you guys and if I

488
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,860
didn't have staff and volunteers I'd

489
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,419
have to work the whole time but instead

490
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,039
I get to hang out with people and I

491
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,620
appreciate that they do my job for me

492
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,820

little bit about your contest and uh our

578
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,120
first place winner yeah yeah so this

579
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,280
year we had a bunch of

580
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,320
uh different cards that would open a

581
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,640
card reader and they were different

582
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,740
kinds ranging from a super easy card low

583
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,260
frequency all the way up to i-class SC

584
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,720
which technically can't be cloned but

585
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,480
there is a bypass and so we had uh two

586
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,620
people who were able to do that hard

587
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,120
challenge this year our first place

588
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,880
winner was RAV Vader and we have a prox

589
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,400
Mark III for him uh so everybody clap

590
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,820

them to you at the end of closing

594
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,679
ceremonies next up scavenger hunt I

595
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,900
think we had someone yeah Marv had to go

596
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,280
home I don't know if you guys know Marv

597
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,760
but he had anyway his legs broken up and

598
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,100
he he came literally through the pain to

599
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,140
be here for the scavenger hunt and I

600
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,520
will say that I got the most last

601
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,900
personally out of the scavenger hunt

602
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,460
watching people look for the random

603
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,960
stuff I don't know where he comes up

604
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
with this these ideas

605
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
um possibly some of the most random

606
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,539
things I've ever seen on a scavenger

607
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,419
hunt but it was awesome to see people I

608
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,720
saw pink uh Green Day out or LPS I saw a

609
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,799
whole bunch of random things that I

610
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,240
didn't think I'd see at St con but

611
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,980
bi-directional diodes

612
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,559
I I don't even know I I have nowhere I

613
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,740
don't know

614
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,799
um

615
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,659
yes okay

616
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,220
uh so in for the scavenger hunt again

617
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,840
there were a ton of people and at the

618
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,460
very end I think that one person pushed

619
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,460
through but third place 801 Labs give

620
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,940
them a hand second place tfq

621
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,740
I think so they're a husband and wife

622
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,360
that aren't here but they did an amazing

623
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,620
job and kind of this their first

624
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,780
conference and they said to jump in and

625
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,220
at their very first conference they took

626
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
second place in scavenger hunt which is

627
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,039
impressive

628
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,919
and first place was Professor are you

629
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,000
here

630
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,580
all right give him a hat give him a nice

631
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,900
round of applause come up for your

632
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,120
prizes after this we appreciate that and

633
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,460
again literally buckets of things came

634
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,039
in for this it was a ton of fun to watch

635
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,780
and uh there's a little great breakdown

636
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,580
of scoring overall as he's my slide

637
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,280
password cracking I think you want me to

638
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,419
handle this

639
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,039
um so Pastor cracking is a community

640
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,960
that teaches you a little about Pastor

641
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
cracking hash cracking understanding the

642
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,580
the rigs the hardware and how to mostly

643
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,059
assemble uh board lists and uh mutation

644
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,220
rules so you can crack efficiently so

645
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,500
you're it's not just a raw Brute Force I

646
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,120
would say props go out to them this year

647
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,520
for making it so that to be competitive

648
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,400
you didn't need to have eight GTX 9 30

649
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,860
90s you could do it with

650
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,900
like I was talking to one of the

651
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,460
attendees and he said on his laptop he

652
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,700
was in second place and I that that is

653
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,580
hard from a creation of the contest

654
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,740
perspective to do that and so Props to

655
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,720
them for doing that but props also the

656
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,100
people who won they came back with the

657
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,080
most moderator show off uh welcomed a

658
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,640
lot of players and a lot of people

659
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,340
involved as uh zodiac said so they came

660
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
as a contest they started the community

661
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,360
they came back as a contest uh they've

662
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,940

00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,460
have to do it stealthily not not let

756
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,360
anyone know you were there

757
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,679
and stop by our booth and interacted we

758
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,720
also had our contest we had about like

759
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,539
28 entries so and we did a team this

760
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,460
year so there were team challenges so

761
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,539
for those that haven't played Tampa

762
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,299
evident uh basically you're given a box

763
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,159
so there's just real quick right now

764
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,779
yeah 30 seconds so you were given kind

765
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,520
of like a mini box right to mini

766
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,840
briefcase um they were actually

767
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,820
handcuffed to it they had to go through

768
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,200
multiple layers of tamper evident

769
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
devices right had to bypass it and make

770
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,620
sure it looked like you didn't get in

771
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,880
and actually had to replace a

772
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,860
fingerprint this year so they had to

773
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,480
lift up the tape wipe it off and put

774
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,039
their own chocolate covered fingerprint

775
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,140
on it so we had some great entries this

776
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,779
year it was actually came down to a tie

777
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,000
first and second and deciding factor was

778
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,460
speed so but in third place we had

779
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,700
Rick's risk services and then in second

780
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,279

and

783
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,679
some of these tamper evidence a great

784
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,299
example of where even if you weren't

785
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,620
competing in the competition they had

786
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,419
things for you to go and do I personally

787
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,340
used it to remove RFID stickers that I

788
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,440
put where I shouldn't have

789
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,500
um it's good and JC thanks you Amelia

790
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,179
because they were he's where I put them

791
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,260
where they shouldn't have been and he

792
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,279
appreciates that they moved

793
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,899
all right hello everyone we had a very

794
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,960
big update this year so we overalled our

795
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,000
entire Vault our goal was to use

796
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,380
commercial grade metal doors

797
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,779
construction we even increased the locks

798
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,240
we had skiff locks we had Trilogy locks

799
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,740
that you see in airports to restrict

800
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
access we had a high frequency i-class

801
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,799
readers big upgrade we removed the runs

802
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,539
so there's no more time to approach you

803
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,919
didn't have to gather a team and wait

804
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,080
wait wait everything was self-service

805
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,720
externally facing who had an opportunity

806
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,100
to experience the vault

807
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,860
are you not impressed

808
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,299
all right who here gotta play with the

809
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,460
safes

810
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,039
I'm bringing more safes next year

811
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,960

812
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
liked it maybe maybe not it's good all

813
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,419
right I'll bring it uh we also had the

814
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,100
safe cracking all of our doors all of

815
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,779
our safes every day got progressively

816
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,240
harder one after another we had an

817
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,039
attendee who this was her first

818
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,020
information security conference went

819
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,880
through all of our safes had no safe

820
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,640
tracking experience

821
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,799
yeah that blew me away I still can't

822
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,080
figure it out and I run the thing uh

823
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,279
however I just want to say we couldn't

824
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,020
make this happen without the help of our

825
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,059
team thank you I want to recognize my

826
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,919

this is the end of Saint Khan uh but I

983
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,020
often get asked right after this like

984
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,460
what can we do to help so I'm just going

985
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,440
to answer the question right now there's

986
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,119
a lot of tear down and other things that

987
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,280
we have to do in order to be able to get

988
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,200
out of here and go home and start

989
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,180
sleeping and making up for the hours of

990
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,160
sleep that we've missed and so if you

991
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,079
are willing and wanting to help a couple

992
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,839
of things that you can do is that like

993
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,520
the power strips not the things

994
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,500
not the runs of power chords but just

995
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,720
the power strips themselves if you can

996
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,460
pick them up when you're when we're done

997
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,079
here and to like set them on the desk to

998
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,240
make them easier for people to grab and

999
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,760
put away things like that are easy if

1000
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,320
you have more time that you can dedicate

1001
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,359
to helping us tear things down go find

1002
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,400

1003
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,780
downstairs in the Expo floor that's

1004
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,640

1005
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,980
teardown and other things happen please

1006
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,320

1007
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,640

1010
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,660
help but we want to make sure that the

1011
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,460
AV gear is treated carefully and so he's

1012
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,380
got some volunteers and things generally

1013
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,440
