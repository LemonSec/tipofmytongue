1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,840
well I'm I'd like to congratulate

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,299
everyone for making it to 4 30.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:06,899
um

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,120
that's something that I can hardly do

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,160
some of these days

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,000
um

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,059
so I am Gabe Morrison I'm a senior cyber

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,820
security engineer at agio

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,539
um

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,140
agio is a managed I.T and cyber security

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,680
services business

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,699
we specialize in xdr open xdr and we'll

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,560
talk a little bit about that but I

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,600
really want to talk about building your

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,180
xdr stack the collection of things that

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,820
you put together that help you have the

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,640
capability to detect and respond to

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,260
cyber threats

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,960
so uh just a tiny bit of background on

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,059
me I've been working with managed

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,840
service providers I.T and mssps and

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
cyber security for about eight years now

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
sort of warming my way through the

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
industry

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
um I've

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,899
I've

27
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,760
recently gone back and done my Master's

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,659
at suu I see a couple classmates

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,280
uh

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,900
Masters in cyber security and

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,799
information assurance so with that and

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,840
my experience with mssps I've had the

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
the opportunity to see how a lot of

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,280
different companies potentially hundreds

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,380
of different companies compile their

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,100
stacks for the capability of xdr

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,320
and I've been directly involved in many

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,360
of those so I feel like I have a sort of

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,659
a unique perspective on this

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,460
I've also been yelled at plenty by

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,860
plenty of csos I feel like that's pretty

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,560
important here as well so I'm sure you

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,119
guys feel that

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,060
so whether you call them msps or mssps

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,700
or mdrs or xdr infosec or just the

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,439
security people you know they make a

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,899
huge difference on how effective your

48
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,479
security posture can be because they're

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
compiling your stack

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,700
you know so what we try to do at agio is

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,939
we try to extract the value of all those

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,380
different products and integrate them

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,420
together and give you the this is

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,840
painful to say single pane of glass

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,979
because we have to have that because

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,959
we're a service provider we already have

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
that

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,620
um that's like how do you how you do

59
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,680
one-to-many Service uh uh provide

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,020
one-to-many services

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,459
so

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,080
um

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,800
let's move on

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,339
it's not moving on

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,180
there we go

66
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,860
so here's the elephant in the room what

67
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,420
even is xdr what does that mean uh well

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,459
it stands for extended detection

69
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,620
response

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
um is it like the buzzword of the year

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
you know uh I know a lot of antivirus

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,160
companies are marketing their next-gen

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,760
AV as you know some kind of catch-all

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,720
xdr that goes into you know everything

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,940
um like uh my brother works for

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,160
crowdstrike for instance and it looks

77
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,319
like they're trying to expand into this

78
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,220
uh into the the void left by other

79
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,819
maybe not so great ideas like soar you

80
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,060
could put that in a different product

81
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,379
a lot of these things you can put in

82
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,120
different products and that's exactly

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,580
what crowdstrike and carbon black are

84
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,920
trying to do they would call that native

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,360
xdr

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,000
one product to rule them all

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,099
but even such a thing would need to

88
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,599
connect into different things they're

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,860
not on your network they don't have

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,959
Network Taps you know I think we'll be

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,519
calling it something else by the time

92
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,860
the the EDR vendors are are truly xdr

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,159
so uh what about mssps

94
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,819
um

95
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,220
you know they've sort of been doing this

96
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,739
for a while already integrating your

97
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,319
different products it's just the

98
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,940
challenge with that is it was always

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,519
more of a product specific and contract

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
specific sort of pigeonhole

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,340
everything into one space

102
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,780
because that's how you do contracts and

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,659
you're an mssp mssp managed security

104
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,640
services provider in case anyone's

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,180
because I lost anyone uh so they've been

106
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,279
doing this for a long time

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,100
um having to integrate everyone's

108
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,160
EDR and cloud and you know everything

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,220
into a log server or a Sim so those

110
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,160
contracts had to be very specific

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,020
uh you know those vendors MSP vendors

112
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,540
don't necessarily care if you have all

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,720
the capability for xdr

114
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,240
that's not their job to make sure you

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,460
you went to them and you're hiring them

116
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,000
to do a product or manage a product or

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
make phone calls

118
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,419
so it's very different from the client

119
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,880
and and mssp perspective

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,699
so is this sort of what an mssp can

121
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,620
evolve into

122
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,580
uh yes so that's exactly what agio is

123
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,740
trying to do and trying to do with azure

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,840
xdr

125
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,020
um

126
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,259
but we're taking more of a

127
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,320
capability approach we're we're looking

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
at this and we're saying where are the

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,960
assets that exist in people's networks

130
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,860
today

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,500
now we've got containers we've got SAS

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,080
we have public Cloud private cloud and

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,900
then all the traditional stuff too

134
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,160
so we we really want to we don't want to

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
tell you garbage in garbage out like

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,520
it's your fault that your sim isn't

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,400
picking anything up we want to actually

138
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,860
detect things we want to have standards

139
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,639
a little tip for selecting an MSP have

140
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,560
standards that you want them to have

141
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,780
standards and requirements because

142
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,780
if they're looking at it in terms of

143
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,759
transactional you pay us and we give you

144
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,500
this thing or we manage it or kick out

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,660
reports every once in a while you know

146
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,039
it's not really helping you with all

147
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,979
these domains so we take a a capability

148
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,919
based approach so we build your stack

149
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,620
to have a capability-based approach so

150
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,259
that we don't blame you for when your

151
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,280
security isn't working

152
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,780
um

153
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,400
excuse me

154
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,900
so with the capability-based approach if

155
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,780
you don't have something that solves a

156
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,759
problem or gives you the capability to

157
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,979
detect and respond in certain domains

158
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,660
will provide it

159
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,319
nice hat

160
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
so we have to build a functional stack

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,160
for every single client so let's turn

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,520
let's think in terms of capabilities

163
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
um

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,740
this is by no means a an exhaustive list

165
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,460
of controls and capabilities that you

166
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,100
might want to think of to fulfill these

167
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,800
controls this is sort of just uh let's

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,280
call it the Continuum of of security

169
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,500
controls

170
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
so you're you're thinking about your

171
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,940
capability to enforce or to report on or

172
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,340
to enable some of these

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,919
some of these

174
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,000
controls to exist

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
so

176
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
you probably want to use some sort of

177
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,139
Matrix for this you I would recommend

178
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,900
going through this exercise with all

179
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,720
your all your vendors especially ones

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,860
like msps so you can have a good idea of

181
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,060
what they're actually going to do for

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,620
you and what they're not that's very

183
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,360
important

184
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,139
um

185
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,460
so if you're not aware of it you can't

186
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,880
protect it asset management is the first

187
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,940
component of capability in terms of

188
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,880
being able to enforce these controls so

189
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,979
controls like authentication principle

190
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,139
of least privilege multi-factor data

191
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,539
backup your policy for cyber security

192
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,199
mapping data device encryption secure

193
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
system configuration the list goes on

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,300
and on you you might have big fix you

195
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,020
might have cassaya you might have uh

196
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,360
you might have a land sweeper just

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,159
something that will enable you to have

198
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,039
the capability to know about all the

199
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,020
assets that you have out there even the

200
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,099
ones that you have to actively find that

201
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,260
maybe aren't being deployed in a way

202
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,720
that that you expect

203
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,980
so

204
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,200
you got to be aware of it I think

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,940
there's a few other products that that

206
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,160
work in this space if you don't have it

207
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,660
then

208
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,480
then we provide it

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,339
um

210
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,399
you know this is where you're going to

211
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,220
enforce some remediation you know this

212
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,100
this might be some automation stuff to

213
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,899
deploy software packages if you can't

214
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,000
deploy software packages to endpoints

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
you've got to get something better my

216
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
SCCM even

217
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,939
so

218
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,019
if

219
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,899
so if you're measuring it

220
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,700
then you can improve it you've ever

221
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,260
heard the phrase never measured never

222
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,600
improved so environmental sense I'm

223
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
sorry this entire selection is just that

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,120
uh environmental sensing is the way that

225
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,180
you can you can measure your the

226
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,580
effectiveness of all these controls that

227
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,339
you've put on your Continuum uh

228
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,180
you're able to say yes we are enforcing

229
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,339
authentication at these points yes

230
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,260
principle of least privilege we couldn't

231
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,640
escalate privileges with our

232
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,860
vulnerability scanner this is where your

233
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,140
vulnerability scanner comes in in handy

234
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,640
this is where your IDs IPS DLP

235
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,260
all of those things and some of the

236
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,360
packet capture that we're doing and file

237
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,120
reassembly malware sandbox

238
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,820
that is where the data is being

239
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,860
collected from your your environmental

240
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,740
sensing capability

241
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,620
and don't overlook your cloud

242
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,839
when you're when you're trying to select

243
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,380
a different products to build into a

244
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,620
stack that can do this for your specific

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,380
controls you got to think about what's

246
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,720
in the cloud how do I get at it how do I

247
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
get information about it how can I

248
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,380
discover things that aren't supposed to

249
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,920
be there and how do I how do I actually

250
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,560
find a way to enforce some of these

251
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,019
controls or even know that that they're

252
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,120
being put in place

253
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,480
um

254
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,700
endpoint security that's exactly what

255
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,440
you're thinking it is that's your crowd

256
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,480
strike that's your carbon black that's

257
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,860
your uh

258
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,300
that's that's your silence uh these are

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,220
the people that want to dominate xdr

260
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,320
these are the these are the the players

261
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
that want to be native xdr endpoint

262
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
security so you can actually enforce

263
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,540
most of these but

264
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,459
on a very

265
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,579
on a very basic level this is where all

266
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,740
the code is executed this is where all

267
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,240
your humans are spending most of their

268
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
time

269
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
this is where

270
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,860
all of your people are reading their

271
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,480
emails this is where they're interacting

272
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,000
with company data they're saving files

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,260
they're sending them they're reading

274
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,600
emails they're sending emails the buck

275
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,980
stops here so a lot of thought into the

276
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,959
the

277
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,660
advanced access accidentally

278
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,180
EDR is where that is really at

279
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,120
so we are looking at data collection

280
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,279
analysis

281
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,959
so you need someone to put all this data

282
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,820
right you've got all these systems in

283
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,680
your stack you've got you've got control

284
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,300
of your endpoints you can deploy

285
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,940
software you can scan them you can see

286
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,980
them on the network you can discover new

287
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,720
stuff so like

288
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,260
where do you put all that uh

289
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,060
a lot of people call it the single pane

290
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,640
of glass I alluded to earlier

291
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,820
um you might have heard that one or two

292
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,079
billion times but it's it's important to

293
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,459
have one place to put all that because

294
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,620
you need the data to be structured and

295
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,480
you need to need a way to sift through

296
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,720
it and maybe look back in time if you

297
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,100
discovered something that happened a

298
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,660
long time ago

299
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
so

300
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,760
you've also got to run some algorithms

301
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,040
and machine learning and a lot of Sims

302
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,600
will let you do that a lot of tools will

303
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,459
let you define your own machine learning

304
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,160
models we work with the SIM vendor that

305
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
we use it's it's Stellar cyber it's

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,500
their open xdr platform we work with

307
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,519
them to improve their machine learning

308
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,740
because of the relationship we have

309
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,139
but that's by no means the only way you

310
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,139
can do that ibmq radar does this Splunk

311
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,459
does this

312
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,680
uh does Splunk do this

313
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm getting a nod

314
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,860
well not xdr but uh you're on machine

315
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,920
learning models yeah

316
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,459
so

317
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,339
this is where this is where you get your

318
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,019
Baseline on all of these things like

319
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,459
your data mapping and your cyber

320
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,399
security policy you're you're building a

321
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,959
baseline you know you want to know if

322
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,579
it's geographically improbable access

323
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,380
you're writing all your detection rules

324
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,639
or maybe someone's writing them for you

325
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
that's us uh you know you probably want

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,740
to know some potentially interesting

327
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,079
checks and balances with your security

328
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,240
controls you know MFA conditional access

329
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,399
you might want to know certain patterns

330
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,620
around those things like that's unusual

331
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,660
and it doesn't indicate a problem but

332
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,399
you know maybe we should talk to that

333
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
person and say what are you doing

334
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,660
um

335
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,399
and potentially interesting things that

336
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,120
you didn't know you wanted to know like

337
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,180
uh what's the what's the least

338
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,820
the least common Windows logs you know

339
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,800
it's the I shutdown for who knows what

340
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,160
reason or uh you know really bad ones

341
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
like uh memory allocation failure or

342
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
something

343
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
so you probably also need a way to

344
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,600
coordinate your efforts and get alerts

345
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,060
and incidents so this is the system that

346
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,700
you'd be looking for to say assign an

347
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,860
incident to collect artifacts into an

348
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,019
incident assign it to an analyst have

349
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,959
them put their notes on there and what

350
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
they did if they responded or if they

351
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,740
escalated

352
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,860
um and also uh this is the system where

353
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,480
I'd recommend kicking off your

354
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
automations from

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
you don't need a sore you need someone

356
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,540
who can write scripts and any basic Sim

357
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,579
on the planet

358
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,820
to collect all of your data

359
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,519
well is it all of your data though not

360
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,079
really

361
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,339
um we'll talk about that in a minute

362
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,120
because you should not try to collect

363
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,880
all data possible

364
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,060
so this is where we collect our data uh

365
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,040
this is the Stellar cyber open xdr

366
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,079
platform that little loop-de-loop right

367
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,120
there is sort of their interpretation of

368
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,839
the minor attack the miter attack kill

369
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,139
chain excuse me the Lockheed Martin kill

370
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,040
chain

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,459
and they've mapped everything to miter

372
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,920
so everything is pretty much the same

373
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
except for the loop because this is

374
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,839
supposed to model the actual threat

375
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,000
activity they're going to get a

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,380
persistent foothold and they're not

377
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,240
going to go and do initial attempts

378
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,540
again they're going to explore propagate

379
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,180
and then drop another place as a

380
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,160
persistent foothold potentially every

381
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,339
time so this helps us figure out how

382
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,199
many Loops they went through that's how

383
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,959
many places we have to remediate and of

384
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,180
course exfil and impact

385
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,760
so it's an interesting take

386
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,220
um and I get a lot of times uh well what

387
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,899
what do you detect what's the whole list

388
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,139
of rules uh up in the top left

389
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,699
detections dot stellar cyber.ai

390
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,360
most Sims will have a list of detections

391
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,959
um

392
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,518
more or less complicated

393
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,480
interestingly enough their list you can

394
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,160
it's actually a web app you can sort

395
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,259
through and filter

396
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,339
um

397
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,560
by data source data type tactic

398
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,839
technique kill chain stage any of those

399
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,079
things

400
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm going to skip past all that

401
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,940
I explained it

402
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,220
all right

403
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,860
so there's also booby traps

404
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,240
um if you if you look into

405
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,040
uh well actually first of all does

406
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,140
anyone know what a

407
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,260
what a zero knowledge proof is

408
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
anyway

409
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,959
a zero knowledge proof is where I can

410
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,780
prove to you that I say I know what you

411
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,339
wrote on a piece of paper and put into

412
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,480
your safe

413
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,520
if I could prove that I know that

414
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,919
without saying here's the combination of

415
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
the safe and proving that I have access

416
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,100
to the safe

417
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,260
so even though I might not show you that

418
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,360
I've accessed the safe or do it in front

419
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
of you I can look at what you wrote on

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,520
that piece of paper and and you know a

421
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,860
hundred percent certainty that I've been

422
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,299
in that safe

423
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,919
or that I know someone who's been in

424
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,799
that safe and I'm tricking you so

425
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,880
this is where you can cover a ton of

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,400
different security controls with a very

427
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,660
simple

428
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,559
concept called Canary tokens

429
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,760
and honey pots so at the very simplest

430
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,200
layer a canary token is a DNS web bug or

431
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,679
a DNS entry or a web bug that whenever

432
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,320
it gets looked up then you can generate

433
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,780
a notification you can grab browser

434
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,120
information

435
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,500
you know whoever just scanned that QR

436
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,700
code please update your iOS device

437
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,039
you can cover so many things phishing

438
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,160
protection you can have you can have

439
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,880
tracking pixels you can have AWS API

440
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,860
Keys suppose you think someone's getting

441
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,260
in your password Vault put some fake API

442
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,940
keys in there you'll find out real quick

443
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,500
for for AWS or azure

444
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,380
um you can also

445
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,539
you can also put in slack API Keys

446
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,500
Windows folders S3 bucket credentials uh

447
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,960
Office 365 mailbug and the one that I

448
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,660
have a lot of fun with is QR codes

449
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,059
because you can sort of like

450
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,179
you can you can take the QR code you can

451
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,740
have a custom domain so it looks like

452
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,900
it's your domain suppose you wanted to

453
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,700
know if someone was in your Telecom

454
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,000
closet your Telecom room you know slap

455
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,039
one of those on everything if someone

456
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,320
scans it then you know someone's been

457
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
there

458
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,260
uh it's just a way for you know the

459
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,960
attacker the threat actor to badge in

460
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,780
and you know it

461
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,799
um

462
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,919
all kinds of canary tokens

463
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,840
that's just the canary tokens by the way

464
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,000
the Honeypot you can masquerade as any

465
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,720
OS any network stack any Mac address it

466
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
can contain Canary tokens so how many

467
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,179
people have a server called dc01

468
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,380
or accompany something dc01

469
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,940
what if what if a company name Dash dc01

470
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,360
was actually just a Honeypot and it was

471
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
collecting all that information Jim

472
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,700
Shakespeare was giving a half day

473
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,160
training yesterday

474
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
um

475
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,640
which I attended talking about active

476
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,640
directory exploits and you know at the

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
end of that I was thinking wow you know

478
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,980
we could have gotten almost this far we

479
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,840
could have wasted this much of an

480
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,400
attacker's time

481
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,140
just by making that a honey pot and

482
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,919
choosing server 2022

483
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,080
uh the windows Network stack joining

484
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,120
into the domain giving it a whole bunch

485
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,940
of uh let's let's put an IT folder on

486
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,840
there and put uh and put PS exec 64 on

487
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,620
there except it's not PS exact 64. it's

488
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,419
calc.exe and we just got a notification

489
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,400
when you ran it when when the threat

490
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,140
actor is trying to live off the land and

491
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,820
runs it

492
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,460
so a lot of cool things you can do with

493
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,000
Canary tokens and honey pots and that is

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,980
one of the ways that we're trying to

495
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,780
extract the value out of some of these

496
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,440
systems for our clients uh security

497
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
controls continuum

498
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,720
and I really haven't talked about any

499
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,360
vendors so far uh because you're

500
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,500
probably wondering well yeah but what

501
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,240
data should I actually collect do I need

502
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,820
everything from everywhere uh well no

503
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
actually

504
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,360
that's kind of why I pointed towards

505
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,160
this detections list you probably want

506
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,500
to know what your sim is capable of and

507
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,640
what you're actually interested in

508
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
detecting because you can't pay enough

509
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,080
people to write enough rules to detect

510
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,559
everything and you can't afford for your

511
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,919
security and Analysis analysts excuse me

512
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,740
your security analysis and analysts I

513
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,140
did it again to to be sifting through

514
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,080
data they never needed so I would

515
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,419
recommend for operational data you know

516
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,880
testing your apps you know get some

517
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,100
other cheaper system to do that and

518
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,900
don't waste don't waste a cyber security

519
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,480
a system don't waste your your xdr

520
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
platform on operational data that you

521
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,700
don't actually have to pay anyone to

522
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,860
look at that data or sorry you don't

523
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,179
have to pay your security team to look

524
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,780
at that data

525
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,260
okay so where's the r portion of this

526
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,980
there's xdr right it's response uh

527
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,440
extended detection and response well

528
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,320
that's where it really gets dicey so a

529
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,320
lot of these are custom you know I

530
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,780
mentioned having your your single pane

531
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,919
of glass

532
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,780
to be the place where you're launching

533
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,360
automations from and managing incidents

534
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,500
from

535
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,240
and that's really where I'd recommend

536
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,700
doing this find find a Sim that can

537
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,820
launch those and I know a lot do it I've

538
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,400
worked with qradar for a long time you

539
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,740
can execute scripts Stellar cyber

540
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,799
openxdr can execute scripts in fact you

541
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,440
can have the analysts or you can have

542
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,900
the analysts insert parameters to put

543
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,059
into scripts to automate

544
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,400
you know because you don't want your

545
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,460
your security analysts having access to

546
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,620
active directory to mess with people's

547
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,140
accounts you know access to a firewall

548
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,940
that they don't manage you don't want

549
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,100
them to have access to things to do

550
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,340
things that are out of their wheelhouse

551
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,080
so that's kind of where automation comes

552
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,820
in I don't know if you notice but every

553
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,340
single one of these has automation lit

554
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,459
up

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,299
that's because you can automate all of

556
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,440
that

557
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,520
uh

558
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,340
you can you can automate

559
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,500
things that our repeatable processes

560
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,600
that help you avoid giving that access

561
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,820
to a human

562
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,340
so

563
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,780
this is our stack if you don't have some

564
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,419
of these capabilities in terms of azio

565
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,760
xdr if you don't have these you know

566
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,080
bring what you have

567
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
we'll figure out what you need and we'll

568
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,260
provide that

569
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,179
so uh hopefully this was interesting to

570
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,700
you I was really enjoying geeking out

571
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,120
about the canary tokens but does anyone

572
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,760
have any questions or

573
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,240
anything

574
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,039
turn down

575
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,100
how difficult is it to deploy character

576
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,880
super easy uh what you essentially do is

577
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,460
you can choose which one there's a free

578
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,500
I should start out with there's a free

579
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,400
way to do this you can do it yourself

580
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
canarytokens.org is their their free

581
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,340
tokens you can't put your own uh you

582
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,080
can't put your own domain on those you

583
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,240
can't like join it to a domain or sorry

584
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,360
you're talking Canary tokens

585
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,159
um super easy you essentially choose

586
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,260
what you want and then you type in a

587
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,120
memo to remind yourself and then you

588
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,900
type in a an email address to notify the

589
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,419
Enterprise version of of uh thanks to

590
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,860
Canary is actually what we're using

591
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,360
under the hood for this

592
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,659
and they'll let you

593
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,840
customize everything about it the domain

594
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,840
the link it can be an image it can be a

595
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,779
QR code it can be a slow redirect so it

596
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,120
grabs browser information and then sends

597
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,039
them to somewhere else I use that

598
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,799
everywhere I have these everywhere in my

599
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,520
car

600
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,740
there's in my car console there's a full

601
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,020
sheet printout of a QR code that's I

602
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,299
just wrote Bitcoin on it just in case

603
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,820
anyone's rifling through my car uh I've

604
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,320
got one on the bottom of my laptop and

605
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,080
on my phone you know imagine imagine

606
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,679
getting an email for you know your phone

607
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,919
going through you know some security you

608
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,860
know they're super easy write a memo

609
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,380
yeah

610
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,360
it works by DNS so if if I so the way

611
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,580
they do it is they create a DNS entry

612
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,159
for a

613
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,140
hostname.03n.io is actually their their

614
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,940
default domain

615
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,240
and if someone makes a DNS query to look

616
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
up that host you get an alert

617
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,480
same thing with like the uh

618
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,000
the the honey pot Works in a very

619
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,159
similar way it actually uses DNS

620
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,480
tunneling to communicate with the

621
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,380
console

622
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,419
so that can set off some of our alerts

623
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,720
but essentially it almost doesn't even

624
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,700
have to have a valid network

625
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,659
configuration because it can ARP and it

626
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,440
can have it can get that DNS out even if

627
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,740
it doesn't have the right Gateway

628
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,799
the right the right subnet mask or you

629
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,679
know it can get it out

630
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,260
so it's really clever and half their

631
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,659
file tokens work that way too you know

632
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,299
it creates a unique DNS and once you

633
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,720
look it up it fires and often gives

634
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
extra information

635
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,880
yeah

636
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,659
any other questions

637
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,559
nice to see Curtis

638
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,640
yeah that's where it does get dicey so

639
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
sometimes uh all you have to do is write

640
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,279
an API connector that's how some of that

641
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,140
data gets into the Stellar cyber

642
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,539
platform other than logs but if it's

643
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,480
logs that are just in a flat file

644
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,679
they have an agent where you can get

645
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,100
that you can have this system uh you

646
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,299
know it depends on how it's structured

647
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,120
if it's already Json then you just you

648
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,100
just point the agent the log collection

649
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,740
agent at that and it gets in there

650
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,620
on the Stellar cyber side they do have

651
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,659
to write a parser for that and they are

652
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,580
fairly on top of it

653
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,678
it varies though I will say

654
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,080
yeah yeah I know I know it's painful to

655
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,140
write a custom parsers or dsms for

656
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,380
qradar and some for Splunk too but you

657
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,559
know it's that's something that that we

658
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,559
rely more on the vendor to do so it's

659
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,640
kind of more like an Alien Vault

660
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,179
situation

661
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,860
yeah

662
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,639
any other questions

663
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,880
all right

664
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
well if you're interested in chatting

665
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,360
more about it I'm I'll be up here for a

666
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,760
few more minutes you can come get my

667
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,100
card I have

668
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,320
um I have some other people with me that

669
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,000
