1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
okay let's get started welcome all uh I

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,140
have the envious time slot of being

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,700
right before lunch so we'll see how this

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,900
goes

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,300
um my name is Brian Hoops I'm the CSO at

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,099
Deseret digital media

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,279
uh one of the reasons I'm here is who is

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,840
Deseret digital media if you're from

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,939
Utah you may or may not have heard of us

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,859
by show of hands who's heard of Deseret

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,660
digital media I'm curious

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,240
or a few okay I bet if you're from Utah

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,939
you've heard of ksl.com I hope

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,780
um and we also own and operate a company

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,640
called utah.com so if you're not from

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,180
Utah come visit us at utah.com and find

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,879
some fun adventures of things to do

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,340
but we are as a whole Deseret digital

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,860
media KSL TV and radio are sister

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,920
companies but we run ksl.com

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,620
okay who am I as I said my name is Brian

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,219
Hoops uh I've been working as in the

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,620
developer field for 20 plus years I

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,820
started out at the Salt Lake School

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,219
District so it's great for all of the

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,860
uen folks that got me through college

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,659
when I finished College I went and

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,720
worked at KSL as a developer and have

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,760
been there ever since so many years

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,040
there most of the time as a developer

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,439
our manager I've been CSO for a little

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,500
more than a year at DDM so

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
that's who I am

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,720
what this talk is so what we are going

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,420
to talk a little bit about is some of

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,759
the lessons I've learned along the way

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,520
uh not necessarily technical lessons but

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,400
things that have changed my perspective

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
as we've gone or as I've gone through

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,140
the path

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,880
what this talk is not this is not a

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,340
blueprint of how to become a CSO

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,299
um

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,420
I fully believe that that path is going

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,820
to be pretty individual and that's

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,380
something that you'll need to find your

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,680
own path but and mine is fairly unique

48
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,119
along the way but what what I will say

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,100
is get involved in security be it

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,399
incidents be it just saying hey have you

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,159
thought about this security wise are you

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,840
sure you want to put that into

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
production those kinds of things but

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
that that's about all I'm going to say

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,319
on the technical side

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,680
so the preface here it's about people if

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,780
you want to become a CSO you can be as

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,040
technical as you want but if you can't

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,080
get along with people it's not going to

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
work

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,459
um you can try it but it's not going to

62
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,940
work very well

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,440
so let's start out with a couple of

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,260
points of

65
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,300
things I've learned along the way

66
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,099
and we're going to look at these from a

67
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,959
developer point of view a manager point

68
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,480
of view on the CSO point of view so my

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
scrum scrum routes are going to come out

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,379
and I'm going to use the word clout a

71
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,560
very scrummy term but uh as a developer

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,660
you need to create really relationships

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,959
with your team and get their trust

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,739
as a manager you need the trust of your

75
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,239
team and sometimes the teams you work

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,040
with

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,160
um

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,060
and sometimes you'll work in between

79
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,940
teams but really it's getting the trust

80
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,920
of your team and those above you and

81
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,840
those around you

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,659
as a very young manager my boss pulled

83
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,000
me aside and he said Hoops you're grumpy

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,860
you've got to be nicer to the other

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,099
teams this isn't working

86
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,659
and I will say that was one of the low

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,300
points of my jobs what did I do I went

88
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,340
away and I reflected on it and I came

89
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,599
back to my boss and I was like what are

90
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,700
you talking about I'm I'm just trying to

91
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,280
get things done I I you know have my

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,260
heads down if I tell people no it's

93
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,379
because well no and

94
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,099
um

95
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm just trying to get through my very

96
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,640
long to-do list at this point I was

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,500
managing the KSL Classifieds team we had

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,860
four or five engineers and we had a lot

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,299
to do

100
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,560
um and he came back to me and he said

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
oops this is what I want you to do I

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,580
want you to go chit chat with the

103
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,799
product owners for five minutes a day

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,560
that's all I want just go talk to him

105
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,840
and I was like I got other things to do

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
he's like oops Do It

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
um so away I went and I would go over

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
their cubicles and chit chat with them

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,760
and kind of make small talk and

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,040
amazingly those concerns went away I

111
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
have no idea who went to my boss and

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,940
told him I was grumpy but I will tell

113
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,760
you that the Chit Chat and the small

114
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,100
people things will gain you that clout

115
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,340
to be able to get you

116
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,199
to a point that people trust you and

117
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,419
will listen to you

118
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,780
as a CSO you are expected to manage the

119
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,220
risk for the company

120
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,259
and all have to trust what you're going

121
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,820
to say but so you have to have the clout

122
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,800
within the company and you have to build

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,320
it and make it make it work

124
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,720
okay

125
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,759
oops too far

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,740
words and tone this kind of Builds on

127
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,139
the clout

128
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,120
um

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,979
when you're talking to your individual

130
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,199
team

131
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,300
they understand you you talk to them a

132
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,460
lot every day

133
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,020
um and if you say the wrong thing it's

134
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,199
not usually a big deal and and they just

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,759
kind of get over it or they'll say hey

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,540
man that's not cool

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,240
as a manager the things you say

138
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,740
um are typically to people you work with

139
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,419
they're not always going to give you

140
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,660
feedback and you communicate enough with

141
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,919
them that hopefully if you say something

142
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,800
wrong that's not going to become a huge

143
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
problem

144
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,960
as a CSO when you speak people typically

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,940
listen

146
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,160
if you say the wrong thing or push too

147
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,139
hard then they're going to get offended

148
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,000
and you're probably not going to hear

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,860
about it directly from them that's

150
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,479
probably going to come back through the

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
grapevine and somebody's just going to

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,720
say hey you said this to them how could

153
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,479
you do that and and you have no idea and

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,979
you think oh my goodness what did I do

155
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,320
and then you have to try and repair that

156
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,560
so even the wrong tone can sometimes get

157
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,199
get you in the wrong spot

158
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,960
I will say over the years I've learned

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,759
that I reflect on conversations

160
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,560
especially difficult conversations I'll

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
reflect on them and I'll I'll think

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,580
about them and I'll think gee maybe that

163
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,080
didn't go right maybe they didn't get

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
the right message maybe I pushed too

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,660
hard

166
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,919
um and so I'll actually Circle back

167
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
around with them some of my teams here

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,460
they've probably gotten this from from

169
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,960
me before

170
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,780
um and I'll go back to him and say hey I

171
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,940
didn't mean to offend you I was just

172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,000
trying to express a point are we good

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,380
and usually they'll say no no we're good

174
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,300
and that kind of fixes some of those

175
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,880
words and tone issues and often

176
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,699
especially when I'm just thinking out

177
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,979
loud I'll preface my thoughts with hey

178
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm thinking here don't take this as

179
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,180
what I want or what I'm telling you to

180
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,100
do let's just talk about this and that

181
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,720
kind of lowers the barriers a little bit

182
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,979
from

183
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,900
um from me coming in and saying hey guys

184
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,819
this is what we need to do

185
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,759
and as we've gone to remote DDM is

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,860
nearly fully remote at this point we

187
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,340
call it hybrid uh but uh we don't see

188
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,960
each other face to face quite as much

189
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,300
but that's changed this Dynamic a lot we

190
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,160
talk through chat we talk through email

191
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,639
we talk through zoom and sometimes if

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
you're not assuming the right intention

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,060
you can come away with the really wrong

194
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,800
message and so you have to be very

195
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,259
careful about that you have to

196
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,580
um

197
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,740
really reflect on those conversations

198
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,060
and when you need to go back and fix

199
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,919
something do it and do it quickly

200
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,960
because if people confess her on things

201
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,818
it's not going to be a great situation

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
okay let's talk about wearing the

203
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,979
company hat

204
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,960
and that's kind of a strange thing but

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,259
uh it will make sense I promise

206
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,460
get to the right notes Here

207
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,620
so as a developer you see things from

208
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,240
the point of view of the task you're

209
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,720
working on right so as a developer I was

210
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
just heads down trying to get through

211
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,380
things we needed to release things we

212
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,960
had tons to do so I was just pushing

213
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,419
forward and I saw things and I would

214
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,400
push back on things from the point of

215
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
view of the task at hand or the product

216
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,160
or feature we were trying to work on

217
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,199
as a manager you see things from the

218
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,479
point of view that affects your team and

219
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,460
what's important to them right so you

220
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,319
try and get rid of roadblocks you try

221
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,240
and push back on the things that you

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,460
know aren't going to work so well

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,259
um and and you take things from the

224
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,840
point of view of

225
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,180
um the products and the the features

226
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,400
that you're working on

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,199
and you also have to try and help your

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,059
team understand how those things fit

229
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,740
into the company vision and hopefully

230
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,479
you're getting that from from those

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,880
above you

232
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,120
as a CSO you must see things from the

233
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
point of view of the entire company

234
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,200
sometimes you have to find the balance

235
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,899
between competing views I will always

236
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:49,820
remember

237
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,080
a few years ago talking to the president

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,779
of the company at the time and saying

239
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,820
hey from a technical point of view this

240
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,760
is really not a good place to be and him

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,560
saying from this other point of view

242
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,720
this is where we need to be so where's

243
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,640
the balance and I said yes but I'm

244
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,839
thinking about this from a technical

245
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,240
point of view and he said Hoops wear the

246
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,860
company hat you have to look at this

247
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,839
from a company point of view we have to

248
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,420
find the balance right now we're working

249
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,940
through some things where from a

250
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,560
security standpoint we see things one

251
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,600
way and in other team season things

252
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,399
another way I was just talking to my

253
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,140
boss about this and he didn't come in

254
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,600
and say this is how it is he said go

255
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
work with them figure it out so that's

256
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,500
where it comes in you have to wear the

257
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
company hat and you have to change your

258
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,399
point of view of what's best for the

259
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,820
company rather than what's best and how

260
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,040
card set for this particular thing

261
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,220
security has hard set rules but often it

262
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,260
comes down to finding that balance and

263
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,500
figuring out how to figure out

264
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,360
the best way to make it work and the

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,200
balance between things

266
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,220
okay can you say I don't know the

267
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,080
questions and this is kind of a strange

268
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,600
thing it's another interesting point of

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,980
view change as you go

270
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,600
as a developer you are the expert right

271
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,640
you wrote the code you know what's going

272
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,800
on you know how it interacts hopefully

273
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,740
with other things and years later you're

274
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,300
still getting blamed for that code you

275
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,399
wrote so you know how it goes I was

276
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,480
actually talking to a guy I worked with

277
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,860
the school district today he's like hey

278
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,540
we finally retired that thing and I was

279
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,339
like that's 20 years ago that shouldn't

280
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,899
have been still still alive

281
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,600
as a manager you ensure your team knows

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
the details and you understand the basic

283
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,320
concepts but you're probably not going

284
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,660
to be in the code anymore I spent a lot

285
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,399
of time in code and that caused some

286
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,320
problems because I was trying to be

287
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,540
heads down yet manage a team and as my

288
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,399
team got larger that that was nearly

289
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,720
impossible

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
but you can't know all of what your

291
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,740
teams are working on

292
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,160
so I will always I remember a time that

293
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
I was talking to my dotted line boss our

294
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,459
VP of product

295
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,200
and he's like hey Hoops how does this

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,740
work and I was like uh

297
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,120
uh and I just kind of sat there for a

298
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,279
minute and he's like well I was like I

299
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,899
don't know and it really bugs me that I

300
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,220
don't know but I don't know I need to go

301
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,899
talk to somebody he's like oops you

302
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,100
can't know everything go find out and

303
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,019
come back and tell me but it was one of

304
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,140
those things that I had shifted from a

305
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,060
developer to a manager and then I didn't

306
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,380
know everything and that really bugged

307
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,940
me because I knew how everything worked

308
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,519
at one point I knew how ksl.com worked

309
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,200
head to toe I could tell you everything

310
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
these days not so much

311
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,300
so you can't know all of what your teams

312
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,500
are working on

313
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,079
as a CSO there's no chance you're going

314
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,240
to know what things are working on you

315
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,680
have to come at it from a point of view

316
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,540
of asking the right questions at the

317
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,940
right time I spent a lot of time in

318
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,880
product reviews and just kind of

319
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,800
observing what's going on and every once

320
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,480
in a while in those product reviews I'll

321
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,459
say hey have you thought about this or

322
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,140
I'll Circle back around with some post

323
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,300
meeting and say hey we should look at

324
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,000
this can you give me some time to go

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,040
into that and we'll go back but you can

326
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,899
only know the global Concepts you can

327
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,399
only know the big things of what your

328
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,100
team's working on but you also know who

329
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,980
to go talk to if there's an issue heaven

330
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,240
forbid there's an incident with a

331
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,579
product you really need to go and talk

332
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,040
to those people and and you've got to

333
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
know who it is and you got to have that

334
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,660
clout so they'll listen to you

335
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,140
hey

336
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
okay

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,420
doing well

338
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,700
so this happened to me about a year ago

339
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,660
you're a new CSO now what uh my boss

340
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,000
referred to me as a security blanket for

341
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,260
a short time he's like hey Hoops you're

342
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,540
the security blanket for DDM uh I'm so

343
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,100
happy to have you here and it's like oh

344
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,040
great just what I need so

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,779
the first thing you need to do is get to

346
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,459
know the other leaders I'm on the senior

347
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,680
senior leadership team you have to get

348
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,180
to know those other leaders really well

349
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,740
because those are the people you're

350
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,079
going to clash with and the president of

351
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
the company or CEO or whoever your boss

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,620
is probably isn't going to come in and

353
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,019
say this is the way they'll say go

354
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,820
figure it out with those people so you

355
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
got to get to know them you got to make

356
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,980
those bonds I will also say as a CSO

357
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,200
life's Lonely at the Top you don't get a

358
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,760
whole lot of positive feedback nobody's

359
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,200
high-fiving you hey we haven't had an

360
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,740
incident today the only time you get uh

361
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,139
hear from people is hey you really

362
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,380
screwed this up or hey what's up with

363
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,820
this incident

364
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,399
um and so though the people you can

365
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,019
really talk to and open up with are

366
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,760
those on that leadership team and those

367
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,519
your direct peers so get to know those

368
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,680
people and I will very much say clout

369
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,959
matters here too if those folks think

370
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,000
that you're not the smartest tool in the

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,800
shed then you got a lot of problems and

372
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,959
you got to figure that out

373
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,060
do you understand your company's risk

374
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,360
appetite so ksl.com has ownership right

375
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,420
and we are somewhat risk averse so we do

376
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,040
things a little differently than some

377
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,279
other companies do because we avoid that

378
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,500
risk as best we can and there are often

379
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,360
times as I said I'll be sitting in

380
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,100
product reviews and I'll chime in and

381
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,500
say hey the liability on that's kind of

382
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
interesting it's it's probably not

383
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,380
horrible but we need to think about that

384
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,720
and and it's understanding that

385
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,279
company's risk appetite and it will be

386
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,680
different for every company and if your

387
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,720
company doesn't know what that is you

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,040
need to figure it out with the other

389
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,200
senior leaders to know what's going on

390
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,959
and know how to get past that

391
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,779
do security policies exist

392
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,300
right for a long time when we were a

393
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,940
relatively small shop and yes castle.com

394
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,700
when I started there there were two

395
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,060
developers handling all of KSL were a

396
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,980
little bit larger now

397
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,600
um but uh but we had policies that uh

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,399
were

399
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,440
weren't exactly written they were just

400
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,300
known right you talked about it you talk

401
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,600
you know hey boss this is what I'm doing

402
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,100
and they say oh that's that's not great

403
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,839
you need to look at it from this way

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,940
so are your security policies written

405
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,980
down the other question is does anybody

406
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,579
know that they exist and where they are

407
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,000
um I know I will often tell Folks at DDM

408
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,139
my favorite thing to do is write

409
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,060
policies I kind of avoid it but it's

410
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,160
something that's that's very necessary

411
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
and needed

412
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,660
the next thing to do is turn on the

413
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,160
lights if you haven't had a formal

414
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,899
security process or

415
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,180
you or you don't know what's going on

416
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,040
within your company you got to turn on

417
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,139
the lights and take a peek you're going

418
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,079
to find things that aren't so super but

419
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,540
you need to know that they're there so

420
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,519
you can then mitigate them and you got

421
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,139
to work with the folks and that's where

422
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,639
that clout comes in so they'll actually

423
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,480
tell you that those things are out there

424
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,940
and we have enough fun times when you're

425
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,380
like oh I didn't know that website was

426
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,120
there where did that come from and that

427
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,680
was just they didn't they didn't

428
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
remember it or they didn't remember to

429
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,680
tell you but if they're hiding things

430
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,540
from you you're never going to find them

431
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,279
so having that cloud to turn on the

432
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,000
lights and know what's crawling around

433
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,860
is very important

434
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,940
the last big point is you can't do

435
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,399
everything at once right so you come in

436
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,480
and you're like oh we need to implement

437
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,279
this framework we need to do right

438
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
teaming we need to do pen testing we

439
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,420
need to do code reviews we've got to get

440
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,920
all of the engineers trained we've got

441
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,360
to get the rest of the company fishing

442
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,980
trained we got to do all this stuff

443
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,380
right if you come at it from that point

444
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,300
of view it's not going to be a fun time

445
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,160
you got to start somewhere you got to

446
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,779
figure out where that risk appetite is

447
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,660
and start working towards things

448
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,360
I will say that we've had a lot of time

449
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,399
a lot of fun

450
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,959
um doing pen testing on some of our

451
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
products and then we noticed some

452
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,060
patterns and this last week we did an

453
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,820
internal CTF with our teams and had a

454
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,860
lot of fun with them and and not only

455
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,540
did we get to build some fun challenges

456
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,120
but they also got to to learn some of

457
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,220
the things and seeing how they reacted

458
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,959
to those challenges also tells us where

459
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,759
we need to go from there so start

460
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,680
interacting with those teams figure out

461
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,779
what's going on

462
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,480
and know how to help them and you know

463
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,160
if you try something and it doesn't work

464
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,319
well try something else we learned a lot

465
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,819
of lessons from our CTF we'll probably

466
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,859
do it again next year and change things

467
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,540
up to make it a little better for folks

468
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,540
so it's always an iterative iterative

469
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,480
process if I can say that word

470
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,699
awesome

471
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,480
any questions

472
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
you're quiet

473
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,600
sure

474
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,780
um I think it's just getting involved in

475
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,940
voicing the things and maybe I I think I

476
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,260
understand your question if I don't tell

477
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,360
me and we'll figure it out

478
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,320
um

479
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,760
it's so I will say from the beginning I

480
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,500
was kind of known as a security guy

481
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,480
right when we'd have minor incidents

482
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,280
there were a few of us that would come

483
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,220
in gather around Chase it down figure it

484
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,720
out we didn't really have a formal

485
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,980
security process

486
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,380
and from that point people kind of knew

487
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,520
you and they'd come talk to you and

488
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,559
you'd voice those things one word of

489
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,539
caution there is you can't be the only

490
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,640
security person like you can't only talk

491
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,260
about security because then you become

492
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,539
that guy right that that squeaky wheel

493
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,520
and it's something to be honest I try to

494
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,980
avoid in my role right that is my job

495
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,500
that is my role I do think a lot about

496
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,960
security but if if I walk up to somebody

497
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,820
and they think immediately oh Hoops is

498
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,380
going to talk to me about security it's

499
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,020
not not so super but I will say get

500
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,039
involved

501
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:38,640
um

502
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,620
really what ended me up in this position

503
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,900
was we had a minor incident and I went

504
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,480
to my boss and I said hey we we're big

505
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,100
enough we need somebody looking at

506
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,600
security I don't know what the title is

507
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,580
I don't know how it fits in I don't even

508
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,340
know if it's me but we need this and for

509
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,720
a few years it kind of went through the

510
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,980
circles

511
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,799
um and then finally uh we were getting a

512
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,559
new CTO I was very involved in that

513
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,140
process I didn't get the CTO role but I

514
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,820
was offered the role of CSO at the time

515
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,400
so that's kind of how that came out so

516
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,880
if if you make yourself known and it

517
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,380
really depends on the company you're at

518
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,919
but you know I've been at DDM or KSL for

519
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,840
a long time and and they kind of knew me

520
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,640
as a security person so when that role

521
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,679
became a thing

522
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,260
um they put me in it

523
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,360
does that answer your question

524
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,120
yep any other questions true

525
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,720
yeah it's a lot of fun

526
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,840
um I use a lot of examples

527
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,880
um non-tech examples

528
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
um just try to get people to see that

529
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,440
point of view

530
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,200
and as you said it's a lot of fun

531
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,480
um but uh and sometimes it's you know

532
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,280
boiling it down to the smallest thing

533
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,480
and kind of building out from there

534
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
years ago

535
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,340
are are then president of the company

536
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,260
talked about what's known as the latter

537
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
of inference which this is getting into

538
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,940
really random business principles but

539
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,059
the idea is if you're both on a ladder

540
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,160
you're above or below each other and you

541
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,140
can't you can't communicate above or

542
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,280
below each other so you have to go to

543
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,020
the very bottom and then you can build

544
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,179
up from there together so that's kind of

545
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,700
the the process that we use

546
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,020
any other questions sure

547
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,539
that's a great question

548
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,679
um I will say uh for us

549
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:41,400
um

550
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
we work a lot with our customer service

551
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,780
team so we do not only security but

552
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,039
fraud

553
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,080
um which which opens that up all the

554
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,600
more and fraud prevention so we work a

555
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,460
lot with our customer experience folks

556
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,860
they're the front lines on the fraud so

557
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,780
we we actually measure a lot of stuff

558
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,160
from them

559
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,820
um

560
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,039
you know as we mature and we're really

561
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,600
young in the security process we're

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,520
looking at the Frameworks right so right

563
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
now we're going through the CIS

564
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,000
framework

565
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,860
um just to see where we are and how that

566
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,179
goes we're doing that with our parent

567
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,700
company and looking at the others

568
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,620
um but we're I will admit we're pretty

569
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,059
young in that

570
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,379
um and and we need to grow

571
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,360
and you know the other part of that is

572
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,500
you got to be honest with yourself

573
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,539
sometimes right so

574
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,640
um I think right about now my boss is in

575
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,860
the board meeting and he's told me every

576
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,659
board meeting he wants a slide on on

577
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,840
fraud and security so I've I provide him

578
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,080
with that giving him some information

579
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,179
and you know we'll see if if they ever

580
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,640
come back wanting more but up until now

581
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
they're they're pretty happy with the

582
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
progress we've made we're not perfect

583
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,220
but but we're making progress

584
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,820
sure

585
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,939
yep

586
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,158
to my knowledge

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,260
nobody's hiding anything from us

588
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,260
but but I can tell you

589
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,220
um

590
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,580
it as recently as as a month ago uh we

591
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,020
were in a conversation and somebody

592
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,559
mentioned renewing a site

593
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,960
um and that caught my ear and a lot of

594
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
things catch my ear and I circled

595
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,500
background I was like what what site is

596
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,520
that

597
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,659
um and they're like oh it's this random

598
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,100
website that we use on utah.com and I

599
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,480
was like oh I had no idea that was there

600
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,039
we should we should look more into that

601
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,900
but uh

602
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,600
um I don't think anybody's hiding

603
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
anything from us

604
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,039
I hope we'll find it maybe

605
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,520
yes

606
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,340
yep

607
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,399
yep

608
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,299
yeah

609
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:57,960
so

610
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,179
um we we started doing a lot of that

611
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,400
with our internal pen tests

612
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,100
um just documenting what's out there V

613
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,640
hosts on the sites what IPS are where we

614
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,980
work a lot with our our platform team

615
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,400
our it guys and the web guys as we go

616
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,159
through but it's definitely a constantly

617
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,900
evolving thing

618
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,340
um you know I was on a review yesterday

619
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,960
hey we put up this website so we could

620
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,940
check these things and I was like oh

621
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,280
yet another one to add to the list right

622
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
so uh it's definitely a constantly

623
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,780
evolving thing I think as we mature

624
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,520
um we'll probably start automating what

625
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,559
V hosts are out there and and looking at

626
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,940
it from that way

627
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,679
um and as we move to the cloud maybe

628
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,880
that will become easier we'll see

629
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,820
sure

630
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,600
yeah

631
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,159
yep

632
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:53,720
yep

633
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,580
so grumpy hoops right I still joke about

634
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,840
that

635
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,460
um

636
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,059
and it takes time right but but I think

637
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,520
one something we do at DDM is we

638
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,900
recognize that people are people they're

639
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,640
not just co-workers right so we spend

640
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,400
some time outside of the company and you

641
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,539
know coming out of the last couple years

642
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,919
it's been more difficult but we're

643
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,380
starting to do more company events

644
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,480
um I will tell you I am very introverted

645
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,700
I will happily sit next to somebody and

646
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,159
not say a word to them forever

647
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,039
um now that that doesn't really mesh

648
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,600
with the clout and repairing

649
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,820
relationship things so if you know a

650
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,260
little bit about somebody you can kind

651
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,419
of build on that and you know try to see

652
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,299
eye to eye you know I've burned more

653
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,340
bridges than I'd like to admit

654
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,440
um but we've kind of come past it and it

655
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,900
takes time but you know Chit Chat is is

656
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,460
an amazing thing

657
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,280
um and really we do what we call get to

658
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,360
know yous

659
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,460
um so if you pay attention to those uh

660
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,020
it tell us about people's lives what

661
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,940
they like uh favorite thing to ask is

662
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,500
what's your favorite food

663
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,120
um but but those kind of things really

664
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,240
do build build that relationship again

665
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
there's yeah

666
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,100
um that goes back to we recognize people

667
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,980
are people and not just co-workers right

668
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,520
um

669
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
there are a few from my team here and

670
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,039
they'll tell you that uh I you know if

671
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,659
they work late I'll tell them take a

672
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,780
couple hours off right so we need to be

673
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,820
sharp in case there is an incident and I

674
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,220
will ask them to work 24 7 until we get

675
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,020
through it and I think they understand

676
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,179
that but uh but you know if if we are

677
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,620
working a little late on something then

678
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,179
we'll we'll take some time and get away

679
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,120
and we also try to do you know monthly

680
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,799
lunches just to get away and we don't

681
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,039
maybe talk about work usually not

682
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,799
um but but those are the points to a

683
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,419
rebuild those bridges make sure you have

684
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,700
those relationships but it also

685
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,419
um

686
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,880
gets rid of some of that burnout and and

687
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,100
