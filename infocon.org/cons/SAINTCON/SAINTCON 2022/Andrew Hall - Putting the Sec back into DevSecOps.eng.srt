1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
my name is Andrew Hall

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,360
I'm currently a professor of cyber

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,880
security at Dau which is the defense

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,799
acquisition University it's a federal

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,019
University within the Department of

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,880
Defense

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,340
and I'm mainly Focus within doing

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,560
software Assurance credentials and

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,140
aspects within teaching the acquisition

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,000
work for cyber security

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,260
I'm going to be talking about putting

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,019
the SEC back into devsecops and this

13
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,480
will be pre-introductory on what drives

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,300
security and devs take Ops and into your

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,800
software development life cycle

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,620
foreign

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,680
q a session questions I'll be going over

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,040
what is devsecops for the future

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,500
preparing for the future going into the

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,320
security of embedded in Secure embedded

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,360
into devsecops going through security

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,340
principles that are needed in software

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,500
development life cycle how to get

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,180
security integrated into your agile

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,579
principles graduate teams

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,400
to get started what is devsecops

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,159
like this is the term that comes from

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,500
devops and what is devops it's

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,200
development and operations going through

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,140
often shown in an Infinity model like

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,159
this

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,740
but devastating Ops is not devops plus

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,619
security or Security Plus devops it

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,180
needs to be more than that it needs to

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,619
be more Incorporated

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,280
going through

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
as we go through development that's part

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,720
of a factory A system that I'll talk

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,540
through often and operations with

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,360
another system your development is

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
like Engineers developing making a car

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,600
it's the ones that doing the

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,060
the actual work of making your product

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
into it while your operations or your

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,500
pipeline your automation parts of your

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,720
scanning and getting the code goes

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,040
through like an automotive Factory

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,140
producing the making the car from

49
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,100
delivery to your customer

50
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,439
I've

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,300
this is the comic I like

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,120
that goes through

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,800
dealing with chip left shift left is a

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,360
term that's often used

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,180
and heard into it that we need to move

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,080
shift security left Within devops

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,819
to make a Dev psychops and everything

58
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,040
else but what does that really mean as

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,360
this how it goes is that they couldn't

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,580
afford a devops team there's a lot of

61
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,800
accuracy in that because devops should

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
have already included security and a lot

63
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,640
of other aspects into it if they do it

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,800
right it shouldn't need to be a term of

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,020
devs take-ups even to begin with

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,000
so we go through

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
oh the process of everything

68
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,720
it's it's kind of a misnomer with it I

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
have a another slide that deals with

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,360
shift left as well after this one if you

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,459
go through that it's so common to use

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,519
it's almost become pointless in use into

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,959
it as

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
security needs to be

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
embedded in and properly Incorporated

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
like you do with any other Dev apps

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,480
processes going

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,840
into agile and your development software

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,519
development life cycle

80
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,239
other aspects of another fun meme that

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,700
people use

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,319
it's not devops with security shift to

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,360
the left and there's lots of aspects to

84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,659
it devops started kind of in Terms early

85
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,360
2000 but really came out in the 70s

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,239
well devsecops is more recent with the

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,760
devsecups manifesto and everything else

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,340
do you go through and a lot of it deals

89
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,739
with silos and everything else is this

90
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,840
keywords that people use and go through

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,760
and it's not great

92
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,400
to to keep using terms over and over

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
without any emphasis to actually make it

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,140
better improve upon your processes

95
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,120
so it doesn't matter if it's one or 15

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
years or anything else just don't use

97
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,220
terms to kind of allude to make things

98
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
better instead of actually doing process

99
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,700
to make it better

100
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,819
a lot of that deals with silos

101
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,560
probably no one here has ever been in a

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,780
company that has silos that's probably

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,140
unheard of right in these days uh I wish

104
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,180
that would be a true statement

105
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,339
almost any company you get into will

106
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,858
have their silos their legacy groups or

107
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,019
anything else and silos can be in many

108
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,660
different forms as groups get busy and

109
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,759
over tasked they also become their own

110
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,080
Silo into it this comic is great in that

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,240
they knew this organization was full of

112
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,340
silos they just didn't know how heavily

113
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,259
defended they were a lot of

114
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,120
organizations have heavily defended

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,199
silos

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,020
either inadvertently or overently they

117
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,960
do it and it's a bad practice I mean you

118
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
get rid of it

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,979
so what should take Ops be or any other

120
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,740
type of devops in reality needs to be

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,020
cross-functional teams you need to have

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,419
teams that help each other have the

123
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,699
right expertise in your development

124
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,160
teams and your operations teams that can

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,220
handle the issues hand you handles a the

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,080
problems that they arise without having

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,259
to rely and go to different groups and

128
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,180
hit roadblocks

129
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,740
into it

130
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,460
get into some other aspects of lean and

131
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,100
other process oriented philosophies that

132
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,039
really apply into software as well is

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
that they use different terms and you

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,419
just have to

135
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,800
reevaluate them in and translate them

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
into the right terminology to make them

137
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,180
relevant within your groups that's kind

138
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,300
of a big part and you have to integrate

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,360
security and cyber security into the

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,860
groups I'll be talking later about

141
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,360
software assurance

142
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,479
and that rule which is a big term other

143
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,280
people use different terminologies for

144
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,919
that same type of role need to be

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,199
transparent we need to not keep things

146
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,440
hidden and behind walls of

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
they just can't have access to or don't

148
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,840
understand why they have to do these

149
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,280
changes or anything else we need to be

150
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,539
better at that

151
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,000
get continuous updating making sure

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
we're staying relevant in our scans and

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,220
our knowledge and our technology

154
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,039
be adaptable we shouldn't be become

155
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,360
stagnant

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,620
and stuck in a process in a way

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,440
probably the worst is when you start

158
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,419
going down and then group scale over

159
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,819
tasks and they put their heads down and

160
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,860
they end up becoming siled themselves

161
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
because they stop taking input and

162
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,600
providing input to others and that's an

163
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
inadvertent Silo that happens you might

164
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,699
not think is a silo but it is because it

165
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,759
then produces roadblocks and stoppage

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,860
within your devsec Ops or your devops

167
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,720
flows that Infinity model should be

168
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,780
consistent be able to keep flowing you

169
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,880
need to not have any breaks or

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
transitions within it

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,979
which is why I like

172
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,620
this diagram of an Infinity model that's

173
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,220
done by SEI they got out there and that

174
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,199
security really isn't another system

175
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,400
being added into your devops environment

176
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,020
it's really being encapsulated

177
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,139
integrated within everything that you do

178
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,060
as you go into it these are just some

179
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,680
examples of different parts that can go

180
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
in different aspects of your devops

181
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,199
environments but in reality this will

182
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
all go into how you do your user stories

183
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,220
how you how you deal with your

184
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,520
requirements how you build up your

185
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
your development teams

186
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,340
and build up on

187
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
what you really need to produce secure

188
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,639
software and secure environments

189
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,919
which gets into

190
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,220
another great comic that relates both to

191
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,199
IIT security and engineering and many

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,599
other aspects

193
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,419
government and Industry you often might

194
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,699
hear some of these turns laugh about

195
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,039
them go in with them

196
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,380
and that's a small change let's do it in

197
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,900
production it doesn't matter or they

198
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,419
don't have to learn new things or

199
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,220
backups

200
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,039
repository duplicates they are needed to

201
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,560
go through we don't need to do scripts

202
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,720
we don't need to automate aspects

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,539
to make things better I know it I can do

204
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,120
it I I have the job secure because I'm

205
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,819
the expert in it it's not great there's

206
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,520
great resources to help you get good

207
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,199
Frameworks and this has the secure

208
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,360
software development framework

209
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,820
then there's building security

210
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,059
maturation model that's out there Cas

211
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,000
mainly control 16. the CIS group does a

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,740
great job of taking requirements from

213
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,240
other groups and kind of making them a

214
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
little bit readable for organizations

215
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,160
especially industry to get into

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,560
understanding the security aspects of

217
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,740
controls and uh think on Discord we have

218
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,540
a CIS channel that goes through each

219
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,700
control which would be nice to see some

220
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,200
more communication with and questions

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,720
asked amongst people to kind of share

222
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
information kind of break down that Silo

223
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,760
even what's on us between Industries and

224
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,740
between our expertise and start sharing

225
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,040
information with it then there's oau Sam

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,380
that goes with agile and then there's a

227
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,940
government swap study

228
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,820
that came out

229
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,560
in the swap city is the software

230
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,620
acquisition and practices a study that

231
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,260
the defense Innovation board did and

232
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,180
went through and gave some aspects of

233
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,000
improving software or software

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,580
development and acquisition strategies

235
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,519
these are all available and usually

236
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,560
freely able to get into them great

237
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,899
resources to go into

238
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,120
the Linux Foundation also has some

239
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,240
training out there for developing secure

240
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,940
software

241
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,519
many Great Courses lots of time that you

242
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,100
can do for internal on-the-job training

243
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,200
and other aspects or if you're building

244
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,399
your own

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,440
framework your own devops teams

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
environments we're trying to improve

247
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,980
yours I recommend going out and looking

248
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,300
at a few different

249
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Frameworks out there standards

250
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,720
recommendations

251
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,060
to see how it can help you become a

252
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,779
better at making secure software

253
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,980
I think it's into a key term that I

254
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,860
really like which is software assurance

255
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,980
often misunderstood on what it is a lot

256
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,300
of people might think that software

257
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
quality assurance

258
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,500
but really it deals with security and

259
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,620
this is a definition from the committee

260
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,220
on National Security System cnss

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,220
and instruction number 4009 from the

262
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,320
national information Insurance glossary

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,899
that's love of confidence that software

264
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,540
is free from vulnerabilities either

265
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,880
intentionally designed into the software

266
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,820
or accidentally inserted at any time

267
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,040
during the life cycle now the software

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
functions as intended in the intended

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,959
manner that's a big thing

270
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,940
how many of you

271
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,060
test for the full confidence

272
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,820
confidence that your software works as

273
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,700
designed both

274
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,519
from accidental insertion as well as

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,500
intentional surface

276
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,440
it's tough to go into all the aspects

277
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
that go into

278
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,060
fully testing software to make sure it

279
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,100
runs how it should your software should

280
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,959
be able to run in any environment a

281
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,940
compromised or perfect environment

282
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,399
should not matter for your software to

283
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,019
be run in and that kind of gets into

284
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,300
zero trust and some of these other

285
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,120
keywords are coming out and that it's

286
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,779
really about making tools that run in a

287
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,980
compromise or degraded environment but

288
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,839
knowing for sure that it will function

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,700
as intended

290
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
so no matter what environment you throw

291
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
your software in you should be able to

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
be confident that it is mature and able

293
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,839
to be

294
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,660
secure as we go into

295
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,120
other aspects the government has lots of

296
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,500
different groups that have a little bit

297
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,019
different definitions

298
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,940
within software Assurance so the

299
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,560
Department of Homeland Security just

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,180
deals with trustworthiness predictable

301
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,000
execution in conformance and then the

302
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,320
dod

303
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,899
as a unique aspect they have sound

304
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,180
system engineering practices

305
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,880
that's a unique thing to think about is

306
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,019
that if you have sound system

307
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,360
engineering that means you have

308
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,640
good practices on making things better

309
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,899
good feedback good requirements flows

310
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,220
and aspects within your software

311
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,680
development life cycle to improve and

312
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,500
build upon NASA really blows out the

313
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,800
definition to branching out into gain

314
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,420
the safety assurance and security

315
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,180
assurance and quality assurance and many

316
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,920
of those aspects

317
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,720
as you deal with quality assurance

318
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,940
that's probably what most of you deal

319
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,639
with with people making sure that your

320
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,700
code Works to the basics for the

321
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,740
requirements and everything like that

322
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,500
but when you get into some highly

323
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,320
sensitive projects that deal with life

324
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,139
and death safety becomes an issue in

325
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,639
other aspects and security should just

326
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,860
be right in there with it be fully

327
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,560
transparent and integrated into it

328
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
and not be something new and unique for

329
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,899
many of these software developers or

330
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,120
factories or devsecops groups to deal

331
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
with in the nist

332
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,980
goes in with the semante project which

333
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,440
may or may not still be around

334
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,899
to help achieve trustworthiness and

335
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,820
predictable execution

336
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,680
we should have predictable executioner

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,980
code be able to rely and Trust on our

338
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,899
devops and devsecops environments

339
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,980
you go further into how to get embedded

340
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,500
into devsecops uh the non-government

341
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,820
entities that I've been able to find

342
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,860
with it is the object Management Group

343
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,120
OMG

344
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,579
they do justifiable trustworthiness and

345
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,079
media established business and security

346
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,120
objectives it's kind of interesting they

347
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
had business objectives into it so the

348
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
bottom line for business is profit and

349
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,480
making sure that they're able to do

350
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,680
products that they can sell and

351
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,540
everything else kind of interesting

352
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,700
within that and then you got safe code

353
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,160
which is the software Assurance forum

354
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,440
for excellence this kind of aligns a lot

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,139
with the government definitions

356
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,100
that are out there

357
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,779
the big thing is that you have to think

358
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,639
about the whole system

359
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,720
uh

360
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,459
my slides has jumped

361
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,019
secure points

362
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,120
is that everyone is responsible for

363
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,560
security

364
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
it needs to be embedded into every

365
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,019
devsecops team ideally

366
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,579
every single one of your team should

367
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,680
have what I call a software Assurance

368
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,800
liaison someone with some emphasis or

369
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,740
understanding of security

370
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,000
requirements security controls how

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,940
secure coding's done often not taught in

372
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,060
schools and many other aspects and the

373
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,459
job of them is to be put into your agile

374
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,120
teams to help translate requirements and

375
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,100
help the other programmers developers

376
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,160
get educated on making good user stories

377
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,079
Good aspects as I did a webinar of last

378
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,680
month on agile and security some of it

379
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,620
is doing basic user story of I want a

380
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,019
business one in an online app to further

381
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,139
customers to order from so the basic

382
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,120
users for it is I want a an online app

383
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,339
for my customers to do but they miss out

384
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,740
on the security aspect of that and it

385
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,420
really should be I want an online app

386
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,540
that doesn't allow for misuse of the

387
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,160
information my customer does to buy

388
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,260
their product and protect extra

389
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,459
information

390
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,980
it's basically the same user story but

391
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,440
the emphasis is more on how you develop

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,720
it in a more secure way

393
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,820
and the internal tests that deal with it

394
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,380
before they can release it is a little

395
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,480
bit more stringent because they have to

396
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,579
start thinking about ways that their

397
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,820
code might run inadvertently in a bad

398
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,519
manner or hackers or

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,279
people with malicious intent can easily

400
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,680
still suffer them and if you get that

401
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,160
earlier in your process it's much easier

402
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,180
to maintain a secure code base that is

403
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,480
that functions as intended that's what

404
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,980
it's always supposed to do no matter

405
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,800
where it ends up might go into a little

406
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,779
bit different environment but you know

407
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,500
that you have hit these broad areas and

408
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
more confident on it won't be done in

409
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,620
malicious ways we need to customize our

410
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,899
tool sets it's essential we can't just

411
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,180
rely on the basic

412
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,240
Dev psychops philosophy at times where

413
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,620
they bring in these scanning Tools in

414
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,540
this default configurations on their

415
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,899
scans for it so your static code

416
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,060
analysis tools with this have the

417
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,620
default settings on you need to

418
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,420
understand your environments that they

419
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,640
go into and start tailoring them and

420
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,260
customizing some of those scanning

421
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,780
capabilities into your environments

422
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,959
especially on the op side

423
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
and then leadership needs to get trust

424
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,579
in the process team forming and product

425
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,380
owners product owners need to be

426
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,480
educated to make better epics and better

427
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,480
philosophies to guide their agile teams

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
the teams need to be formed with the

429
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
right expertise let it do so forming get

430
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,620
the right people in there if they're

431
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,860
lacking their swallow liaison start

432
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,720
cross getting someone trained within

433
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,940
that team gets mentorship

434
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,120
a lot of bigger organizations should be

435
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,580
able to be able to get a security expert

436
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,860
a little bit more involved that has more

437
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,960
security Focus down into the agile team

438
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,860
as well

439
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,200
startups and smaller organizations that

440
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,480
have more issue might have to do some

441
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,059
more mentoring and where they need some

442
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,160
training and cross training and teaching

443
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,740
down into it do some on-the-job training

444
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,480
to get the people into the right level

445
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,640
and slowly build up their confidence and

446
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,559
go with it it's a it's a big growth

447
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,600
process it's a big dynamic

448
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,880
not very many companies do this

449
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,940
correctly or at all and it's a thing

450
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,080
that needs to be improved upon

451
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,179
so whether the security principles are

452
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,080
needed

453
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,940
there's a lot when you take that

454
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,440
Infinity model and kind of lay it out

455
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,600
you kind of see the basic waterfall

456
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,059
process into it

457
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,160
but there's a lot to it

458
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,460
cyber security needs to be automated

459
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,799
as much as possible and when you think

460
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,980
about the the upside of the aspect

461
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,299
that's your factory

462
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,039
and with and you think about lean

463
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,940
processes and about operations cyber

464
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,500
security and tests and everything else

465
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,080
is considered waste we don't produce

466
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
products we're overhead

467
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,100
business doesn't like us

468
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
because we we just take up money the

469
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,080
point of that is is that we need to be

470
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,179
more embedded into the process and

471
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,919
that's how you remove waste we remove

472
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,080
those robots by getting into the process

473
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,900
into the flow where we have these little

474
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,660
silos that are per in between plan and

475
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,039
development and everything else instead

476
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,559
we're in it automatically we're just

477
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,179
flowing through it so it becomes a

478
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,840
continuous flow like in a normal Factory

479
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,580
if there's a roadblock of a machine

480
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,799
that's taking too long or anything else

481
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,320
they figure out ways of mitigating that

482
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,140
load onto that that bottleneck either

483
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,360
get another machine to help do it which

484
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,179
would be adding breaking off the the

485
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,700
project into different more agile teams

486
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,140
in software

487
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,780
or use different tool sets different

488
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,020
scanning tools how you Branch out for

489
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,580
your pen testing everything else to make

490
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,400
sure that it's a smaller impact on your

491
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,340
total development aspect I'll get into

492
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,100
so that in the future aspects of my

493
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,700
slide of how to get into the CI CD and

494
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,520
get security get into that continuous

495
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,039
integration continuous build where we we

496
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,620
aren't a hindrance on it but it becomes

497
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,860
fluid where we have code that we trust

498
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,399
and go through

499
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,179
and the big points are

500
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,620
you have vulnerabilities getting code

501
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,299
coverage coding standards that's all

502
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,880
your your op side automated you're

503
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,740
trying to those the Security Experts on

504
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,020
your pipeline side need to learn about

505
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,059
your tools get them so they function

506
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,120
properly learn how they can

507
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,179
be more effective of the resources in

508
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,900
the environment to go through and keep

509
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,620
updating standards and best practices as

510
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,280
they go with it not say stringent on Old

511
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,440
practices or old philosophies you need

512
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,799
to be fluid adaptable within it all

513
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,080
and then on the agile side you have to

514
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,200
think of new ways of building your team

515
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
agile has many options many capabilities

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
when done right

517
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,840
when there's a lot of flexibility of how

518
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
you approach it and a lot of companies

519
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,140
don't understand that and kind of just

520
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,000
choose one way and stick to it and it's

521
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,160
like Cookie Cutter processor at all

522
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,679
every team is dynamic every team can be

523
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,880
different

524
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,179
and you have to adapt and do it well

525
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:20,700
stringent processes often revert you

526
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,460
back into waterfall and bad practices

527
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,620
you need to make sure that you continue

528
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,980
to grow and build

529
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,059
on all that you do

530
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,360
that's

531
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,940
kind of a key thing within this comic

532
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,919
that I enjoy is that

533
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,620
many agile programs are great they go

534
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,459
into it but

535
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,780
there's that waterfall again in this

536
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,880
case after five years they're going

537
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,820
circles they aren't actually making

538
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,020
things better

539
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,440
they're just looping back teams change

540
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,780
leadership change the people that are

541
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,940
pioneering your agile process move on

542
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,640
and whatnot and it's not Done Right your

543
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,940
company never really matured your devops

544
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,700
teams never fully got the right way and

545
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,280
go forward so they go back to their old

546
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,080
habits you have your QA devops cubicle

547
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,299
Farms silos that start being built up

548
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,700
again and that's your wonderful process

549
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,340
that is really bad and detrimental to

550
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,640
making fast-paced secure software or any

551
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,659
software

552
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,360
in a secure manner effectively and

553
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,959
quickly

554
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,360
I have worked on some programs where

555
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,600
they're getting into this and they

556
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
they

557
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,000
on the bottom level really hardcore the

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,039
developers are all gung-ho for agile and

559
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
everything else and then go up a few

560
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,240
levels within management and their

561
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,480
definition of agile and the process has

562
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,419
changed when in the government we have

563
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,700
earned value management that doesn't tie

564
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,000
with agile very well so when they start

565
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,820
to try to correlate something as a

566
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,820
metrics in the wrong way because some HR

567
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,980
or business wants something that way it

568
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,380
detriments the agile flow and the growth

569
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,820
that can happen from your Agile

570
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,799
development teams through devops and

571
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,520
devsecops and they've sadly go back to a

572
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
more waterfall flow or add a waterfall

573
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,460
aspect into your your

574
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,980
agile processes that

575
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,539
is sad to see

576
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,299
and as many people per agile there's a

577
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,679
lot of mini waterfalls every Sprint

578
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,980
cycle is directly a full waterfall cycle

579
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,360
going through you're doing all your

580
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,159
checks and balances producing a product

581
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,140
that goes out

582
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,880
product owners need to have connection

583
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,400
to security requirements they need to

584
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,140
understand it security needs to have a

585
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,000
good tie-in for requirements back to

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,039
your product owners to your agile teams

587
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,720
to your

588
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,360
scrub Masters or anything else let's do

589
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,220
the right channels

590
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,760
is cross-train a lot of growth comes

591
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,159
from teaching others you need to not

592
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,440
just

593
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,780
be in your little

594
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,200
individual Silo and not be a team player

595
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,179
you need to work with your teams answer

596
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,100
questions help people when they're

597
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,320
struggling with their user stories or

598
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,600
other aspects aren't being at the right

599
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
level start educating training them

600
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,340
teaching them better ways to make their

601
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,679
stories better make their the

602
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,659
requirements more

603
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,960
secure through transparency because the

604
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
requirement doesn't have to be a

605
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,260
straight security requirement it can be

606
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,880
a requirement with a security emphasis

607
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,559
embedded within it and that's a better

608
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
way of going through it because that

609
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,480
forces the developers to really think

610
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,059
about what they do your whole process

611
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,039
gets a lot more thought into how you

612
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,559
execute it instead of having it done and

613
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,840
it goes to the next person for review or

614
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,520
the other group then sees it and then

615
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,440
goes we did it wrong you have to go back

616
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,580
and fix it

617
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,600
a lot of costs it goes into fixing

618
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,580
mistakes and we can prevent a lot of

619
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,220
that if we do it properly

620
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,340
the security Silo is very massive at

621
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,179
times

622
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,000
and often in run groups and I've seen

623
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,580
the silos shifted left where they move

624
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,380
from the back to the front and try to

625
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,059
get the requirements in but they never

626
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,820
get it into the right level they never

627
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,760
get the groups actually into it so you

628
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,440
have these awesome requirements that go

629
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,539
in and then it gets through and but

630
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,059
never looked at and it comes back and

631
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,860
they have to repeat the process so you

632
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,440
end up

633
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,779
with security all around in different

634
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,179
silos both at the front and the back and

635
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,580
some in the middle which is really sad

636
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,799
to go through and different groups and

637
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,480
even within security you have different

638
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,159
groups that don't always talk well

639
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
amongst each other

640
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,179
which isn't a whole other aspect

641
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,159
especially if you deal with compliance

642
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,860
and I.T security those groups are

643
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,380
sometimes differential

644
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,440
they should be reorganized more often

645
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,360
than comfortable at times your team

646
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,520
should not be stagnant in order to

647
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,440
cross-train and do stuff well you should

648
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,380
let teams move trying new things help

649
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,580
each other

650
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,799
train each other train different groups

651
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,360
effective team

652
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,000
has good people and has good skill sets

653
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,520
that need to be moved off to others not

654
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,779
all

655
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,659
teams that are highly effective last

656
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,820
long term they're great short term for

657
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,559
projects and when they're broken up

658
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,140
they're those members often can share

659
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,779
good things but they don't always end up

660
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,240
as effective teams but there's a good

661
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,559
chance that most of them will be

662
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,779
effective teams and help build even more

663
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,299
effective teams your agile your

664
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,980
developers will continue to grow and

665
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,140
develop and

666
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,039
immature and in great ways and I've seen

667
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,679
ways where we remove silos and gotten

668
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,960
teams for small projects where we've

669
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,179
gotten the right expertise

670
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,520
both in development of software and

671
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,980
Engineering working together where we

672
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,659
take complex

673
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,520
highly regulated

674
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
projects Within

675
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,980
some of my DOD work that I've done where

676
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,940
it has hard rules and and Safety and

677
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,919
Security and we got the requirements in

678
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,200
early and worked with the dev teams and

679
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,100
got

680
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,799
Cycles back into us for review so we

681
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,120
were able to take programs that normally

682
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,640
take three years or more down to 18

683
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
months

684
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
for end-to-end project including

685
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,279
Hardware to be put into secure

686
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,100
environments it is possible when you get

687
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,840
the right leadership and the right

688
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,679
buy-in from groups you can do pretty

689
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,480
amazing ass

690
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,440
achievements

691
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,779
another one is getting that software

692
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,240
liaison within the Agile development

693
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,260
team

694
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,120
security gets built into the process

695
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,179
removes the silos allows teams to adapt

696
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,799
and grow all big aspects that I really

697
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,480
want to push forward and see is

698
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,240
my term of swallies on getting that

699
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,580
security focused individual and in the

700
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,200
teams working with the scrum Masters

701
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,600
working within the Developers

702
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,840
getting that security Silo fully broken

703
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,159
down removed and embedded into the whole

704
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,240
development life cycle

705
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,520
and we get into

706
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,440
preparing for the future and some of the

707
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,480
aspects is CI CD

708
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,299
shrinking the attack surface

709
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,240
it's rep modeling

710
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,039
kind of deals with model engineering as

711
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,620
well tabletop

712
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,080
for the future DARPA

713
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,080
has a unique program for certification

714
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,820
of software that's fully automated that

715
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,380
they're working on which is pretty

716
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,740
interesting to think about

717
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,880
artificial intelligence

718
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,399
and there's a lot of unknowns

719
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,340
that go into it that we can get into

720
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,700
aspects within the DARPA stuff darpa's

721
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,320
worked a lot with artificial

722
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,720
intelligence if you look back at the

723
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
Cyber Grand Challenge from

724
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,679
I believe 2016.

725
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,200
when they went to Defcon and did their

726
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,860
uh autonomous CTF within their servers

727
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,100
it's a big aspect self-writing code and

728
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,480
other aspects

729
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,419
go into that

730
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,100
so cicd uh those appointment rims often

731
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,980
aren't built well especially from Legacy

732
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,340
groups moving forward

733
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,899
this comic is lots of fun

734
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,240
don't you need a more reliable

735
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,600
deployment system like cicd

736
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,720
it's just a fad our current system works

737
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,100
fine

738
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,080
we have mice running and everything else

739
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,559
why change what's not broken why improve

740
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,840
that's being stagnant there's security

741
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,140
issues that come with it

742
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,640
it's probably lots of vulnerabilities

743
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,740
with the elephant and whatnot what if

744
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,260
something dies or stops working in that

745
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,539
how do you go in and fix it how do you

746
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,460
go through it

747
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,460
you need to think about

748
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,500
continue making things better or

749
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,720
figuring out where processes are lacking

750
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,179
figuring out where

751
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,659
security issues or bottlenecks or silos

752
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,600
are starting to be formed where only one

753
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,940
thing can do the job that's bad you need

754
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,700
to figure out how to make it adaptable

755
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,140
changeable

756
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,260
be able to adjust to the needs

757
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,100
of your business

758
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,279
and sadly a lot of businesses are very

759
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,480
cautionary

760
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,000
within their approach they're very risk

761
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,240
adverse so they don't like change

762
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,159
so we have to present

763
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,740
appropriate arguments to to get them

764
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,559
comfortable with continuing to change

765
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,299
and get out of that philosophy and

766
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,399
actually show that there's risk in

767
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,679
staying behind that's bigger than doing

768
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,080
the change that's often hard to do

769
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,500
it's another great infograph on cicd

770
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,080
of some aspects that you have to think

771
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,899
about if you automate too much and not

772
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:49,440
do the right checks within it then

773
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,960
the attacker can maybe just automate the

774
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,520
attack right into your system without

775
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,440
any effort

776
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,720
into it

777
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,340
you have to work at your tools

778
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,440
evaluate them get into the third party

779
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,779
analysis of any of the tools that you

780
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,220
use

781
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,700
uh and used another infograph

782
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,799
kind of like this on other aspects where

783
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,140
open source software it's great and

784
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,200
everything else but then you lose you

785
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,779
don't add to the open source system

786
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,620
or add to the development Cycles you end

787
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,020
up going back to hosted versions or

788
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,940
walled Gardens where you need support

789
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,640
because you lose the expertise lose

790
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,799
aspects to it you need to understand

791
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,200
what you're getting into understand the

792
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,240
full aspects both in security and

793
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,480
development and other aspects to go with

794
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,659
it

795
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,640
but when we get into artificial

796
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,899
intelligence

797
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:53,159
that's a unique other part when we have

798
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,140
this is the DARPA Grand Challenge from

799
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,000
Defcon

800
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,940
and this was a unique theme with

801
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,919
computers writing their own code writing

802
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,899
their own vulnerabilities writing their

803
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,779
own fixes when that becomes a theme

804
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,880
that's basically your development going

805
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,940
into your operations pipeline

806
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,460
the operation site that whole pipeline

807
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,320
starting to make its own adjustments of

808
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,100
code

809
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,620
how do you deal with that how do you

810
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,960
make sure your developments seem can

811
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,700
adapt to any changes that might happen

812
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,220
automatically in an operation site

813
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,120
that's a big unknown not I'm not sure if

814
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,700
anyone's fully got into a part where

815
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,980
developers produce code but your

816
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,740
operation sign can modify that code for

817
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,260
security or other aspects

818
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,179
and then how do the developers get the

819
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,760
feedback of the changes so they can stay

820
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,880
up and informed to that and move forward

821
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,700
unique aspects to think about within

822
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,399
this a lot can be scary a lot can be

823
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,919
good but we need to be Forward Thinking

824
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,140
when this comes up and gets into it we

825
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,179
need to be educated that's a continuous

826
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:01,919
learning to learning

827
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,960
back in the I.T graveyard I don't want

828
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,279
to learn something new I don't want to

829
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,080
be up to date on the things that's

830
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,320
detrimental to the whole process we need

831
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,580
to

832
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,719
be adaptive and learn to go into it

833
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,179
a lot of the unknowns get into Quantum

834
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,659
Computing alien technology whatever you

835
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,060
can dream of there's a lot out there

836
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,480
that we don't even know what's feasible

837
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,119
some black government program that's

838
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,099
doing something weird or

839
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,260
some unique business somewhere in the

840
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,320
world doing something that's unheard of

841
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,679
unknown totally out of this world and

842
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,440
how do we deal with it we can only

843
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,119
prepare for the unknown if we continue

844
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,219
to carry against the present

845
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,359
in that we have to be up to date and

846
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,699
continually learning and improving our

847
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,739
own processes our own Dev psychops

848
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,380
environments getting learning what's

849
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,480
waste what's bottlenecks continue to

850
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,160
maintain it kind of like the old

851
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,060
factories and that are still around even

852
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,560
in the automobile World they keep

853
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,839
continually make it better it went from

854
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,000
people assembling cards to robots

855
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,440
assembling cars

856
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,440
the same aspect deals with psychops and

857
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,540
our development aspects is that we need

858
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,640
to figure out what's slowing things down

859
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,160
what and how we can improve it what

860
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,339
parts of security are taking too long or

861
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,200
doing the wrong thing how do we Branch

862
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,859
it out when you look at the factory side

863
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,560
it still has the side shoot off for pen

864
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,579
testing or doing s-bombs or looking at

865
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,640
your your third-party code aspects that

866
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,079
take extra Tire

867
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,440
but those are like taking a car part

868
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,940
that's assembled and running through a

869
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,700
test track and doing other aspects what

870
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,619
you learn from that goes in to help

871
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,320
improve your existing pipeline figure

872
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,240
out where your tools are lacking figure

873
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,339
out where your security needs to be

874
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,500
improved upon what can be done in your

875
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,300
factory or what needs to go back to your

876
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,460
development teams and get their user

877
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,619
stories more up to date up to

878
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,380
how your programmers what what skills

879
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,320
are they lacking what new secure coding

880
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,359
standards need to be put in there what

881
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,400
needs to be trained what functions need

882
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,280
to be removed from their tool sets

883
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,099
because they're full of holes lots of

884
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,660
vulnerabilities they shouldn't be

885
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,220
allowed in the first place why did they

886
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
even get in there there's lots of

887
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,839
aspects as we take a lot and a lot of

888
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,400
people are using things that they don't

889
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,380
develop these days and adding it to code

890
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,020
we need to understand the history and

891
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,339
that's kind of the philosophy of the

892
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,380
software building materials that are

893
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,240
coming around is fully getting a history

894
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,099
of what's out there and where it comes

895
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,940
from how to make sure that it's viable

896
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,859
in our Dev psychops in our environments

897
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,599
when we produce software so we're secure

898
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,500
we need to remove security as a giant

899
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,160
waste and Silo roadblock that people

900
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,140
hate because we're just a hindrance on

901
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,720
their things but get into so it's

902
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,000
transparent and into the process into

903
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
how they develop code into how they do

904
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,500
things so they

905
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,339
it makes everything this work and

906
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,099
be happy which is probably still a pipe

907
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,280
dream for many years but it would be

908
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,579
nice to see when we finally start

909
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,099
improving and maturing our our whole

910
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,040
environments where we can see growth and

911
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,400
we stop going in circles and Cycles

912
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,359
just like how agile comic before for the

913
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,500
people every five years hit the

914
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,660
waterfall security a lot of sense we hit

915
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,359
the same issues every few years we that

916
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,579
we thought we got rid of but they come

917
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,320
back in different forms

918
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,060
we should move away from that so it

919
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,420
stops being circles but more of a line

920
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,520
where we're improving and becoming

921
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,700
better

922
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,980
so I have about

923
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,140
14 minutes left so

924
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,480
have a cute any questions

925
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,240
no one has any questions

926
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,098
within there's a cops

927
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,460
this is a whole different Dynamic of how

928
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,800
a lot of companies do things and we need

929
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,440
to really change the way that we we

930
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,960
think and how we produce software yes

931
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,680
changed himself

932
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,380
that's

933
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,480
that's a good point that's a train

934
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,460
budgets to get different members to

935
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,440
different conferences to get them to

936
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,300
bring it back and then teach other

937
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,760
groups as funding won't let the whole

938
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,460
team go to different aspects kind of

939
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,480
dividing conquer

940
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,460
in some aspects can help within that

941
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,400
to go in a lot of organizations do that

942
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,740
in some extent even larger ones where

943
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,359
they don't they can't send to everyone

944
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,000
so they send certain people that have

945
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
more inclination in that so they can

946
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,020
learn the most and bring it back and

947
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,320
help do internal training processes and

948
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,359
if you've even within that you take

949
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,780
people and you can give them subjects to

950
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,380
research on their own to learn

951
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,599
and they'll go out and learn and build

952
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,000
up and become their own expert and then

953
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
they can come back and share that

954
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,720
information within the teams within the

955
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,520
environments give them little side

956
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,280
projects if possible on doing something

957
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,420
different

958
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,579
uh it's kind of like the philosophy of

959
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,460
lighting programs help on open source

960
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,500
projects and use part of their time to

961
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,760
build on that because they can learn

962
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,619
stuff within that project but then they

963
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,540
can translate into their normal workload

964
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,579
and maybe learn something from different

965
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,040
teams that they worked with to build up

966
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,380
that team on new experiences that's kind

967
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,060
of the point of letting your teams

968
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,800
reorganize into different teams

969
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,420
depending if you have more than just one

970
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,760
devsec app steam because every debit

971
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
takes off teams a lot of different

972
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,180
Lessons Learned and different expertise

973
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,579
that they can then teach each other in

974
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,060
different aspects by either through team

975
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,680
reorganizations or other types of

976
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,380
training aspects

977
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,980
that

978
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,119
answer your question

979
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
okay

980
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,060
anyone else

981
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,280
Friday morning everyone's brain it's all

982
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,760
melted

983
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,760
yes

984
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:01,260
the software building materials

985
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,000
to build it

986
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,540
on how you build it so you're asking or

987
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,220
I can't quite fully

988
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,119
okay

989
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,020
so

990
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,560
there are two at least two tools I know

991
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,300
of that will do

992
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,579
some type of software build materials

993
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,339
they're pretty expensive tools they go

994
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,800
through and do full Library analysis of

995
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,900
code to go through

996
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,400
uh

997
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,980
I'm not sure if I should say vendors we

998
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,720
can talk later on that

999
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,220
on here but they go through and we'll

1000
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,900
diverge it and actually figure out where

1001
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,880
different libraries come from which

1002
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,220
countries and aspects

1003
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,480
so you can do it it's a really hard

1004
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,180
process in a lot of things and companies

1005
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,920
are slowing it into it more

1006
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,040
it takes big databases some of the tools

1007
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,140
are like multi-terabytes of information

1008
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,820
that they have to go through to go

1009
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,640
through it so it is kind of a bottleneck

1010
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,640
on that third-party analysis of code to

1011
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,940
go through but it is becoming a bigger

1012
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,460
reality and being pushed a lot more the

1013
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,920
government's really pushing it into

1014
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,300
their software development making

1015
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,760
requirements which will then push a lot

1016
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,560
of companies to get into it

1017
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,720
as it's going to be a hard requirement

1018
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,099
for programs

1019
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,160
and there's a lot of software

1020
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,960
software-centric programs going on and

1021
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,359
being done right now so it is a reality

1022
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,780
it's not an easy reality right now

1023
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,540
but it is something that hopefully

1024
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,579
within the next few years will become

1025
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,220
more feasible to more organizations to

1026
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,300
get into

1027
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,940
but there is some tools out there that

1028
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,980
will do analysis yes

1029
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,520
it's definitely a growth filled and part

1030
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,420
of the continuous Improvement aspect and

1031
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,960
it's nice to see these tools get moving

1032
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,260
and being built it's a good process for

1033
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,800
the software

1034
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,280
anyone else

1035
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,819
yes

1036
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,260
that's a very good question and that's

1037
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,140
so how you need to every organization in

1038
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,359
some regards because of how you you

1039
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,660
build your processes how you how your

1040
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,000
business runs how they've set up that's

1041
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,940
kind of like the original comic of the

1042
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,319
comment of that I know this place said

1043
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,119
silos but I didn't realize how heavily

1044
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,339
protected they are is that you have to

1045
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,380
figure out ways of removing that

1046
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,319
protection that that comfort of that

1047
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,119
Silo that people have this is my job

1048
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,040
security this is my Silo I don't want to

1049
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,619
share my information this is my my check

1050
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,220
box of the process but that's working

1051
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,380
within the other groups if you're this

1052
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,140
Silo try to talk to the silos next year

1053
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,240
to figure out better ways of improving

1054
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,618
your process flow yes

1055
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,040
we want to learn training

1056
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,220
training

1057
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,560
through security people will talk to the

1058
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,140
devs and the devil

1059
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,780
I feel like that way

1060
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,680
we're not maybe having the same

1061
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,119
conversations every

1062
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,119
day

1063
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,859
that is one way is to do lunch and Learn

1064
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,660
Type things where you get that different

1065
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,720
expertise and kind of get through but

1066
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,700
make it more not really optional learn

1067
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,099
to learn but more required little

1068
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,520
meetings uh share of knowledge

1069
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,280
can get them so they understand what you

1070
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,740
do because a lot of reason why silence

1071
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,480
exist is because one group doesn't

1072
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,980
understand what the other group is even

1073
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,140
doing so as you understand what other

1074
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,060
groups then you can optimize your

1075
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,520
process and flow and that helps remove

1076
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
your silos in that oh we didn't realize

1077
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,440
we're duplicating all these efforts or

1078
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,240
doing these things or doing all this

1079
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,859
other stuff because

1080
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,900
they're stuck in their Silo and they

1081
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,400
don't want to share and do things so

1082
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,520
it's really getting the other viewpoints

1083
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,119
bringing other groups into it uh some

1084
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,400
books that can't talk about it

1085
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,859
uh the original book for operations is

1086
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,619
called the goal which is really nice it

1087
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,000
was with

1088
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,400
a factory manager and going through and

1089
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,960
learning how to make things streamlined

1090
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,700
and he has a great thing with Boy Scouts

1091
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,000
and how if you put the past Boy Scouts

1092
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,180
fast hikers early then they separate in

1093
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,220
weird long line and everything's all

1094
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,380
hodgepodge but if you put the slowest

1095
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,700
person in the front

1096
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,160
then he actually moves faster and

1097
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,960
everyone gets there at the same time and

1098
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,599
it's more effective at it it's a really

1099
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,000
unique philosophy and then that's that

1100
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,560
was the emphasis for the books the

1101
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,079
Phoenix project and the Unicorn project

1102
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,599
which are also really great books to

1103
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,700
read but do take them as a grain of salt

1104
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,140
they don't have a lot of security in

1105
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:52,920
them

1106
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,319
but if you can take some of those

1107
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:56,940
terminologies that maybe some of the

1108
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,700
managers have read and add security into

1109
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,700
that terminology it can help

1110
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,500
change their Viewpoint and get them

1111
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,980
thinking better and more effective and

1112
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,440
making things

1113
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,880
for your organization yes

1114
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,440
yeah that's about right

1115
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,579
it's an old book

1116
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,579
any other questions

1117
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,880
yes

1118
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,819
others

1119
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:04,859
trust level but

1120
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,079
as far as like when you stand up

1121
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,680
something that's

1122
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,819
what we are

1123
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,300
I probably wouldn't do AI as a first

1124
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,599
step into a lot of aspects I I get a

1125
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,460
tool that you understand and then

1126
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,500
basically off of that and then build

1127
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,020
upon that to make it better

1128
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,020
kind of the same philosophy of

1129
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,540
if you understand the thing that you're

1130
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,880
working with when the issue pops up you

1131
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,680
can find it quickly well if you're

1132
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,880
dealing with something that you have no

1133
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,740
clue how it runs and an issue pops up

1134
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,720
you won't find it for months or years

1135
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,680
later

1136
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,900
and that's an issue with security if you

1137
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,280
try to use tools that you aren't

1138
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,980
familiar with they can have unforeseen

1139
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,740
consequences within it so

1140
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,380
if you're trying to deal with

1141
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,579
AI I I recommend that you deal with a

1142
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,440
process that you're familiar with to

1143
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,359
base it off of so then you can become

1144
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,119
trusted you can build trust within the

1145
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,819
process and build upon that

1146
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:20,339
which is probably easier said than that

1147
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,819
but

1148
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,079
anything else

1149
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,500
if not thank you

1150
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,629
[Applause]
