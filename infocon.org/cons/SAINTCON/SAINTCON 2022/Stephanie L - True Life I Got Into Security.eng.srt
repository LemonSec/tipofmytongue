1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
welcome to my talk it is called true

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,220
life I got into security I don't know

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,540
how many of you are familiar with the

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,420
true life series from back in the day or

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,740
for some people that's not back in the

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
day but for me it's back in the day on

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,280
MTV where they used to follow people

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,060
around and document their tragedies so

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,800
um I don't consider my career in

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
security a tragedy but I do think that

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
there are lots of things that I think

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,460
people don't know about what it's like

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,039
to work into security especially if you

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,019
went through it the hard way like I did

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,660
and didn't rely on like education in

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,340
order to get yourself ahead if you

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,680
worked your way up I think there are

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,960
some expectations that you might have

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,300
and so today we're going to talk about

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,100
it

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,300
so who am I I am Stephanie

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,980
um on Twitter I am known as Steph and

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,440
Seck I work at Cisco I'm a security

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,140
engineer and I've been in security for

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,399
six years and in tech for nine I am

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,520
neurospicey I do have ADHD so I think a

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,539
lot of us especially in the previous

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,519
talk they talked about how a lot of us

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,979
are neurospicey so just wanted to throw

30
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,740
that in there I do have my bachelor's in

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,080
information technology and I am

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,760
perpetually tired like the rest of us

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,740
and there's some starts on there and the

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,960
ETC means there are some search that I

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,580
have that are not relevant enough to

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,060
talk about

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,659
so as I stated before this talk is just

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,600
to talk about what I'm debunking in

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,040
terms of what is understood in this

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,460
industry as well as what the reality of

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,020
those myths are after five years in this

42
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,840
industry I finally got into security and

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to detail my journey uh

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,060
shortly and after four years as a

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,040
security practitioner there's some stuff

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
that I kind of went

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,540
this is not what I was expecting reality

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,520
is a lot different than what I was

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,439
expecting from my training from talking

50
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,840
to people from mentorship from

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,939
conferences I think I got a different

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,159
vibe for what the security industry was

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,979
going to be and then in practice it is

54
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,739
something different not necessarily bad

55
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,220
just different

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,500
so this is what we're going to go over

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,020
today of course I introduce myself and

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,360
my talk already I'm going to talk about

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,300
my journey a little bit at length

60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,560
um I'm also going to touch on

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,780
expectation versus reality in this

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,340
industry

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,459
um some last remarks and then of course

64
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,920
a spot for questions if there are any

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,800
so what does my timeline look like so

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
the first job I ever had was a chat tech

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,440
for a web hosting company and it was a

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,739
small startup in Houston and it was

69
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,080
pretty much like a frat house but it was

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,700
really fun because there were so many

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,140
brilliant people that worked there and I

72
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,420
think a lot of small startups tend to

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,879
have really brilliant smart people so

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,940
that was my first introduction into the

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,800
Linux world and what that looked like

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,300
and it was super fascinating to just

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,580
like sit at the feet of some Linux and

78
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,379
admins and be like oh my God you can do

79
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,900
so many cool things

80
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,300
and kind of get my first practical

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
introduction into security engineers and

82
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,400
what they may do

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
um for me up until that point I had just

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,280
been in school I was studying for an

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,819
actual security degree before I switched

86
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,379
and my exposure at that time was a

87
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,540
little bit scary

88
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,980
most of the time the professors were

89
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,420
telling us not to do the things that we

90
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
were learning in class otherwise we'd be

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,739
arrested and I don't know about you but

92
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,560
that's not very attractive so I would

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
not practice or Tinker but this job kind

94
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,200
of exposed me to ways to get around that

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,720
ways to practice that will not land you

96
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,220
in jail

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,280
so year two I'm feeling myself a little

98
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,379
bit but I'm going away from part time

99
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,360
and I want to do full time because broke

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,879
and so I was like let me go ahead and do

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,459
help desk and see what all the buzz is

102
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,540
about because everybody talked about

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,819
help desk this help desk that and I

104
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,400
absolutely hated it it was very boring

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
for me I was tired of having to do cable

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,680
management for conference rooms because

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,358
you would do it in the morning and by

108
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,199
the afternoon you had to do it again so

109
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,360
for me I felt like that was not a great

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,780
use of my brain space Also I get bored

111
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,000
super easily so I felt like this was not

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
the job for me but I did it for a year

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,259
because I felt like if you want to say

114
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,880
that you don't like something doing it

115
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,500
for a year was a way for you to never

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
revisit a chapter again because you did

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,160
it for a very long time

118
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,919
at this job I had no exposure to

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
security at all so I kind of just had to

120
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,560
continue to talk to people that I would

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,280
meet people from my former job and try

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,900
to get some experience that way while

123
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,860
studying for security certs around year

124
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,139
three I was becoming a little bit more

125
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,919
anxious to get into security and I felt

126
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,160
like I had wasted my time so I decided

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,900
to go back to the web hosting company

128
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,080
but this time I went with an agenda and

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,240
in this particular company to go from

130
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,479
Support Tech to Junior Linux admin up

131
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
the admin Trail you had to take a

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,340
three-week boot camp and then do a

133
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,080
screen test where they were screened

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,720
into your machine and they gave you a

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
bunch of commands in a broken box and

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,479
you're supposed to do a bunch of stuff

137
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,320
on the on the server it was the one of

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,419
the most scariest tests of my life

139
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,220
because anybody watching me do anything

140
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,860
is guaranteed for me to fail but I

141
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,139
passed test and I became a junior Linux

142
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,880
admin and it was a very exciting time

143
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,220
for me because I was that much closer to

144
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,720
getting into security

145
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,919
so this took about six months and then I

146
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,020
was working as a junior Linux admin for

147
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,419
an additional six months by the time I

148
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,600
got ready to start the trail into the

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,940
security department they decided to

150
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,020
Outsource to India and so I was stuck

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,560
yet again just missing my opportunity

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,360
and I was like well what do I do I've

153
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,100
learned all this Linux stuff and though

154
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,620
it's useful to me today I was not sure

155
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,539
how useful it would be to me in the real

156
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,660
world so then I pivot yet again and I

157
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,880
decided to do product support for a

158
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,860
security company and I was like they

159
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,539
can't they can't escape because security

160
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,100
is what they do so there's no

161
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
Outsourcing what you actually do

162
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,080
and you know we'll come back to that so

163
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,819
I decided to be a product support

164
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,740
specialist I get into the nitty-gritty

165
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,300
of this product and I learn the ins and

166
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,940
outs and then they have a re-org in year

167
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,280
five and I became a network analyst

168
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,039
because the device that they had was sat

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
in line on the network and so you kind

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,780
of got to learn a lot of network stuff I

171
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,080
learned subnetting that was crazy but I

172
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,440
enjoyed it and I really got closer to

173
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,300
shadowing different security and

174
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,880
professionals or Securities analysts in

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,460
the sock and uh just trying my way

176
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,580
trying to get in that way but by this

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,039
point there was one day I came into work

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,819
and they laid off 43 people buying by

179
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,120
noon so at that point I was like man I

180
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,759
can't catch a break and I was wondering

181
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,319
what I was going to do if I was going to

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,599
be able to stick around and get into

183
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,240
security or if I was going to have to

184
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,539
figure out another plan by this point I

185
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,180
got my Security Plus us which is the

186
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,300
very very basic entry level SEC security

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,360
cert but it was a way to prove to me

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
that even though I'm neuro spicy and I

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,039
have ADHD I can take tests and pass them

190
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,020
because that was debatable up until this

191
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,000
point

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,539
so I finally get my first security job

193
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,099
and

194
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,280
wasn't on a team I wish was it with

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
support no I was the only security

196
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,380
presence in the entire company and it

197
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,139
was my first security job and this is us

198
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,680
this is also not uncommon a lot of

199
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,240
people I've talked to over the years

200
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,220
have said that they also had their first

201
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,199
job where they were the only security

202
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,440
presence in the company so lots of

203
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,919
mistakes were made I did choose this

204
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,780
time to start getting on Twitter and

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,699
starting to meet people in the industry

206
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,400
because the people around me were not

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,039
very helpful even though they tried to

208
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,039
be and they were kind of thought one way

209
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,380
because Houston has a very specific type

210
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,740
of culture so at this point I was like

211
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,440
well I don't know this crazy man hired

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
me I don't know why he hired me because

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,279
it's my first job I have a Security Plus

214
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,620
but in no way am I equipped to handle

215
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,779
the security posture of an entire

216
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,899
national retail company but I was

217
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,300
because I feel like everybody was the

218
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,339
only there was only one network guy once

219
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,600
this admin one um uh uh I forget the

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,339
name of it but someone that only manages

221
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,980
like updating but does not assist admin

222
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,180
somehow

223
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,760
um and we were all kind of doing our own

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,620
thing and really ignorantly going

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,600
through our jobs but they still paid us

226
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,540
so that was great in year seven I

227
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,019
finally got a job in a team and I began

228
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,899
to work but I was still I still had a

229
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,640
lot of responsibility I was the only

230
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,459
security presence in the U.S but I had

231
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,240
counterparts in Europe and South Africa

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,180
and Australia and in Canada so there are

233
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,500
people I could at least talk to about

234
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,019
things I had seen on on my end things I

235
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,399
need to help with and assistance with

236
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,160
and in this job there was a CSO there

237
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,279
was a manager so I felt like okay I'm on

238
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,860
an established team so I should be able

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,779
to learn a lot more rather than

240
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,940
constantly putting myself in situations

241
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,800
that were extremely stressful but I

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,420
somehow got out of

243
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,540
so by year eight I was done with that

244
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,000
because it was it was not what I thought

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
and I'll talk about that later in the

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
talk and I decide to join Cisco well I

247
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,300
actually decided to join Duo which is a

248
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,180
multi-factor authentication company and

249
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,760
they Cisco acquired Duo so that is how I

250
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,560
ended up at Cisco

251
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,260
and I was finally on a team of other

252
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,720
security analysts and I had a security

253
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
manager there was a CSO there was a

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,220
hierarchy and I was so geeked I was like

255
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,380
oh my God this is it this is where I can

256
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,959
learn this is where I can you know have

257
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,180
mentors this is where I can kind of grow

258
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,920
in a safer environment and I don't have

259
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,540
to have the weight of the security

260
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,600
posture on only my back but things were

261
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
not as they've seen so I'm still there

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
but now I am under Cisco and no longer

263
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,940
under Duo and I'm a security engineer by

264
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,459
title that means so many different

265
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,440
things to so many people and I was

266
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,300
discussing it with someone earlier that

267
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,899
titles can kind of fluctuate but by this

268
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,720
point I had started to reflect on my

269
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,700
time in the industry and what I thought

270
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,040
so far and I think after getting through

271
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,779
the entry-level States you kind of

272
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,399
decide okay well where do I want to

273
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,279
Pivot to next what's the next step

274
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,579
because my ultimate goal was CSO but

275
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,920
there's a lot that can happen in between

276
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,380
there and I had not planned for that my

277
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,480
whole life had been focused on getting

278
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,540
into security and then staying in it and

279
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,040
now that I felt comfortable I didn't

280
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,720
know what the heck I was going to do

281
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
next so that's why the future has a

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,959
question mark question mark question

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,119
mark because it's still TBD

284
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,200
so

285
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm gonna go through a bunch of

286
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
myths or a bunch of expectations I had

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
based on what I heard from peers from

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,660
professors from other people in the

289
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,980
industry from colleagues anyone you name

290
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,140
it I collected these expectations or

291
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,899
beliefs about what it took to be a

292
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,600
successful security practitioner and I'm

293
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,540
going to bust these myths so the first

294
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,079
one is that you need to code and I put

295
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,899
right here coder bust

296
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,980
so the expectation is that I needed to

297
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,920
know multiple languages fluently not

298
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,019
just enough to script but enough to

299
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,820
really really build something and do

300
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,640
some damage and not having that would

301
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,100
put me super far behind and I wouldn't

302
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,600
really be able to experience any level

303
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,640
of success without it

304
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,060
in reality it really depends on what

305
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,399
your goals are and I have not really

306
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,320
needed it thus far except for automating

307
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,079
and scripting like I mentioned before so

308
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
enough to be dangerous enough to read

309
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,700
but not enough to be able to build

310
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,860
anything on my own without heavily in

311
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,839
heavily referencing Google

312
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,959
so um now I learn on my own strictly

313
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,579
because I want to but not necessarily

314
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,459
because my job requires it so that was

315
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,100
the first thing where I was like

316
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,220
this is not what I thought somebody sold

317
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,560
me a lie

318
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
the second one is education so degrees

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,839
inserts and boot camps oh my I was told

320
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,600
that if I did not have a degree or a

321
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,120
cert or enroll in some boot camp though

322
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,519
the boot camp thing was actually not as

323
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,820
heavily pushed as the other two that I

324
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,060
would be a failure and so I was kind of

325
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,800
wondering because those things cost

326
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,740
money and they take a lot of time and

327
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,740
energy from you and also require a lot

328
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,600
of time and energy and there's nothing

329
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,120
wrong with that portion however if

330
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,260
you're like me and you have my

331
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,260
background time needs to be managed very

332
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,660
efficiently to make sure that I am able

333
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,060
to support myself as life goes on so I

334
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,220
kind of wanted to make sure that the

335
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,459
time I put in was going to come out or

336
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,800
was going to work for me

337
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,220
so like I said the expectation or the

338
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,380
myth here is that you need a degree or

339
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,480
you need certs or that you um or that

340
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,579
you'll need to know everything and never

341
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,380
seem incompetent not even for a second

342
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,880
you're not allowed to say I don't know

343
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,160
and you're not allowed to say I'll check

344
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,200
um that is kind of the vibe I got from a

345
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
lot of security people either I talked

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,459
to or I worked with or I shadowed or

347
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,079
when going to conferences I would hear

348
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,060
people talk about you know that they

349
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,120
just are the know-it-all or the expert

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,579
but the reality is even at Cisco we all

351
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,700
use Google University quite heavily

352
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,200
um I don't know about you but my memory

353
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,740
sucks because like I said neurospicey so

354
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,740
I'm not able to remember every little

355
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,180
thing that I've learned over the course

356
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
of my career after nine years I think a

357
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,320
lot of things start to run together

358
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,360
especially depending on what projects

359
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
you're working on currently so for me

360
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,380
I Google a lot at work and it's actually

361
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,660
encouraged in fact if I go to my manager

362
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,940
and I say oh I don't know X Y and Z

363
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,699
they'll say have you Googled it and I'll

364
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,579
be like you're right no one expects me

365
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,800
to know everything now they expect me to

366
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,839
know how to basically do the basics of

367
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,240
my job of course I mean I did have to go

368
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,560
through tenor reviews for my current

369
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,600
role so it's not to say that you just

370
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,240
come in off the street and you can get a

371
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,300
job or work into insecurity but it is to

372
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,360
say that the level of Education

373
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,980
oftentimes doesn't necessarily reflect

374
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,620
in the role that you're actually doing

375
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,519
so education is also ongoing there is no

376
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,940
end date there is no end period you will

377
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,399
constantly be learning whether that be a

378
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,920
formal program which I have nothing

379
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
against I got my bachelor's so I'm

380
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
nothing against that or that be certs or

381
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,300
a boot camp if you want I would honestly

382
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,220
not recommend that but it is your choice

383
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,420
and it is a free country so you can

384
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,160
always be learning whether it be in

385
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,079
these talks whether it be at a

386
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,940
conference whether it be in someone you

387
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,100
meet who just tells you something so

388
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,079
education doesn't have to be formalized

389
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,420
though it does give you a leg up in

390
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,040
certain organizations

391
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,560
so that was something that was not

392
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,899
explained to me in the context that I

393
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,180
just said

394
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,459
so number three

395
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,760
security moves fast

396
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,399
um this is a big one because we've seen

397
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,440
how quickly a zero day can an

398
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,199
organization we've seen how attacks

399
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,560
ransomware has definitely leveled some

400
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
teams we've seen breaches result in the

401
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,240
entire Security Department being laid

402
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,040
off so you're assuming that when

403
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
something is released security is on it

404
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,620
immediately

405
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,560
unfortunately that is not the case in

406
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
every environment I can't speak to every

407
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
environment but I can say and the ones

408
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,259
that I've been a part of things move a

409
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,459
lot slower than you would expect

410
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,560
it really depends on the environment but

411
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,019
sometimes change management certain

412
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,100
approvals red tape of any kind

413
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,319
can drastically slow down your progress

414
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
when it comes to acting against security

415
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,059
threats so this was a super

416
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,099
disappointing thing for me as someone

417
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,319
who has ADHD and likes things to move

418
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,119
super fast when you're hit with that

419
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,240
brick wall of no or not yet or what

420
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
about this you kind of expect that

421
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,199
people will be like don't you get it

422
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,480
there's something attacking us right now

423
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
we need to act and people are kind of

424
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
like but what about this what about that

425
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,380
so there's a whole bunch of people that

426
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,000
you actually have to talk to before

427
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,520
making any changes especially in an

428
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,320
organization that is a little gun shy

429
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,000
when it comes to

430
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,179
um making changes of any kind when I was

431
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,240
at the law firm that was a huge thing it

432
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,340
took months before certain things could

433
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,559
be implemented because of all the red

434
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,299
tape and just the general fear

435
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,880
surrounding anything security related so

436
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,980
that meant a lot of meetings that makes

437
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,900
a lot of phone calls a lot of bridges

438
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,240
before changes made there was actually

439
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,840
one time I made a change because my

440
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,100
previous experience I was the only

441
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,080
security person so I was used to making

442
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,360
changes and not thinking about it and I

443
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,100
made a change and my boss was like yeah

444
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,600
so we'll put in the change request to

445
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,440
put in that change and I was like oh I

446
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,039
um

447
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,020
I already did it he was like oh when did

448
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,799
you do it three days ago he was like oh

449
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,140
let me check my email nobody said

450
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,660
anything so I'm not saying anything and

451
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,100
I skipped through months and he was like

452
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,840
you don't know how many months we saved

453
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,100
by you just making that he was like

454
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,039
don't do it again but you actually saved

455
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,020
us so much time by just flipping that

456
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,240
switch and not telling anybody and I'm

457
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,059
not recommending anybody do that don't

458
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,280
quote me on that

459
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,780
so it honestly depends on which

460
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,280
environment you're in I feel like if

461
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,380
you're in an environment where they like

462
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,179
to be on the bleeding edge maybe you'll

463
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,799
be able to do things super quickly some

464
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,380
startups also work like that

465
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,419
um but if you're in you know a place

466
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,120
that has a lot more liability

467
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,460
um things are a little tricky when it

468
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,380
comes to implementing certain security

469
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,100
decisions

470
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,100
passion man I know I'm going to rob some

471
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,080
feathers here

472
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,840
um but I was told you had to eat sleep

473
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,940
and drink security if you wanted to be

474
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,059
even remotely successful

475
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,700
um and as someone who had only known of

476
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,559
security from a theoretical standpoint

477
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,620
which was education which is schooling I

478
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,640
don't know that I could have been

479
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,740
passionate about what they said because

480
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,020
what I learned in school and what I do

481
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,360
for work are two completely different

482
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,460
things and so what I was learning in

483
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,320
school with them telling me every five

484
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
seconds that I could go to jail I don't

485
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,620
know that I could have been a passionate

486
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,500
about something that I'm scared about

487
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,919
so I was more so like this industry is

488
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,400
going to satiate my neurospicey brain

489
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,799
and I'm gonna always have something to

490
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,360
learn always going to have something to

491
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,140
do so I felt like it would be more

492
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,200
um more compatible with my personality

493
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,640
and my mental afflictions so so I was

494
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,860
wrong though

495
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,820
I thought that you always had to be

496
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,100
tinkering and I thought if your hobbies

497
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,559
weren't security related that you won't

498
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,900
be successful I also thought without

499
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,720
passion you will fail here's what I'll

500
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,260
say passion makes life easier for you

501
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,360
and those around you because somebody

502
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,400
who's excited to show up and do what

503
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,640
they do is so much easier to work with

504
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,740
and if you're excited about what you do

505
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,440
it's so much easier for you to work

506
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,500
however there are other motivators that

507
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,620
are just as strong as passion for some

508
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,340
people never being broke again is a

509
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,400
motivator for some people for some

510
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
people never being bored again is also a

511
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
more motivator and for some people not

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,940
talking to people all day is a strong

513
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,120
motivator so it doesn't really matter

514
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,980
what your motivation is as long as it's

515
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,539
strong enough for you to show up and do

516
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,820
what you do and in a way that is

517
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,520
painless or virtually painless for those

518
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,100
that work with you also having other

519
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,140
Hobbies kind of helps you to be better

520
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,340
at your job I speak as a hobby

521
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,679
um and it has helped me tremendously you

522
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,240
wouldn't think that but it has helped me

523
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,100
tremendously in my job because whenever

524
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,200
something has to be presented people

525
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,539
think of me even though I don't really

526
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,539
tell them when I speak all the time they

527
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,679
know oh in the fact that she's

528
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,600
comfortable speaking and a lot of people

529
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,179
on the team are not not or if you so

530
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,700
solder she's comfortable with her hands

531
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
or he's comfortable with his hands like

532
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,640
there's a lot of things that can apply

533
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,220
and a lot of people make shifts in their

534
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,640
careers I know lawyers doctors nurses

535
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
that have switched into security and

536
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,840
have used that Knowledge from previous

537
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,820
careers to do better at their job here

538
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,720
so

539
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,580
all right number five

540
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,220
every day is exciting Feel the Rush

541
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,460
daily that is not true unfortunately

542
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,100
some days are actually quite boring

543
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,900
I thought that from the moment you walk

544
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,000
in the doors and your first security job

545
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,559
on the first day of your first security

546
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,080
job that you are going to be doing stuff

547
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,820
at Breakneck speed like I mentioned

548
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,500
constantly and that you're going to be

549
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,760
constantly impressed by what's coming

550
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,980
out but what people don't spend enough

551
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,740
time talking about is that every

552
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,720
exciting investigation

553
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,039
every exciting puzzle every exciting

554
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,320
task that you have there's always

555
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,059
something else that's not as exciting

556
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,980
that needs to be done in conjunction

557
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,179
with that so paperwork reports multiple

558
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,080
meetings documentation for days all this

559
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
stuff has to still be completed and it

560
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,500
can be less fun I'm not saying that

561
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,539
sometimes I write an article that I'm

562
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,159
like I want to kiss myself because this

563
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,600
is amazing

564
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,640
um but sometimes it's a lot just to get

565
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,360
through that sloth of work so sometimes

566
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,039
you have to do things that kind of bore

567
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:11,280
you absolutely to tears if you have a

568
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,799
team like mine currently my boss is like

569
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,360
if it bores you I don't want you to do

570
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,340
too much but I don't have I don't think

571
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,080
I've had many bosses that say that

572
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,280
they're kind of like it's got to get

573
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,960
done I don't care if it bores you or not

574
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,059
so some of us have to do some things

575
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,880
that we're not really a fan of and have

576
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,059
some pretty boring periods of time and

577
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,200
that's just the reality of it

578
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,039
number six everyone's a genius except

579
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,580
for you I really thought that every room

580
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,039
I walked in I was going to be the

581
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,240
dumbest person in the room I'm not even

582
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,500
kidding

583
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,740
um I feel like I talk like a valley girl

584
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,880
I and I feel like sometimes I say things

585
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,000
um that are a little bit uh questionable

586
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,679
and it's just the way that I process you

587
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,659
know there's some smartness in there but

588
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,640
outwardly presenting sometimes it does

589
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
not always come out so I always felt

590
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,299
like I was the dumbest person in the

591
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,620
room

592
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,380
so I felt like everybody was going to be

593
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,020
intimidatingly smart and that they would

594
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,580
speak a language I just would not

595
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,799
understand and that I would constantly

596
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,500
feel stupid or behind

597
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,039
um just based on my even professors in

598
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,100
my programs have kind of given this air

599
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,919
of everybody smarter than you

600
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,140
um and everybody's smart here so keep up

601
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,960
but the reality is you actually will

602
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,940
work with some of the smartest people

603
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,159
you've ever met and you will ever meet

604
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,860
in your entire life in this field and in

605
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,559
this industry you will also work with

606
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,900
some of the most complacent it is just

607
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
the name of the game and I think that's

608
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,600
across the industry it's across the

609
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,860
world

610
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,919
um sometimes that means that people were

611
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,780
well I won't say they were really smart

612
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,940
now they're not I'll say they were

613
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,559
keeping up with things and they were

614
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,059
educating themselves and they were

615
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,679
remaining curious

616
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,440
but they've decided for one reason or

617
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,299
another maybe personal life or maybe

618
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,179
goal shift that they no longer want to

619
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,320
keep up with things and they just want

620
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,600
to do the bare minimum to get by that

621
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,460
exists in every single workspace I've

622
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,020
been in both security and out of

623
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,520
security

624
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,760
um so everyone also still looks up looks

625
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,340
things up even the most the smartest

626
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,200
people I know have looked things up as

627
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,100
well

628
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,799
so it's even if you are one of the

629
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
dumbest people in the room some of the

630
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,760
smartest people I know have said that

631
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,140
they feel like the one of the they're

632
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,400
one of the dumbest people in the room so

633
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,779
I feel like that's mostly in your head

634
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,320
as well

635
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,500
okay so establish teams I don't even

636
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,299
have a sentence for that because just

637
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:48,360
the concept of established teams is a

638
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,860
little bit of a myth

639
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,720
um you think that once you join an

640
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,039
established team there's going to be

641
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,900
everything set up processes are going to

642
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,940
be in place expectations are going to be

643
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,179
in place hierarchy roles the resources

644
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,500
that you need are going to be in place

645
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,419
you think you're joining something that

646
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,700
all you have to do is focus on your role

647
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,940
and that's it however

648
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,000
the reality is sometimes your one org

649
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,919
change away from not being on an

650
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,200
established team or your one leadership

651
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,179
change away from not being on an

652
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,299
established team or sometimes in that

653
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,880
established team you simply grow and you

654
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,039
decide that what you've been doing is no

655
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,960
longer industry standard we're no longer

656
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,880
going to keep up with what's happening

657
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,960
today

658
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,559
so you can constantly be in flux and I

659
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,000
don't think that there's been a single

660
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,340
team even on Cisco I don't think there's

661
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,140
been a single team that I've joined that

662
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,880
has been completely perfect and all I

663
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,279
get to do is my job I think every job

664
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,380
I've had I've had to write policy I've

665
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,659
had to write process even though that is

666
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,679
not my role so I don't know if and I did

667
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,720
say my first role ever was a security

668
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,020
team of one so I don't really know if

669
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,640
there's a such thing as an established

670
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,559
team and I'm I would love for somebody

671
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,779
to point out that they're in one and

672
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,880
have been one for a while

673
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,520
so that is another myth that I found

674
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,419
okay so and this I believe is the final

675
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,100
myth which is security gets easier easy

676
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,899
peasy lemon squeezy

677
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,740
the expectation is once you've learned

678
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,900
all the things security gets easier

679
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,419
you'll one day be free of the Affliction

680
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,120
of imposter syndrome and you will Ascend

681
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,460
to security God status and no longer be

682
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,179
a peasant but the reality is you never

683
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,820
stop growing and learning there's always

684
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,559
going to be something new to do

685
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,299
something new coming out that you need

686
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,460
to expose yourself to and a shift that

687
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,100
happens in the industry for good but you

688
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,279
will have to skill up to understand it

689
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,080
imposter syndrome doesn't really go away

690
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,240
or at least some of the people that I

691
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,039
admire have said that it doesn't go away

692
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,380
there are some people that I'm like oh

693
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,539
my goodness you're everything and

694
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,340
they're like I still get imposter

695
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,559
syndrome before every talk I shake

696
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,039
during every talk I shake or when I'm

697
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,220
committing code I'm nervous or when I'm

698
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,140
creating something new or writing a new

699
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,720
policy I'm nervous it doesn't really go

700
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
away unfortunately and I've I've decided

701
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,620
that I'm just going to embrace that I'll

702
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,020
always feel like a noob at some point

703
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
um however the things that you have

704
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,500
learned do become second nature do

705
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,179
become muscle memory so I don't want to

706
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,799
like sell a dream that you'll just

707
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,539
always be suffering

708
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,240
um but I think in general you will just

709
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
have to get comfortable with constantly

710
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,279
being a newbie at something and I think

711
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,320
uh you have to remind yourself of that

712
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,020
because on my third and fourth year I

713
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,700
really felt like which is ridiculous

714
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
because I know some people that have

715
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,500
been in the industry for like 20 years

716
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,120
and still learning but I thought third

717
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,679
and fourth year all this will be cake

718
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,200
and then I joined Duo and I was like it

719
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,760
took me it normally takes me three

720
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,159
months to learn a role it took me six

721
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,020
months before I felt like I kind of get

722
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,980
it so I had a Big Slice of Humble Pie

723
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
and I think if I constantly remind

724
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,820
myself that I'm going to be a newbie and

725
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,039
it's okay then I wouldn't have to worry

726
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,919
about being hard on myself for not

727
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,520
knowing

728
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,480
so

729
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,520
this quote right here

730
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,480
is a beautiful quote from someone famous

731
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,399
and it is quite profound it says this is

732
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,620
a quote words full of wisdom that

733
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,600
someone important said and can make

734
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,840
others get inspired it is a fake quote

735
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,200
but this is how some people sound that

736
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,480
you will work with sometimes people have

737
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
things to say but they're not always

738
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,399
saying something worth listening to that

739
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,899
is something I feel like plagues our

740
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,899
industry worldwide I feel like there's

741
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,840
so many words that are dispute in

742
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,399
meetings because people want to present

743
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,640
something of value but don't always know

744
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,820
that sometimes silence is valuable and

745
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,919
sometimes you can wait until you have

746
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,720
something that is different than what's

747
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,940
being presented to set so that was a

748
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,159
little jokey joke there but also a

749
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,140
little shade

750
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,080
and then the last thing that I will say

751
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
gatekeeping

752
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,779
um there's a lot of barriers of entry in

753
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,100
this industry a lot of things that

754
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
people tell you you have to be doing or

755
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,059
you have to be thinking or you have to

756
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,220
be practicing if you're not literally

757
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,440
digesting security every day you're a

758
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,320
failure or if you are not doing X Y and

759
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,820
Z there are some interviews that I've

760
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,720
done both in the past and presently that

761
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,659
um drill me like crazy during the

762
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,820
interview process and ask me so many

763
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,740
things but then when you actually get

764
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,020
the job you're doing like a quarter of

765
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,240
those things or or if that sometimes

766
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,039
you're not even really even doing what

767
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,820
they drilled you on so my talk to y'all

768
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,080
which I'm not saying y'all are gay

769
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,159
Keepers but you can spread the wealth I

770
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,500
think that we should continuously be

771
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,899
challenging gatekeeping and I think that

772
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,299
we should be more invested in only

773
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,860
interviewing for those things that we're

774
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,840
actually going to be hiring for letting

775
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,659
people in that can do the job and stop

776
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,399
feeling ourselves and feeling like well

777
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,840
I'm going to make this interview hella

778
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,279
complicated even though I know that

779
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,020
they're going to shuffle papers for the

780
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,580
first 10 months of their time here

781
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,840
because we are going through

782
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,600
organizational changes

783
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,039
um that is something that happens a lot

784
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,360
something that I feel like a lot of

785
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,799
people complain to me about when they've

786
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,179
started their first security role

787
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,580
because I know it takes so much effort

788
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,940
and energy and time and money to get

789
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,779
into this industry and

790
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,460
then you get in and you're kind of like

791
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,380
I'm not doing any of the exciting things

792
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,000
that people kind of led me to believe

793
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,799
that I'd be doing with all the things

794
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,299
that they said I had to do and all the

795
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,399
mountains I had to climb to get here and

796
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,740
I don't think that that is fair or makes

797
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,779
sense because a lot of us are under

798
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,080
resourced and we need help anyway so I

799
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,940
feel like there's no sense in uh in

800
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,799
stopping people from joining if they're

801
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,899
if they're motivated and if they're

802
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,219
going to make our lives easier

803
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,320
so I put the very stereotypical picture

804
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,500
here and I want to say does anybody have

805
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,220
any questions

806
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,678
oh a couple oh okay cool

807
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,919
oh

808
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,320
yeah so actually I'm off the heels of

809
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,240
burnout currently

810
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,820
um I would say uh in the past I had very

811
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,020
different advice because this is my

812
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,039
second round of burnout I'm a vet

813
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,600
and the first time I went on medical

814
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,059
leave so that was great but also I cried

815
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,880
the entire time so I'll say I didn't

816
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,820
want to get that bad again

817
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,220
um this time I just kind of brought it

818
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,299
out now

819
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,799
I have a woo-woo kind of new age team so

820
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,179
they actually want to know that you're

821
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,100
burnt out and they have actual questions

822
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,919
about what can we do is it your job that

823
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,659
kind of thing if you're not in that

824
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,760
environment and your environment is more

825
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,159
traditional and a little less forgiving

826
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,519
or graceful or Grace giving I would say

827
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,880
you would need to balance what you have

828
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,220
but you need to take time off so if

829
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,260
you're the kind of Tinker after work or

830
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,019
you're the kind to do other exercises

831
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:26,399
you might be overloading yourself and

832
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,679
all you can handle is your job I used to

833
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,000
say quit but not everybody can do that

834
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,279
so the first advice would be quit but if

835
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,279
you can't quit I would say you need to

836
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,320
stop juggling as many balls and you

837
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,019
really need to focus on Survival at that

838
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,899
point and if possible talk to your boss

839
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,700
about it or at least your peers anyone

840
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,620
you trust in the organization so that

841
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,000
you have someone that can kind of help

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
with that but it plagues us all so if

843
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,740
you're dealing with it you're smiling so

844
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,840
I don't think you're dealing with it but

845
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
if you're smiling past the pain I feel

846
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,039
for you

847
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,440
any other questions I hope I answered it

848
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,960
did I answer that question good okay yes

849
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,940
you are singing my song because I'm

850
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,500
still to this day trying to figure out

851
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,599
how to specialize where to go so many

852
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,520
things are exciting

853
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,199
um honestly you're doing part of it

854
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,000
which is coming to conferences and

855
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,099
exposing yourself

856
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,719
um because I think that that's one thing

857
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,540
to do but I also I was going to say I

858
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,699
stalk people on LinkedIn but I do it in

859
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,679
a legal way I just try to find someone

860
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,719
who's doing something that I think is

861
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,520
exciting and I get over my social

862
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,619
anxiety and I say like hey do you mind

863
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,560
if I pick your brain for like 30 minutes

864
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,780
or even just asynchronously through text

865
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,119
sometimes when you get a real and I I

866
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,680
feel like you should pick a jaded person

867
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,599
someone who's been in the industry for a

868
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,099
while because they're going to give you

869
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,180
huh you said what

870
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,880
right I'm the queen jaded over here but

871
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,380
yeah I think you should find someone

872
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,240
who's like really been in the industry

873
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,400
and is going to be transparent

874
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,220
um and is not eagerly tied to what they

875
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,240
do

876
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,220
um because they're gonna tell you the

877
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,440
real of it and I feel like knowing the

878
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,040
downsides I think will help you uh make

879
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,540
a decision on if it's for you or not

880
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,460
because everything sounds amazing and

881
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,540
fun

882
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,800
um I don't think there's a single thing

883
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,599
except for and I'm sorry if there are

884
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,579
any GRC people don't hit me

885
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,280
but GRC is not my thing

886
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,720
um but everything else sounds super

887
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,780
exciting and it's hard to narrow or find

888
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,940
what you want without sinking a bunch of

889
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,640
time into training so talking to people

890
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,460
going to conferences reading books

891
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,320
um there's lots of like classes online

892
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,720
too or LinkedIn learning which is a

893
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,859
Shameless plug because I have a course

894
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,500
on LinkedIn learning

895
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,780
um but I think checking those out and

896
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,460
just exposing yourself is the best way

897
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,060
to find it if that doesn't work I'm so

898
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,180
sorry I do not know anything else but

899
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,220
maybe in a few a few months when I've

900
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,820
decided then I have more tips for you

901
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,680
anyone else

902
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,220
yeah

903
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,040
you know nobody has ever talked about it

904
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,960
I used to think that too and my first

905
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,359
Mentor actually told me you need to work

906
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,980
somewhere for two years at least and if

907
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,359
you don't work for some if you don't

908
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,980
work there for two years it's gonna look

909
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,220
bad but I have a bunch of just year jobs

910
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,540
that first one that I was a security

911
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,140
team of one I lasted six months and so I

912
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,520
have some you know questionable

913
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,339
timelines on my resume and it has never

914
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,320
come up I think if you're talking the

915
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,960
talk They Don't Really Care yeah I think

916
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,260
it's when you start to sound that people

917
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,839
will start saying so how why are you

918
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,520
jumping around a lot but don't quote me

919
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,380
I don't know that's just my experience I

920
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,760
nobody's really asked about it

921
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,079
anyone else

922
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,560
yeah

923
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,400
oh you want me to go there

924
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,640
no no no I mean I I'm obviously telling

925
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,760
my business so I will go ahead I think

926
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,460
for me I've experienced more sexism than

927
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,020
racism

928
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,240
um but it's kind of hard to tell the

929
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
racism because it's not as overt

930
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,200
um

931
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
I can't speak to Cisco because I'm under

932
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,320
NDA but I'll speak to other experiences

933
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,440
um I would say that

934
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,720
sexism kind of came up early on when I

935
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,880
was trying to get in any time I would

936
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,339
try to like do a thing of shadowing and

937
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,440
and some some of the Linux admins would

938
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,180
give me broken boxes and say find the

939
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,700
problem like so I was doing all of that

940
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
stuff so showing like I'm really

941
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,240
interested in this stuff I'm taking time

942
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,740
out of my day to do it and to learn

943
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,960
stuff and ask questions and to try

944
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
harder

945
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,579
um and some people just kind of don't

946
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,920
care about you showing those things and

947
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,839
they have an idea in their mind of

948
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,359
what's possible also when I worked with

949
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,359
customers which I zero out of 10 don't

950
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,820
recommend but sorry when I worked with

951
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,260
customers it's a lot worse because I

952
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,359
would have to literally tell like my

953
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,700
male colleagues and co-workers hey say

954
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,040
this exact thing on the phone please

955
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,599
because this customer is saying they

956
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,940
want it escalated and they would say the

957
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,460
exact same thing verbatim literally

958
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,260
listening to me as they're talking and

959
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,180
the person be like see that's why I was

960
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,440
tired of that girl I don't know what she

961
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,060
was doing and would say thank you so

962
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,820
much you fixed my issue so it happened a

963
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,220
lot more when I was in support I would

964
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,560
say in security I don't have as many of

965
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,780
those issues not to say they don't exist

966
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,540
but just not in my resume or in my

967
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,599
experience so that's as much as I

968
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,040
experienced with sexism

969
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,119
it's very possible it's very possible

970
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,220
there's a there's a woman that I

971
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,339
resented at my first ever Defcon because

972
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:27,540
she was like I've never experienced any

973
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,619
of the things that y'all are talking

974
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,400
about and I was like lucky

975
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,780
but I did

976
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,820
um and I I think for her though she kind

977
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,500
of started pretty high started

978
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,960
engineering and went up so for her she

979
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,940
she was like yeah I mean I have so many

980
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,440
friends that are male and I've never had

981
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,720
an issue I've never been excluded from

982
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,200
opportunities so I would say so based on

983
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,359
my experience but I have no statistical

984
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,420
information to corroborate that so
