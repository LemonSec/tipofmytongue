1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
hey hey everyone this is the badge talk

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,640
I hope that's why you're here

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,220
um and this is going to be fairly

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,900
informal because I didn't have time to

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,660
prepare slides and all that fun stuff so

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,719
I hope you all have lots of questions

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,539
um who here's actually played the badge

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,400
game

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,900
it's wheat

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,180
have fun

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,460
no okay that's fair that's fair

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,300
um so yeah to go along with the the

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,920
theme of the conference this year right

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,860
we did a clue game

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,399
um

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
for those that have played did anyone

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
actually finish their game

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
yeah one person a couple people okay

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,579
sweet

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,100
so for those of you still playing we

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
changed the timeouts today to five

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,030
minutes so it should go a lot quicker

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,440
[Applause]

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,239
um yeah sorry if that caused heartache

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
for people we're trying to you know

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,860
strike a balance between making the game

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
fun and also making it last more than an

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,680
hour

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,320
so

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,580
yeah feel free to let me know later if

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,680
we got that wrong or if we should do it

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,900
differently in the future

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,020
um so did anyone figure out

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
like are you all playing the same game

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,220
are you playing together

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,100
no different games everyone has a

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,000
different game

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,500
it's completely randomized

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,080
so yeah this changed many times

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,280
throughout our design process

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,540
initially everyone was playing the same

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,439
game

43
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,720
and that is why we had things like the

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
light sensor to turn off your LEDs when

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,259
the cover was closed so that people

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,479
couldn't Snoop on what you had gotten

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,700
checked off that type of thing

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,860
and that light sensor ended up being a

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,659
pain for some people especially in dimly

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,159
lit rooms

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,920
I apologize for that

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,820
um

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,500
so yeah lots of fun things and design

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,780
changes throughout

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,780
um

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,720
um

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,640
for

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
so for those of you who haven't played

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,720
this is what the the game kiosks look

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,860
like

61
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,319
just a slot for your badge stick it in

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,480
hit suggest or accuse

63
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,520
and it'll start checking things off on

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,940
your badge

65
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,280
for those who are unaware of how these

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,140
types of games work

67
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,300
just want to throw this out there

68
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,239
attacking the game infrastructure is out

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:36,800
of scope

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,099
[Music]

71
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,440
amazing these are not for taking apart

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,220
and messing with

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,700
and who's played with many badges and

74
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,480
getting those on there yes so

75
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,220
someone came to me this morning and had

76
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,680
three sets of mini badge Wings attached

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,180
to their badge the most I've seen so far

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,379
has anyone

79
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,420
done more than that

80
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,440
you got three nice

81
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,930
it broke what's four I'm not surprised

82
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,620
[Laughter]

83
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,379
so yeah going with the thinner pcbs this

84
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,459
year

85
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,260
um that's one of the the trade-offs

86
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,560
right it weighs less and feels more like

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,019
you know a notebook right but yeah a

88
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,360
little flimsier

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,739
um show of hands who thinks we should

90
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,500
stay with the thinner stuff and

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,400
yeah

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,780
Everyone likes to thunder stuff who

93
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,760
likes the thicker badges

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,400
a little bit more okay

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,379
well I guess we'll take that into

96
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,540
consideration next year and see

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,620
how we go about that

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
um

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,799
for

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,480
I guess we should talk about

101
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,120
the hardware all right

102
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,879
um so it's using an RP 2040 it's

103
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,120
Raspberry Pi Pico chip

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,840
um

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,260
it's not the best for this type of

106
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,900
deal one of the big issues with it is

107
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,060
power consumption it's not great at

108
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
doing low power stuff like at all

109
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,040
it's fast but it takes a lot of juice

110
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,680
the problem is it's about the only chip

111
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
you can get in quantity right now

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
reliably

113
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,139
so we actually ordered these chips in

114
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,040
January

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,560
when they became available and I said

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,959
Detroit we need to order these right now

117
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,060
so these have been sitting on a shelf

118
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,460
since January until we built all the

119
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,500
badges

120
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,740
um and one of the weird limitations is

121
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,600
it looks like there's a lot of pins on

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,580
that chip there's really not

123
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,020
we've got 30 iOS to do everything with

124
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,758
it's it's not enough

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,639
um so the LEDs there's 52 of them times

126
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,120
three because they're RGB so 156 LEDs to

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
drive with 30 pins and we still have

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,259
lots of other stuff to do

129
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,600
so they are Charlie plexed

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,340
those of you don't know it's a really

131
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,759
crazy way to connect LEDs to a small

132
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,280
number of pins but it means that the

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,380
LEDs aren't all on at the same time in

134
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,840
fact only one is on at any one time

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,540
so we are scanning through all 156 LEDs

136
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,940
thousands of times a second turning them

137
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,040
on and off to make it look like it's a

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,300
static display

139
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,880
so if you turn on your badge and you

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
shake it in front of you you will see

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,539
that it's pulsing

142
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,639
so that's why the LEDs are not very

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,479
bright

144
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,280
is that they're barely on

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,320
um

146
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,539
what else

147
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,139
did anyone plug in USB to their computer

148
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,520
a couple people did you get anything

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,840
useful

150
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,520
no

151
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,640
nice that's good

152
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,030
[Laughter]

153
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,620
[Applause]

154
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,139
so by the kiosks uh use the USB port for

155
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,479
communication with the badge and so the

156
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,520
badge doesn't respond unless it gets a

157
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
special string from the kiosk and then

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
it'll start responding

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,580
however that's not the only way to get

160
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,960
information out of it

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,539
if you start changing your suggestion on

162
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,639
your badge it'll start spitting things

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,180
over cereal did anyone try that

164
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,120
no you should

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm we obfuscated the stuff a little bit

166
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,139
but not too crazy

167
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,419
so I know a couple people have figured

168
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,699
out how what the the packets are that we

169
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,020
sent back and forth

170
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,300
and that's one of the

171
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,060
valid ways of messing with your badge

172
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,940
you can make it display other things

173
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,340
other than what you've gotten checked

174
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,139
off granted the next time you plug it

175
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,180
into the kiosk it'll get reset

176
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,440
but

177
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,199
lots of fun things you can unlock the

178
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,660
special end mode without actually

179
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,340
unlocking it the right way

180
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,780
lots of fun stuff to play with

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,600
when you finish the game there's some

182
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,400
special LED modes that you can unlock

183
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,240
all right who's got some questions

184
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,919
because I'm drawing a blank here

185
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,280
um it won't do a whole lot afterwards

186
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,340
because I mean it's just a bunch of LEDs

187
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,520
like there's not a screen or much to do

188
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,099
anything with so yeah it doesn't do a

189
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,120
whole lot

190
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
um

191
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,440
I doubt we'll release the server-side

192
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,319
code it's just

193
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,319
yeah it's just a server running some a

194
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
database and we

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
send stuff back and forth it's nothing

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,940
nothing fancy

197
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,340
um so

198
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,020
I don't know what the default baud rate

199
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,000
is but the nice thing about usb over

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
serial is it really doesn't matter

201
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,740
because the

202
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,139
yeah it'll just translate it basically

203
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,240
it'll be

204
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,580
um I don't even know

205
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,080
let's

206
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,639
let's pull up the code actually why not

207
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,819
right

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,400
I want to say it's like you know 115 200

209
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,039
is the default

210
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,520
thing

211
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,338
I don't know if it even says

212
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,399
yeah it's just the standard

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,659
USB uart it's just part of the base code

214
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,000
um but yeah pretty much just connecting

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
to it will

216
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
get you a channel I think it's 115 200.

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,819
I could check right

218
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,320
uh yeah looks like 115 200 is the

219
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,620
default

220
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,459
instead of the usual

221
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,760
um

222
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
so it is deliberate in that

223
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,580
I didn't write the kiosk code

224
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,420
and so interfacing with that was given

225
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,440
to me

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
and so

227
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,040
somebody else did that and that's the

228
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
way it sends it so that it works

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,000
that's about it for that

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,399
speaking of which uh my friend redacted

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,740
is the one who did all the kiosk code

232
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,560
and the back end database code and it's

233
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,940
freaking awesome

234
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,279
so kudos to him for doing that and

235
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,360
helping it's been great

236
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,800
any questions yeah

237
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,519
okay so yeah I mean the goal of the

238
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,200
badge is just something for you to

239
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,720
interact with and have fun that's the

240
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,700
basic goal something

241
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,140
to play with and hack on and just see

242
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,980
what you can do with it

243
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,540
that depends starting with the game or

244
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,220
with the badge itself or with other

245
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,380
parts I mean

246
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,820
yeah

247
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
Okay so

248
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,579
starting with the the game right

249
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,140
um if you

250
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,000
turn on your badge right you have a

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,760
couple blue lights one's blinking that's

252
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,740
the one that you are selecting up and

253
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,260
down buttons to select which

254
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,240
person or uh attack you are selecting

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
okay so go through if you hit the select

256
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,079
button you move over to the other column

257
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
and you can select the other side

258
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,060
once you've got one selected you can go

259
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,680
stick your badge in one of the kiosks

260
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,860
and hit the suggest button and it will

261
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,680
make a suggestion like in clue right

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,440
and then the kiosk will respond as if

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
it's a player saying here's a card

264
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,100
essentially to disprove your suggestion

265
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,500
and then it'll mark it off on in green

266
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,720
on your badge

267
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
and you keep doing that until you figure

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
out which three things right which

269
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,620
person used what attack and what

270
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,860
location

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,320
does that answer your question

272
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,640
yeah green means let's spin

273
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,140
checked off

274
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,899
yeah yeah essentially yeah you check

275
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,959
that off on your on your clue card yeah

276
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,180
so if you guessed right

277
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,560
there are some caveats to this so if you

278
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,000
guessed right the kiosk will tell you

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,459
that it can't disprove your suggestion

280
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,260
now

281
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,540
in trying to come up with a way to make

282
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
this work was 1500 people right not

283
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,380
everyone can play the same game because

284
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,839
there's only 50 some options right and

285
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
1500 people you could very easily and

286
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,480
quickly figure out the common ones

287
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,100
so

288
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,680
you're essentially playing a two-player

289
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,899
Clue game which doesn't always work all

290
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,660
that great if you've ever tried that

291
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,220
because the other person's just got

292
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,220
everything that you don't have right so

293
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,240
one of the differences is the kiosks

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
can only show you a card for their

295
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,760
location not any of the other locations

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,800
so

297
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,500
if a kiosk says it can't disprove your

298
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,139
suggestion all that means is you've very

299
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,940
likely got the other two things right

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,680
but the location could be wrong

301
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,019
so still some some things to

302
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,800
check there

303
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,439
so

304
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
um so

305
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
it's a very diff it's a very difficult

306
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,160
thing to be able to make that available

307
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,000
outside of the conference just because

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,680
there's infrastructure involved there's

309
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,500
servers that we've got to keep running

310
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,240
and at that point we'd essentially have

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,440
to

312
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,720
open up

313
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,959
some sort of way to get your USB serial

314
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,339
to

315
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,940
talk to a web server without anything in

316
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,160
between or we have to rewrite the kiosk

317
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,319
code and that's not a fun thing to do

318
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,639
so the chances of it being available

319
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,220
after is pretty slim

320
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,279
um but again this is supposed to just be

321
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,620
something fun to do right it's not

322
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,459
I guess it's not really designed for

323
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,800
that I know that sucks especially for

324
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,839
volunteers and whatnot I mean heck I

325
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,459
haven't even soldered on my mini badge

326
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,899
wings I haven't

327
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,459
done any of that because yeah I don't

328
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,260
have time either

329
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,040
um

330
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,380
and

331
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,019
that's something we need to think about

332
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,180
more in the future

333
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,800
um

334
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,019
time being what it was this year wasn't

335
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,540
going to happen for those who don't know

336
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,240
I also did Defcon this year so we had

337
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,399
like zero time to do this one

338
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,600
so it's been a struggle but

339
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,180
yeah having something to do with the

340
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,120
badge after is something that is brought

341
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,880
up during the design process but doesn't

342
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,800
always happen just for logistical and

343
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
time reasons

344
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
so yeah

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,220
um I will tell you this for next year we

346
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,779
already have plans for what we're doing

347
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,959
and I'm not doing Defcon again so we

348
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,540
will have time and

349
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,060
next year's is planned to be something

350
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,619
that you can use after the conference

351
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,959
I know that doesn't help this year but

352
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,040
it'll be better in the future

353
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,079
uh so there are 50

354
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,260
items right things on your badge lots

355
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,800
more combinations

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,040
yeah uh-huh

357
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:18,959
okay

358
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,079
um

359
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,639
um

360
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,220
so let's see

361
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,100
we did

362
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,920
the voltage regulator surprisingly

363
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,959
enough those are getting hard to come by

364
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,480
it's weird like that's a very simple

365
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,560
part but yeah they go out of stock a lot

366
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,899
and the problem with those is pin outs

367
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,399
are not standardized

368
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,399
which is always fun so yeah we did have

369
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,399
to change that and we actually ran into

370
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,220
a problem with the big 10 by 10 boards

371
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,640
for the mini badges so

372
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,760
the the voltage regulator that's on here

373
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,380
for those who don't know I'm talking

374
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,059
about

375
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,799
this

376
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,480
this part here

377
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,579
it um

378
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,359
the one we used here was

379
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,760
they had about 2 000 available

380
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,799
so we used all those

381
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
and then

382
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,860
we didn't have enough for the 10 by 10

383
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,419
boards and so we ended up having to

384
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,380
order those from some random reseller

385
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,000
and they showed up in strips of 50

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,740
instead of a reel

387
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,299
and so

388
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,520
that was a big problem because normally

389
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,780
you've run them through a pick and place

390
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,580
machine and it won't deal with little

391
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,340
strips of 50

392
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,679
and a tape so

393
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,140
that was a challenge not with the badge

394
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,600
itself but with other things we did this

395
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,860
year

396
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,820
um

397
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
we did have to the USB connectors were

398
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,380
again something that were in high demand

399
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,059
I guess or they didn't make enough this

400
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,000
year and we had to Source them from

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,220
three different places to get enough of

402
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,059
them

403
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,120
just crazy

404
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,980
um

405
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,600
I think the rest of it we were able to

406
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,860
get fairly easily

407
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,460
yeah nothing else too crazy this year

408
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,179
yeah

409
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,980
we outsourced it for the main badge the

410
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,260
10 by 10 boards I used my small pick and

411
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,700
place for

412
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,340
but yeah doing these would have taken

413
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,059
months

414
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,000
um overall

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,460
overall cost I think we're at about 25

416
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,039
dollars

417
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
assembly is like 850. it's a good chunk

418
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,919
of money it just it costs money it's

419
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
crazy

420
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,080
that's the pie Pico chip yeah and those

421
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,700
are a dollar

422
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,919
yeah which is pretty good especially

423
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,320
nowadays for microcontrollers

424
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,700
yeah

425
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,059
yeah

426
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,559
in recent years

427
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,320
um some of them do

428
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,379
um

429
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,640
trying to remember I mean last year's

430
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,100
badge the lock thing it had some games

431
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,679
that you could play afterwards

432
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,660
um the interactive part it was hard if

433
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,480
you didn't have other people with them

434
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,660
um the Enigma badge had a game and it

435
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,340
still functioned as an Enigma machine

436
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,440
afterwards

437
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,039
um

438
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,400
as this year's Defcon batch was a little

439
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,559
piano synthesizer you could play and

440
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,299
that still works after

441
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,200
um

442
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,679
and yeah I guess it varies this year's

443
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,020
syncom badge is a little more simplistic

444
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,020
than they've been in the past

445
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,840
so yeah it varies and you know we got to

446
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
try to go along with the theme and

447
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
sometimes that just lends itself better

448
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,280
to something simpler

449
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,900
so

450
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,720
yeah so you obviously have a unique

451
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
insight into the chip industry it's

452
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,500
getting better

453
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,740
news

454
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,200
um I don't see any new competitors

455
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,059
happening so

456
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,280
chip Fabs cost billions of dollars and

457
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,419
they take years to spin up so most of

458
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,000
the companies are unwilling to invest

459
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,220
that knowing that in a few years they're

460
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,660
going to have tons of extra capacity

461
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,100
that they don't need

462
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,559
so it's one of those we're just going to

463
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,480
have to suffer through it until things

464
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,740
catch back up hopefully

465
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,980
interacting person to person is

466
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,200
extremely difficult to do

467
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,539
the hardest part about it is the

468
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,020
physical interface

469
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,000
connectors are really easy to break

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,440
and

471
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,600
coming up with something that two people

472
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,159
can plug their badges together and not

473
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,860
break them is difficult

474
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,640
and connectors are also really expensive

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,860
like surprisingly so

476
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,020
and it doesn't seem like much but when

477
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,280
you're looking at 50 cents to a dollar

478
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,679
per connector starts to add up real

479
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,240
quick

480
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,380
um

481
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,620
and you also get into the programming

482
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,260
side of that and how do you do that

483
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,299
there are race conditions between badges

484
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,220
right because one's not in charge of the

485
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,320
other one they're all the same and so

486
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,179
yeah there are a lot of unique

487
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,620
challenges trying to get them to talk

488
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,140
person to person rather than to some

489
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,860
infrastructure

490
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,760
yeah

491
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,460
so I imagine the design process and the

492
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,559
idea process starts way before you sit

493
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,059
down on a product like tricad or

494
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,178
something

495
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,700
come up with the idea of what we're

496
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,900
going to do a batch like

497
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,000
that is an excellent question so

498
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,840
trying to think of the actual process

499
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,780
because that was many months ago

500
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,840
um

501
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,140
I mean for the most part A lot of times

502
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,720
the beginning is just me

503
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,740
um

504
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,419
and so

505
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,340
like this year I did all the hardware

506
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,740
and programming and whatnot and I had

507
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,200
redacted to do the the back end game

508
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,460
part of it

509
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,299
so

510
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
I don't know I mean once we came up with

511
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,140
the the clue theme for the conference

512
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,900
this was just kind of the natural

513
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,820
progression right have a clue

514
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,000
uh you know like the paper check off

515
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,799
things and

516
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,480
just kind of grew from there

517
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,640
um

518
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
mostly self-taught

519
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,720
so

520
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,980
um

521
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,280
his my father was an electrician so I

522
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,480
became interested in electronics very

523
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,260
young

524
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,900
and when I went to college I started

525
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
making circuit boards and at that time I

526
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,679
was etching them myself and doing that

527
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,299
and then I ended up changing college

528
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,460
degrees and I went into electrical

529
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,260
engineering

530
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,159
um

531
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,440
and

532
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,080
yeah it's badge life is a very different

533
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,700
type of

534
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,960
electrical engineering there's

535
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,700
there's the right way to do things and

536
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,280
then there's the badge way to do things

537
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,780
um

538
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,360
so there's a very unique differences

539
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
right most circuit boards go in an

540
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,740
enclosure people aren't touching them

541
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,780
and

542
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,059
touching Electronics is usually bad

543
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,580
static electricity is a thing especially

544
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,740
in a dry climate like here

545
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,740
but you also have the the flip side of

546
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,940
it a

547
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,980
protecting against static discharge is

548
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,919
expensive extra parts Extra Protection

549
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,080
and badges need to be cheap because

550
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,059
they're pretty much disposable and

551
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,740
they're one-time use for a few days and

552
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,960
then no one ever touches them again

553
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,840
so we have to trade off between some are

554
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,880
going to die and we don't want to spend

555
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,720
the money on all of them lasting years

556
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,080
so it's a very weird thing to try to

557
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,820
make that balance out

558
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,740
cultural significance

559
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,380
of badge life oh gosh

560
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,940
I don't know if I'm qualified to answer

561
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,299
that

562
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't know it's this weird thing that

563
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,059
has grown and grown and tons of people

564
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,200
love it and tons of people hate it and

565
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,880
granted because you know it could be

566
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,380
considered a waste of money a waste of

567
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,539
resources there's some tons of E-Waste

568
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,120
generated but on the flip side it makes

569
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,299
people happy and interact and

570
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,380
yeah it teaches people yeah so there's

571
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,880
good and bad and

572
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,039
everything's good and bad right it's

573
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,580
just how it is I don't know because here

574
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,440
so yeah the clock pin doesn't exist on

575
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,779
the 2019 extenders because well the

576
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,860
clock pin didn't exist then so yeah I

577
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,000
hope it's not going to change anymore

578
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,760
because I hate changing that standard it

579
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,220
makes my life more difficult

580
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,380
um so yeah hopefully we won't make any

581
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,940
more changes to the mini badge standard

582
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,659
um thanks

583
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,910
[Applause]

584
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,059
thank you

585
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,000
why can't you did you do it

586
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,159
in here did we take Professor Plum off

587
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,620
I don't know this

588
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,559
this list this list changed so many

589
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,799
times

590
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,860
[Laughter]

591
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
yeah yeah

592
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
foreign

593
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,240
okay so the minibat standard was created

594
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,960
by Luke Jenkins in 2017.

595
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,700
and that was before I started doing the

596
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,620
same con badge

597
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,720
um I don't know if that predates the Sao

598
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,860
does anyone else

599
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,380
does it predate that and even then the

600
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,179
Defcon Sao thing is not an official

601
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,159
Defcon thing it was something that the

602
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,260
badge Life Community kind of created and

603
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,500
then Defcon kind of adopted-ish

604
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,659
it's weird I don't even know how to

605
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,860
explain that dynamic

606
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,039
I've seen it used on some unofficial

607
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,799
Defcon badges like the dc-801 badge for

608
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,480
Defcon usually has it on there because

609
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,740
you know

610
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,380
makes sense right

611
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,760
um but I haven't seen any others

612
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:23,880
oh

613
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,260
um

614
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,299
I say my favorite has to be the Enigma

615
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,200
veg

616
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
it was just it was awesome it was

617
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,960
beautiful and I got to use things that I

618
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,720
haven't used since College like in fpga

619
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,520
it was a lot of fun

620
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,080
and

621
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,840
that one created so much interaction

622
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,120
with everyone but it was just awesome

623
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,799
that's true the layers last year was a

624
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,100
lot of fun

625
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,820
oh no

626
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,900
that capacitive touch wheel was a

627
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,419
nightmare

628
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,799
Oh thanks thank you

629
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,080
is there a question over here sorry hand

630
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,918
oh yeah

631
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,840
yeah why did I add the rainbow mode

632
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,640
so you had something to unlock at the

633
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,840
end when you finish it

634
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,679
uh that is a

635
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,720
so holding the

636
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,760
is it up or down one of those buttons

637
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,380
when you turn it on

638
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,419
it will just flash red green and blue

639
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,299
and that is just an LED test so that

640
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,980
when you bring your badge to us and say

641
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,720
this isn't working right we can turn it

642
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,520
on and be like yes all the LEDs are

643
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
working or yeah those ones are broken

644
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,320
right especially if we're in the game is

645
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,659
based on you seeing an LED turn on to

646
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,580
tell you that something is not the right

647
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,399
answer so that was just a test mode the

648
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,140
rainbow mode when you finish is very

649
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,380
different

650
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,820
sorry

651
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,679
all right here oh yeah that is a debug

652
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,360
connector Port so it's actually the the

653
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,980
pads for it are on the back of the badge

654
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,320
for debug as for a tag connect connector

655
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,279
which is horribly expensive but it means

656
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,600
there's no physical connector on the

657
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,100
board so it doesn't cost anything per

658
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,899
board to put it on there

659
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,760
so that's what that is

660
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,820
other questions

661
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,559
okay

662
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,279
um

663
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,320
yeah I've got them all hanging up on my

664
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,740
wall in my office like like 12 feet

665
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,080
worth of just lanyards and badges all

666
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,639
across the wall yeah

667
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
yeah oh all right I guess we're over

668
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,680
time thank you everyone

669
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:21,030
[Applause]
