1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
all right I think you're all in the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,820
wrong presentation

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,919
um I will be upfront and honest that I

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,219
am a tad bit nervous so

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,860
um yeah welcome 10 communication tips

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,520
for new security managers

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
um

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
my name is Chase Palmer that's my lovely

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,340
picture over there

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,760
I am a senior security Analyst at Lucid

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,859
Software I've been there for uh just

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,560
about five years

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,320
um I've worked in GRC in one way or

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,079
another for the last 15 years

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,200
and I spent a great deal of time of that

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,079
15 years willing dealing with PCI

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,280
compliance

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
back when nobody has even heard of PCI

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
compliance I think we were on PCI

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
version 1.2

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
when I had started and now we're looking

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
at 4.0

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
um

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,780
I spent a short period of time working

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,879
for the government and I will never do

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,619
that again

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,580
um

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,740
uh that is uh

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,200
yeah that wasn't fun

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,119
um as I said I've been Lucid for about

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,520
five years now and uh I manage an

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,000
awesome team of security analysts

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
um and uh the last two items on my list

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,979
here I feel are just a bit obligatory I

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,299
am the founder of a nationally

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,119
recognized non-profit organization

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,360
and I do have my cisp certification I

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,619
used to have a slide in here that says

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,380
no that does not make me a hacker

40
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,180
because I am not a hacker

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,600
and we were getting that into that later

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,540
um so I want to know why you're here so

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,579
by raise of hands who here is seasoned

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,100
seasoned manager who's managed teams for

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,780
a while

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,220
okay

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,720
how many

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,000
um our new managers somebody in the last

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,240
couple years started managing

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
okay and then sorry the lights got down

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,579
now I can't see

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,240
um

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
how many are on track to become a

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,258
manager have career plans to become a

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,760
manager

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,739
good that's a lot

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,599
and how many of you are here to learn

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,940
lessons so that you can uh tell your

59
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,459
boss how to act properly there you go

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,160
that's everybody sweet

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,440
all right

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,819
um so one of the things I really like

63
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,940
about coming to security conferences is

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,680
we have an opportunity to connect and

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
discuss

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,180
certain topics we can agree we can agree

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,959
disagree we can agree to disagree

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,400
on different approaches to different

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
situations such as is it better to get

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
your ISO 27001 or is it better to go for

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,239
a sock two is fedrap really worth it

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,280
um do you pay the ransom if you get

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
ransomware

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,760
or if you're really clever do you Ransom

75
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,260
the ransomer

76
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,120
but

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,819
um so really unless you're out there to

78
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,040
watch the world burn we're all on the

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,379
same team and we have something to

80
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,140
contribute and to uh to learn from each

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,760
other

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,060
what this presentation is not is a

83
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,099
technical presentation I'm not going to

84
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,180
get into details about technical stuff

85
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,200
there are lots of technical

86
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
presentations

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,280
um and I will be the first to admit that

88
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,099
I really enjoy technical presentations

89
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,019
I'd rather be next door listening to

90
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,440
Troy talk about hacking Apple Air tags

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,080
or down in the communities

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
um

93
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,819
but

94
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,799
we go too far with technical

95
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,140
presentations if that's all we do it's

96
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,239
like skipping leg day and then we look

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,099
like this really cool fellow here who

98
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,900
could probably

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,360
um break my arm just by looking at me

100
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,620
but

101
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,680
um

102
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,420
um it leaves your security program a bit

103
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,299
unbalanced now in all fairness the other

104
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,000
way around if you don't focus on any

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,099
technical stuff

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,379
um you're it's just all policies and

107
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,879
nobody's doing anything there's no

108
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,739
enforcement and

109
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,659
you end up looking like this guy who

110
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,760
probably rides bikes

111
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,298
for a job or something

112
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,759
he probably has an easier time finding

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,960
um a shirt

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,060
than the other guy but I would imagine

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,320
it'd probably be really hard to find

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,680
pants

117
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,020
so before I get into the heart of the

118
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,060
presentation I'm going to start off by

119
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,100
saying that I am by no means an expert

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,979
in what I'm going to present today I'm

121
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,120
still learning a lot of this myself

122
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,800
this presentation is compiled from

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
things that I have learned from leaders

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
other leaders and from mentors in my

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,680
life

126
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,960
um but these aren't just theories these

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
have been tried and tested things and

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,880
have been proven to work

129
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,100
uh so I've tried to provide some

130
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,860
examples wherever I can about my

131
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,600
personal experience but where my

132
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,479
experience is lacking I've collected

133
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,419
some examples from others who have been

134
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,100
able to exemplify the principles that

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,120
were being discussed

136
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,520
I also want to emphasize this

137
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,440
knowing something and doing something

138
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,259
are two different things it's not enough

139
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,720
to sit here and learn something and say

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,940
oh that's great advice I could see how

141
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,620
that works and then not do anything

142
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,600
about it

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
so I personally still have a lot to work

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,220
in these areas

145
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,680
and if you find yourself saying Oh I

146
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,320
like that then do something about it you

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
won't regret it

148
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
so

149
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,919
if you want to get something take a

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,900
picture of this screen here and then you

151
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,419
can go typing on your laptop and ignore

152
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,639
me the rest of the presentation

153
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,720
but this is what we're going to talk

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,000
about these are my 10 communication tips

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,860
I'll give you a second I'll wait till

156
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,860
all the phones get put away

157
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,340
huh

158
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,199
okay got a straggler in the back there

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,740
good we good

160
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,259
there we go all right all right so we're

161
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,880
going to kick things off pretty strong

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
with our first tip and have uh which is

163
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,360
having uh risk-based discussions

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,120
all businesses face risk and what we do

165
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,639
as Security Professionals is mitigate or

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,340
reduce the the risks in within the

167
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,520
business

168
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,479
so when we associate tasks with risk

169
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,380
mitigation it's far easier to provide

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,440
um

171
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,460
it's a lot easier to illustrate the

172
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,739
reason for performing a particular task

173
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,020
um so tying tying a risk to a task helps

174
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,720
communicate that a lot a lot better

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,580
um

176
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,319
to take things a step further if your

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,020
supervisor or executive is involved in

178
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,199
security risks and helping identify them

179
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,539
and address them the sense of urgency to

180
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,300
complete a particular task may come a

181
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,699
lot easier

182
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,400
um Del Carnegie Illustrated this really

183
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,139
well in his book How to Win Friends and

184
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,479
Influence People when he said that when

185
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,220
you let other people feel that they came

186
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,319
up with the idea you'll get better

187
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
buy-in from the people that you're

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,280
trying to win win over to your way of

189
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,139
thinking so

190
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,960
get them involved

191
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
if you're not already performing risk

192
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,120
assessments within your organization you

193
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
want to start now you can start doing

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,080
things

195
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,479
in an informal way just by keeping notes

196
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,340
and and keeping track of them

197
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,039
something's always better than nothing

198
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,539
but eventually you'll want to work your

199
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,880
way to a more mature program that's

200
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,520
regularly identifying And discussing and

201
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
monitoring risks

202
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,419
risk assessments are great for

203
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,979
undercovering things that may have gone

204
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,740
unnoticed and some sometimes things that

205
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,259
people try to ignore or think will go

206
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,940
away

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,340
and risk assessments can be very

208
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,740
prescriptive depending on what framework

209
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,960
you're using but they're all pretty much

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
the same I identify an asset that you're

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,479
trying to protect

212
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,979
think about all the great and terrible

213
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,659
things that could happen to that asset

214
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,760
and then determine what the probability

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,979
and impact would be for that particular

216
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,099
scenario and assign a risk score

217
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,799
a key part of managing risks and

218
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,480
deciding what should be done at the

219
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
company and what that priority should be

220
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,800
is to have a risk statement

221
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,660
and that risk safety should be adopted

222
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,080
and approved by executive management

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
so here's an example of a risk appetite

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
statement

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,839
it establishes the scale in which the

226
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,220
risk will be measured

227
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,100
and which risk will be given the highest

228
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
priority

229
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,820
so an example of how this has worked

230
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,620
several years ago we had some employees

231
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,120
that were using their laptops for

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
displays at trade shows and and those

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,540
laptops they were being used to run

234
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
looping presentations

235
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,300
videos or even provide demonstrations

236
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,820
there was a lot of strong pushback from

237
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,180
the I.T and the sales team

238
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,800
when this was brought up

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,519
and we asked them to stop doing that

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,540
um

241
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,459
they argued that the cost of additional

242
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,680
Hardware to be able to have dedicated

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,459
hardware for presentations and such

244
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,500
was a

245
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,120
they're trying to keep track of multiple

246
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
laptops and that kind of thing it was

247
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,459
just too much

248
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,920
but when we talked about the risks

249
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,440
associated with having an unlocked

250
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,600
laptop

251
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,640
you know in in our sales people having

252
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,060
access to large amounts of data about

253
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,380
potential clients current clients

254
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,700
details of our service and pricing

255
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,380
lots of corporate data on their Google

256
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,660
Drives

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,339
um when they had their laptop sitting

258
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,200
there they had disabled the auto lock

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,680
feature and it's really easy if there's

260
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,120
a laptop sitting there you can get

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,160
distracted and let's see laptop walk off

262
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,200
um so

263
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
we

264
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,500
we assigned the probability

265
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,180
um that something like this was going to

266
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,980
happen

267
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,839
and gave it a risk score and it was

268
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,600
above our risk appetite and when we had

269
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,260
that discussion it became a lot more

270
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,160
apparent to both I.T and to the sales

271
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,040
team that we needed to have a different

272
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,019
solution for them so now we have

273
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,360
dedicated Hardware

274
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
that our sales team uses for presenting

275
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,579
at a or have at trade shows and

276
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,620
conferences that

277
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,079
um is pretty locked down can't can't

278
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,640
access anything it doesn't have any

279
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,140
access to any of our corporate data

280
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,160
all right move on to our second item

281
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,959
which is involving others in our

282
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,300
decisions

283
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,480
involving others when making decisions

284
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,000
um we're not talking about deciding what

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,899
you're going to eat for lunch

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,480
um or uh uh who's gonna

287
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,180
take the kids to school or something

288
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,459
like that what I'm referring to is

289
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,380
decisions like what security framework

290
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
should we use

291
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,760
should we Implement a new control that

292
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
requires you to re-authenticate your SSH

293
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,100
key every five minutes or you know what

294
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,260
be it

295
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,240
when you involve others in decision

296
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,660
making you're a not you are able to not

297
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,160
only get a different perspective of the

298
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,500
situation but you also get a lot more

299
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,279
detail so a case in point is we had two

300
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,140
systems each had a different

301
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,820
classification assigned to them so

302
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,160
they're processing different types of

303
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,120
data

304
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
uh we had a policy that dictated that

305
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,579
that dictated the frequency for session

306
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,480
timeouts and a decision was made to set

307
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,180
a timeout for service a for seven days

308
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,820
and service B had a timeout of 30 days

309
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,800
based on that policy

310
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,300
we started getting a number of

311
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,740
complaints

312
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,980
that people could no longer log in to

313
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,380
service a

314
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,779
after we dug into it it turned out that

315
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,139
service a access to service a was

316
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,720
dependent on the access to service B for

317
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,959
authentication they were tied together

318
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,019
um when service a would expire service B

319
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,180
wouldn't and so when somebody tried to

320
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,760
access service a service B would say

321
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,320
yeah you're you're good we've already

322
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
given you a cookie

323
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,000
so we don't need to give you another one

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,279
um it was only after somebody logged out

325
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,139
as service B

326
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,880
that they could re-log into service a

327
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,779
and refresh that that session

328
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,579
so even though

329
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,720
um

330
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
service a or service B had a more laxed

331
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,959
policy assigned to it it was determined

332
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,120
that it was going to be a lot easier for

333
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,880
us if we tied the two together and so

334
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,279
service B

335
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,220
had a more restricted timeout assigned

336
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,660
to it so we didn't run into problems

337
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,279
with service a

338
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,920
if we had involved the users of service

339
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,800
a into the discussion before we made the

340
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,079
decision to set the session expirations

341
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,120
we would have avoided some heartache

342
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,240
some headache

343
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,399
this is a simple example as a relatively

344
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,040
small impact on some productivity but

345
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
other decisions could have a greater

346
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,339
impact

347
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,899
what if someone decided that a

348
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,519
particular database was no longer needed

349
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,860
and decided to drop it only to find out

350
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,139
that certain historical data was being

351
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,000
kept in that database now hopefully

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
you've got a backup of that that

353
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
database that can be restored but what

354
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,660
if there wasn't

355
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,700
so involving others and decisions can

356
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,160
help in revealing details about a

357
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,500
situation that was previously unknown

358
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,480
another benefit of getting someone

359
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,180
involved in the decision and making a

360
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,420
decision-making process

361
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,920
especially if that person is in your

362
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,180
downline is that you'll get better

363
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,160
buy-in on the decisions since they

364
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,800
played a part in making that decision

365
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,139
those who are involved feel a much

366
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,180
stronger connection to the decision and

367
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,339
want to be a part of making it happen

368
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,459
okay tip number three is we've talked

369
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,839
about a little bit and back up your

370
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,540
decisions with policy

371
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,720
as security governance is Central is the

372
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,100
central glue that holds a good security

373
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,680
program together

374
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,199
policies shouldn't though be arbitrary

375
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,300
rules to force employees to march in

376
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,060
order under your dictatorship

377
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,100
but rather they are previously agreed

378
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,139
upon decisions that are made to mitigate

379
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,360
risks within the organization

380
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,920
without security governance

381
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,660
organizations can make widely different

382
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,240
decisions based on the time of day the

383
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,680
food they ate or the mood that

384
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,120
somebody's in

385
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,040
this creates a bit of chaos and sends

386
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,699
the organization down an aimless path

387
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,980
security governance helps bring

388
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,620
consistency to decisions and provides

389
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,040
the map that will guide future decisions

390
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,040
policies not only make decisions easier

391
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,779
but it provides a certain level of

392
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,120
protection to the organization in a

393
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,300
legal sense and its employee protects

394
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,540
the organization and the employees

395
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,399
um so if you remember our the story it

396
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,600
shouldn't have been too hard to remember

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,060
it was only a few slides back uh the

398
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,680
employees were disabling the auto lock

399
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
feature on their laptops

400
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,180
for those those trade shows

401
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,820
the auto lock is a technical control

402
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,279
that is used as a contingency for

403
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,779
someone forgets to lock their computer

404
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,820
when they walk away

405
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,560
but it's also a deterrent for thieves

406
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,180
since they have a very limited window

407
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,800
for an opportunity

408
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,800
and if the functions if it's functioning

409
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,720
properly closing the lid will

410
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,060
immediately require a password to unlock

411
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,459
it again this is a pretty basic control

412
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,800
it's built into most security Frameworks

413
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
and it's considered a best practice

414
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,199
when it came to that particular

415
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,320
situation it would made it a lot easier

416
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,360
to decide what to do because we had made

417
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,579
the decision a long time ago that it was

418
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,399
important that we lock our computers

419
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,199
and so it provided a guide for us to

420
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,899
show that was important to the company

421
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,620
that we needed to go down a certain path

422
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,120
and those policies were

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,319
reviewed and approved by our executive

424
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,099
team

425
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,919
so we had executive buy-in

426
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,959
now sometimes policies don't fit every

427
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,179
situation and exceptions need to be made

428
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,419
a proper policy proper policy program

429
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,220
will have an exception process

430
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,260
but every exception should be reviewed

431
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,959
on a regular basis an exception should

432
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,299
be relatively rare if you find that in

433
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,480
exceptions to policies are becoming the

434
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,799
rule

435
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,140
might be worth revisiting a policy and

436
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,020
determining what the risk is

437
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,900
that is driving the policy and adjust

438
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,419
either adjust your risk appetite or the

439
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,820
policy needs to be Rewritten to reflect

440
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,960
the expected Behavior

441
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,500
this is a tough one admit that things

442
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,059
can be approved

443
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,220
as much as we like to believe that we

444
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,100
have the best security program out there

445
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,380
there's always so much more to do

446
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,860
and the go floats are always moving

447
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,140
things are inevitably going to fall

448
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,120
short and it's best to admit that things

449
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
can improve than to try and justify our

450
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
current state of affairs as being good

451
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,340
enough

452
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,220
so tip four is admit that things can be

453
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,700
improved

454
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,260
so we live in a world where technology

455
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,600
is changing so fast that it's impossible

456
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,880
to keep up

457
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,120
starting to feel like my dad

458
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,740
sometimes where I can't figure out how

459
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,820
to do things

460
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,860
I don't do social media I don't know how

461
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,600
to use Instagram I don't know how to use

462
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
Facebook

463
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,679
so I might now sympathize with my with

464
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,100
my dad

465
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,039
um

466
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,440
but Bad actors are always finding new

467
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,140
ways to exploit systems faster than we

468
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,720
can fix them so it's important to say

469
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,700
that whenever security controls are in

470
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,400
place at our organization sorry it's

471
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,980
impossible to say that our security

472
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,400
controls are perfect and that there

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
would be no room for improvement

474
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,140
I don't know how many of you have been

475
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,020
involved in audits but audits can be a

476
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,200
root an eye-opener and a truth teller

477
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,960
about how comfortable you really are

478
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,980
with uh with your security controls

479
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,100
I've been involved with lots of audits

480
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,640
um

481
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,580
and there have been several times where

482
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,900
there have been concerns from the

483
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,280
auditor

484
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,059
um

485
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,840
that or from the auditor and from others

486
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,059
within the company that controls were

487
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,120
being bent to fit our current practice

488
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,940
and we were trying to convince ourselves

489
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,799
and in turn trying to convince the

490
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,080
auditor that what we were doing was

491
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,700
meeting the control

492
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,320
when it probably wasn't

493
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,299
um or we have a control but it's not

494
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,100
operating correctly nobody's following

495
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,080
it and we're not addressing the real

496
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,120
issue

497
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,780
um

498
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,059
I've

499
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,160
I've started to come up with a term for

500
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,960
this I call it squinting squinting at

501
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,120
controls

502
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,820
and if I squint hard enough

503
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,940
I maybe I can make an unrelated practice

504
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,679
fit into a control

505
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,380
so I always try to avoid squinting at

506
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,039
controls when I'm in an audit

507
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,100
but there's also a natural tendency for

508
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,140
us to see Auditors as enemies rather

509
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,640
than allies

510
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,640
uh when I approach an audit I try to see

511
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,740
it as an opportunity to get an external

512
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,860
perspective on our security controls

513
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,360
and if an auditor believes that

514
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,980
something may not be satisfying the

515
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,080
control I see it as an opportunity to

516
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,059
improve and make things better

517
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,039
but don't get me wrong I don't roll over

518
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
when every time an auditor to bring

519
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,820
something up and we disagree

520
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,860
especially if I believe that a control

521
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,160
actually satisfies or a process actually

522
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,020
satisfies the control

523
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,120
but I will bring it up with the I don't

524
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,059
know how a discussion with the auditor

525
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,500
um what usually happens is those

526
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,299
discussions usually come down to what

527
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,700
the underlying risk is going back to our

528
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,940
first communication tip

529
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,200
so what are the risks and the control

530
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,299
and what is the control trying to

531
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,340
mitigate

532
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,860
when we uncover the risk that was

533
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,960
driving the control we have more a much

534
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,000
more productive conversation and we can

535
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,559
demonstrate to the auditor that what we

536
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,260
have is in fact meeting the control it

537
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,299
may not be exactly as the control is

538
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,020
written in a particular standard

539
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,659
but we are meeting the spirit of it and

540
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,440
we are in fact mitigating that risk

541
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,539
but in cases where we aren't addressing

542
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,520
the risk we use it as an opportunity to

543
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,460
mature

544
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,020
but now I'm sure there's some of you out

545
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,400
there that are shaking your heads and I

546
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,280
will admit sometimes you really get a

547
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,780
sadistic auditor

548
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,840
that just wants to see you squirm

549
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,020
and if your control isn't implemented

550
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,240
exactly as it's written

551
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,220
they're going to flag you and there's

552
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,620
nothing you can do about it

553
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,240
um

554
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,380
but that's a whole different

555
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,059
communication tip and we're not going to

556
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,580
cover it in this presentation so but I

557
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,500
do know they exist I've been involved in

558
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,460
them

559
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,059
um and it kind of sucks so

560
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,120
okay

561
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,380
this one

562
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm sure of you few of you out there are

563
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,539
looking at this and like why would I

564
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:34,080
fail on purpose that sounds stupid

565
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
um and to be honest when I first heard

566
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,780
this that's exactly what I thought

567
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,179
um but it may not be what you uh what

568
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,620
you're expecting

569
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,220
um but it is our number five tip our

570
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,100
fifth tip is to fail proactively

571
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,440
is anybody out there has anybody heard

572
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,059
of this feeling proactively

573
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,860
just a couple I'm guessing

574
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,659
um you're probably involved in

575
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,460
programming

576
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,799
or something

577
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,880
um

578
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,400
so this is from Google

579
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,620
Google states that proactive failure is

580
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,720
the practice of generating notifications

581
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,659
when monitoring values approach a known

582
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,000
failure threshold and not waiting for

583
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,620
the system to alert you that has already

584
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
failed our worst to find out from

585
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,280
customers that your application or

586
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,000
service is down

587
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,940
um

588
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,640
we can apply this to our professional

589
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,820
lives not just a technical

590
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,260
or

591
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,580
a

592
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,559
an application sending logs and

593
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,820
monitoring those logs this is

594
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,360
communicating with others that

595
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,620
um

596
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,780
that something is going to fail ahead of

597
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,120
time before it fails

598
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,159
so it's a natural tendency for us to

599
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,620
want to impress our superiors and take

600
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,799
on everything that comes our way

601
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,659
and we want to be seen as yes people and

602
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,039
not know people

603
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
Security Professionals I think we all

604
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,500
get the the reputation that we shut

605
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,880
things down because we're terrible

606
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,780
people

607
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,780
and we want to fix that as human beings

608
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,820
we seek out praise and oftentimes we

609
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,919
feel like being agreeing to serve being

610
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,539
agreeable to something

611
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,120
we will get that praise the problem is

612
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,820
is we can at least get we can easily get

613
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,340
to the point where we take we've taken

614
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,020
on too much

615
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,179
and we'll end up doing more harm than

616
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,140
good

617
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,720
disappointment is defined as a failure

618
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,179
to meet expectations so if you want to

619
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,400
avoid disappointing somebody set the

620
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,980
proper expectation and this is where the

621
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,960
concept of proactive failure comes into

622
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,159
play

623
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,380
it's better to communicate failure early

624
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,539
on than it is to wait until a deadline

625
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,120
closes in or is even passed

626
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,039
by citing the correct expectation from

627
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,600
the beginning we communicate our

628
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,120
capacity for our workload

629
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,100
does this mean that we have to turn down

630
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,260
work that may get assigned to somebody

631
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,799
else yes maybe sometimes

632
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,960
but that's not always the case

633
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,760
so here's an example

634
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,320
and this actually happened recently

635
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,580
halfway through a fiscal quarter I was

636
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,860
approached by our legal team

637
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,500
and they asked me if my team could do an

638
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,900
audit of

639
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,240
37 customer contracts to validate that

640
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,240
we are continuing to be compliant with

641
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
the terms laid out in the contract

642
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
the request to get these they originally

643
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,140
requested these to be done by the end of

644
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,820
the quarter so about a month and a half

645
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,799
to take the project on would require us

646
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,659
to put some of our current projects on

647
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:40,440
hold

648
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,179
and that would mean that we would miss

649
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,179
our okr goals for the quarter

650
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,220
so my response back to the legal team

651
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,559
was to explain the situation

652
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,260
I was in an agreement so I agreed that a

653
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,880
review of the contracts was important

654
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,520
and beneficial and needed to be done

655
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,500
however

656
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,419
I wasn't sure it was possible for us to

657
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,460
accomplish the task in the given time

658
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,580
frame and that it didn't it wasn't more

659
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,279
important than the current

660
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,900
work that we were doing

661
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,539
so I had proactively failed the task

662
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,880
that was presented to me and as it

663
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,760
turned out after additional conversation

664
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,159
there was no urgent need to accomplish

665
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,440
the task and in return we were asked to

666
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,120
set the time frame on when we could get

667
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,440
it accomplished

668
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,779
by communicating the probable failure of

669
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,820
the project from the beginning we were

670
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,279
able to set the proper expectation and

671
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,020
priorities for our work preventing the

672
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,779
team from having to work extra hours

673
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,880
to accomplish everything that was on our

674
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
plate

675
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,500
in a lot of cases such as the one I just

676
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,720
shared the timing of a task is

677
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,980
negotiable

678
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,720
so no need to work yourself to the Bone

679
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
for no reason all you're doing is

680
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,279
setting precedent for future situations

681
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,760
and that can be hard to undo so what can

682
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,400
we do about those cases where timing is

683
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,640
not negotiable and you have to Pivot

684
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,480
proactively fail

685
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,340
when you know that something has to give

686
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,500
it's better to notify those stakeholders

687
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,900
or the project or tasks that you have to

688
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,260
give up or delay to notify them early on

689
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,740
and explain the situation to them

690
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,480
so it's always better to communicate a

691
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,400
failure early on than it is to wait for

692
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,980
the deadline to pass and that sets the

693
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,140
correct expectation

694
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,240
and sets the right capacity planning for

695
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,539
your team

696
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,240
so communicating failure is not a sign

697
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,880
of weakness or an aptitude but the

698
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,299
failure to communicate is

699
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,820
okay this might also be another hard one

700
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,559
for people you don't have to be the

701
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,360
smartest person in the room I struggle

702
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
with this one

703
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,158
um

704
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,480
but and it's common I think we hear it a

705
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,380
lot but I think we need the reminder

706
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,039
there are so many Specialties within uh

707
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,120
security

708
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,039
and I would venture to say that none of

709
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,440
us is ever going to have a full in-depth

710
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,480
knowledge of every single aspect of

711
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,360
information system security

712
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,860
um

713
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,580
that's a lot

714
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,200
you'll probably have a good amount of

715
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,820
knowledge about or an extensive

716
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,140
knowledge about one or two of these

717
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,279
areas

718
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,860
a good deal of knowledge in a couple of

719
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,480
others and a high level knowledge of

720
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,460
just about everything else

721
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,440
it's more likely that you'll have to

722
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,440
have people that report to you that know

723
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,140
more about a subject than you

724
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,159
and that might be why you hired them

725
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,960
doesn't make sense to hire smart people

726
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,179
and tell them what to do we hire smart

727
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,480
people so they can tell us what to do

728
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,279
so being a leader doesn't mean that you

729
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,200
have to know everything it means that

730
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,559
you know what resources you have

731
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,080
who have particular skills and then

732
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,620
leverage those skills to succeed when

733
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,200
your directs when you win

734
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,580
that doesn't mean that you don't have

735
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,380
something to contribute just don't

736
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,419
dismiss someone else's expertise because

737
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,799
you feel like you have to be the

738
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,140
smartest person if you're consistently

739
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,140
in a room asserting that you know best

740
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,580
you'll just become

741
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,500
you'll just come across like this cute

742
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,940
little guy on the slide

743
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,720
okay tip number seven

744
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,159
um I struggled with this a lot when I

745
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,779
started managing

746
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,179
and I still have a lot of work to do

747
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,159
with this one

748
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,460
um we need to have direct solve problems

749
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,399
as a manager you may have this sense

750
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,220
that you have to be the hero

751
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,960
that steps in and solves all the

752
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,700
problems that arise

753
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,500
what you may not know is that you're

754
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,899
actually doing more harm than good

755
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,820
when you try and solve the problems that

756
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,418
your teams face

757
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,500
when you're seen as the only person that

758
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,000
can solve a problem you have set

759
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
yourself and your team up for failure

760
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,260
not only are you now a single point of

761
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,480
failure for your team but you're also

762
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,100
stifling the growth of those who report

763
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,500
to you they won't learn the skills they

764
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,740
need in order to solve problems

765
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,539
I'll hold on to this slide for just a

766
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,679
sec I'm just not going to read it

767
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,640
so there's a really cool article

768
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,679
um called who's got the monkey by

769
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,120
William ankin and Donald L Wass it was

770
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,580
in the Harvard Business Business Review

771
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,080
in the article the authors share a story

772
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,520
of the manager who would take upon

773
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,380
himself to solve the problems that his

774
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,000
team came across

775
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,980
he would put in long hours and stay well

776
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,320
after his employees had left the office

777
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,059
he began to realize that while he was

778
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,860
stuck in the office solving the problems

779
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,260
for his employees they were at home

780
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,940
enjoying time with their families doing

781
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,460
their hobbies and socializing

782
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,440
he decided that this wasn't fair and it

783
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,419
needed to make a change

784
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,059
the authors then share the analogy of

785
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,640
tasks being like monkeys we all have

786
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,020
monkeys on our back that need to be

787
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,360
taken care of they need to be fed they

788
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,500
need to be taken out to go to the

789
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,340
bathroom

790
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,620
they need to

791
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,440
play I guess

792
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,520
but the author shares the analogy of

793
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,679
that when we approach somebody else with

794
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,120
a problem

795
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,460
and we want them to solve it we are

796
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,899
handing that monkey off to the other

797
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,820
person to take care of

798
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,740
and when we take care of other people's

799
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,360
monkeys we're not able to take care of

800
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,500
our own

801
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,299
things as simple as let me look into

802
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,700
that for you or let me see what I can do

803
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,500
our bait for monkeys and they will

804
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,419
always find a comfortable place on your

805
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,159
shoulder and demand your time and your

806
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,539
attention

807
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,159
so the recommendation here is to be

808
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,559
careful about what monkeys you take on

809
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,120
from your directs

810
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,039
one way to fend off those monkeys is

811
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,299
pretty simple

812
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,220
ask questions

813
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,020
in a leadership course that I attended

814
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,940
the instructor instructor challenged us

815
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,039
challenged us the next time we had a

816
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,960
problem brought to us that rather than

817
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,659
offer up suggestions or make any

818
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,080
statements only ask questions

819
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,880
asking questions will force the other

820
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,260
person to really think about the

821
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,600
situation and a lot of time they'll be

822
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,399
able to come up the right conclusion

823
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,340
keep in mind that it's not perfect

824
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,419
sometimes the direct doesn't have the

825
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,340
knowledge to solve the problem or

826
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,600
they've come up with a really terrible

827
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,919
solution

828
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,140
but hopefully that those situations are

829
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,360
the exception and not the rule the more

830
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,860
you do this the more confidence you'll

831
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,480
give your directs and fewer problems

832
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,740
will need to be brought to your

833
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,159
attention

834
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,580
okay this one Matt I keep saying this is

835
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,100
they're hard

836
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,820
um

837
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,100
communicate business impact in familiar

838
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,340
terms this is avoiding jargon

839
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,380
it's really easy for us when we work in

840
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,820
highly technical fields to spout off

841
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,640
um I can't think of anything off the top

842
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
of my head but we can really confuse

843
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,820
people

844
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,919
um in fact

845
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,779
um

846
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,299
some people use technical speak to sound

847
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,740
smart

848
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,480
it may work for those who are not

849
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,100
familiar with the topic at hand but

850
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,200
Studies have shown that the overuse of

851
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,179
technical jargon actually indicates that

852
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,919
the speaker isn't actually sure about

853
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,840
what they're talking about

854
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
and it's really unnecessary to

855
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
complicate a conversation that could be

856
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,200
held in simpler terms

857
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,720
so I think this video will do a good job

858
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,340
at demonstrating what it feels like to

859
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,320
be someone when someone is speaking to

860
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,600
them in unfamiliar terms I hope this

861
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,918
works we tried this

862
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:52,140
[Music]

863
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,559
the original machine had a base plate of

864
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,140
pre-familated amulyte surmounted by a

865
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,419
malleable logarithmic casing in such a

866
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,760
way that the two spurving bearings run a

867
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,480
direct line with a panometric fan

868
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,940
yes that was once me extolling the

869
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,760
virtues of retro-encabulation now I may

870
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,320
not be The Dashing Young on-camera

871
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,899
narrator I once was but if history tells

872
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,460
me anything it's that the Battle of

873
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,040
Hastings was fought in 1066 but that's

874
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,659
not the point

875
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,418
the point is that encapulation has a

876
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,280
rich Sumptuous history with a delicate

877
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,679
flaky crust relatively unknown to

878
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,560
emergent cyber security personnel

879
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,719
allow me to elucidate

880
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,000
the discovery of encapsulation was quite

881
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,980
accidental when engineers in the skunk

882
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,679
works at Mutual poly Dynamics coupled a

883
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,780
transcendental Hopper data scope with a

884
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,879
spiral decommutator via the application

885
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,119
of anhydrous angling pins resulting

886
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,099
text that allowed frenetic mastication

887
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,280
and alarming speeds the device was Kept

888
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,020
Secret for many years owing to the

889
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,060
horrific accident that occurred shortly

890
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,640
after its Inception house home ever the

891
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,200
U.S compartment of offense and the

892
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,420
natural guard soon realized its

893
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,119
potential as a weapon of choice leading

894
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,220
to its next iteration the hydro

895
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,619
encapsulator which they nicknamed Fatboy

896
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,200
Slim understanding the grizzly bear fact

897
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,640
of the devastation that would result

898
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,619
from its deployment the project was

899
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,359
retubed and transmogrified for

900
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,880
industrial supplications this version

901
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,579
known as the pseudoencabulator was the

902
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,200
infernal Palestine engine that allowed

903
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,119
post-war America to realize its

904
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,339
aspirations and become the domino player

905
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,980
on the world stage everybody was

906
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,380
encapsulating I don't understand you

907
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,119
well I knew you wouldn't but if I'd told

908
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,380
you before the ants meter on the other

909
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,579
side cranulates the canoe to spell

910
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:39,780
happiness and that's the entire secret

911
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,880
there you have it during the tumultuous

912
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,520
60s the psychophuncadelic vinyl

913
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,800
encapulator emerged as the long-haired

914
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,060
hippie people's answer to their parents

915
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,060
aging technology scarving a resonance

916
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,800
Groove in the hot wax of a new

917
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
generation of encapsulators however

918
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,240
interested in tabulation waned

919
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,400
precipitously until the late 80s when

920
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,980
the public was ready for the next

921
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,440
transubstantiation of encapsulation

922
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,820
extraordinarily populist turbo

923
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,640
encabulator now basically the only new

924
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,740
principle involved is that instead of

925
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,660
power being generated by the relative

926
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,660
motion of conductors and fluxes it is

927
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,020
produced by the modal interaction of

928
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,099
magnetorectance and capacitive

929
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,660
directives

930
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,599
which brings us to where we are today

931
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,740
floundering in the wake of the obscenely

932
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,140
similar retro encapulator featuring

933
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,660
yours truly living proof that leveraging

934
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,260
existing assets is not plagiarism

935
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,839
now despite encabulation's unparalleled

936
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,579
success in reducing sinusoidal

937
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,380
depleneration through advanced Dingle

938
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,900
arm technology it has failed to meet the

939
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,640
unanticipated needs of the cyber

940
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,160
security industry to create zero trust

941
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,200
operations in level zero monitoring

942
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,540
environments to ameliorate zero-day

943
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,480
process attacks that is why despite zero

944
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
interest from industry the Sands ICS

945
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,579
security team and upon themselves to

946
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,740
develop an entirely new level of

947
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,260
encabulation unresponsive to the needs

948
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,480
of the average consumer and undoubtedly

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,920
present the hyperencabulator

955
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,300
foreign

956
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:30,900
ER is nothing less than a key ruminant

957
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,220
in the advancement of retrograde

958
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,980
phenomenology by which we can achieve

959
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,079
plastic and sinus and clastic

960
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,000

reality and ai-informed modalities

962
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,220
you'll note that the hyperencabulator

963
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,160
utilizes indiscrete modules making

964

as you can see the hyper-encabulator has

998
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,359
reached a high level of development

999
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,579
whereas previous dissimilar devices

supply chain s-bombs the

1003
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,099
hyperencabulator operates totally under

1004
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,020
the principle of colonica fluvium

Thomas Edison once said that invention

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,200
was 10 percent inspiration and 90

1009

perspiration if that's the case Thomas

1010
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,380
Edison should have invented deodorant

1011
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,119
but I regress

1012
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,700
in the near future hyperencabulation

1013
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,859
will ultimately replace all traditional

1014
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,140
cyber security safeguarding processes

1015
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,660
with osculating segmentation and

1016
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,000
entropic estrogation making what was

1017
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,099
once thought to be impossible

1018
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,900
probable

1019
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,599
at Sans ICS security when we're not

1020
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,980
innovating

1021
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,830
we're encapsulating

1022
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:06,348
[Music]

1023
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,579
oh there we go so

1024
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,960
um I don't know about you but if

1025
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,460
somebody stood up in a keynote and

1026
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,900
presented that whole entire thing

1027
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,359
memorized I would be impressed

1028
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,800
but

1029
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,599
um I thought about trying to do that

1030
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
here but it was gonna it was gonna fail

1031
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
horribly so

1032
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,420
um so yeah

1033
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,880
talking to familiar terms

1034
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,640
um it may at first make it sound like

1035
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,800
you're smart but in the end it's just

1036
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,079
going to make you sound really dumb

1037
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,760
oh there we go

1038
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,099
all right the rest of the presentation

1039
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,900
is not as entertaining I promise I'm

1040
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,520
sorry

1041
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,680
um so we need a

1042
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,300
start oh sorry okay I'm off track

1043
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,760
um create a vision and a road map

1044
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,280
so start with why figure out how to

1045
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,660
align your goals with your company's

1046
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,020
goals

1047
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,839
um

1048
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,579
and let's see

1049
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,500
and then regular review that roadmap and

1050
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,520
make sure necessary adjustments are made

1051
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,800
road maps communicate not only to your

1052
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,720
team but also to

1053
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,520
um

1054
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,900
stakeholders Executives on the

1055
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,460
directions that you'd like to go over a

1056
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,500
particular period of time

1057
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,060
and it can be a little bit difficult

1058
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,820
when

1059
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,339
we developed a road map the first thing

1060
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,160
we did is we in this top left yeah

1061
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,220
that's left and the top left corner uh

1062
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,040
we took a bunch of different Frameworks

1063
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,960
different assets

1064
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,900
um different things and we went through

1065
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,760
them and decided or found areas that we

1066
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,079
were lacking in

1067
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,839
and through those some sticky notes

1068
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,359
and categorize them we then took all

1069
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,940
those sticky notes and stuck them in

1070
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,960
a matrix that was rated off of the

1071
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,060
impact or the value to the company and

1072
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,880
the difficulty it was to

1073
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,940
to implement that particular item

1074
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,180
and then we took those items focusing on

1075
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,160
the bottom right quadrant which is going

1076
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,640
to be low difficulty with high impact

1077
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
and laid those out into a linear

1078
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,140
timeline

1079
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,420
trying to figure out what things we

1080
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,720
should work on now this this was it's

1081
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,520
worked really really well for us we have

1082
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,320
a good road map of where we want to go

1083
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,660
but we're constantly needing to make it

1084
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,000
needing to make adjustments to it as new

1085
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,780
things arise we get different

1086
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,119
requests from customers and whatnot but

1087
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,579
it's it's a good way to to see where we

1088
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:43,440
need to go

1089
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,839
and and how to communicate that to

1090
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,859
involved parties

1091
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,440
all right and this is our last one

1092
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,820
engage and give feedback

1093
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,319
this was a this was a principle that I

1094
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,200
unfortunately didn't learn about until

1095
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,900
um a few years back

1096
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,859
um

1097
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,319
but being engaged in the work of your

1098
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,540
direct report sounds easy

1099
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,599
but from my personal experience making a

1100
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,520
transition from being an individual

1101
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,400
contributor to a people manager is not

1102
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,780
easy

1103
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,940
for the longest time I had been an

1104
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,619
individual contributor

1105
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,359
I was in charge of my own work and I got

1106
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,460
my work done

1107
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,740
I knew how to do my work and what was

1108
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,578
efficient for me

1109
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,079
and then what seemed like overnight I

1110
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,319
was managing a team of four and I found

1111
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,180
it difficult to trust my team to get

1112
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,040
things done but this wasn't because that

1113
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,780
I felt like they were untalented or

1114
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,280
untrustworthy

1115
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,319
it was because I didn't think that they

1116
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,839
could do the things the way I did them

1117
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,480
and so there was a tendency to hold on

1118
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,339
to the things that I did as an

1119
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,040
individual contributor

1120
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,980
and failed to make the transition to a

1121
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,839
manager

1122
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,300
so at first

1123
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,680
it may make you feel important that you

1124
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,480
contribute your contributions are

1125
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,560
valuable

1126
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,079
but in the end as I said it before the

1127
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,579
opposite is true

1128
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,319
the more that you hold on to the work

1129
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,079
that you feel that only you can do the

1130
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,640
less engaged you're going to be with the

1131
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,680
work of those that report to you

1132
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,839
as you disengage from the team several

1133
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,579
things begin to happen

1134
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,140
employees will begin to feel that

1135
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,480
they're not valued that they are seen

1136
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,460
that they're not seen or heard

1137
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,800
they will and this will compound over

1138
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,900
time and they'll fill a disconnect from

1139
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,359
you as their manager and fail to bring

1140
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,520
up things that are important to them and

1141
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,339
their satisfaction and their job

1142
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,920
second employees don't receive the

1143
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,859
necessary feedback to help them grow

1144
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,319
if feedback doesn't happen

1145
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,040
um

1146
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,079
the employee won't feel that the

1147
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,000
feedback or sorry

1148
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,880
my notes are really weird here

1149
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,260
um

1150
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,140
all right okay if regular feedback's not

1151
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,540
happening when feedback does happen to

1152
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,220
be given the employees won't fill it the

1153
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,079
feedback is genuine

1154
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,660
and the feedback will and if the

1155
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,040
feedback includes correction they won't

1156
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,760
take it seriously

1157
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,140
and finally the team will feel like they

1158
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,060
don't have a direction and the team will

1159
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,740
no longer fill or function as a team

1160
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,599
so now you might be asking yourself but

1161
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,040
what about the work that you were doing

1162
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,380
before the answer is delegate it

1163
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,480
delegate that work and be engaged with

1164
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,520
the team as they work to figure it out

1165
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,859
and give regular feedback to the team

1166
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,420
members to help guide them and direct

1167
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,240
them and get to know your team members

1168
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,920
so that they feel comfortable in

1169
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,740
bringing questions and concerns to you

1170
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,319
that will help the team feel valued and

1171
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,180
they'll feel that they can trust they

1172
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,980
can trust you to have their best

1173
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,020
interests in mind

1174
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,420
as a manager your your performance isn't

1175
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,520
measured by what you do individually but

1176
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,319
how you guide your team and what you're

1177
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,780
able to achieve together

1178
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,940
so a real life example from a friend of

1179
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,720
mine

1180
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,119
kind of puts this in perspective

1181
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,440
he was a manager of a front-end

1182
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,780
engineering team and his colleague was

1183
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,819
the manager of a back-end team

1184
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,980
the two site basically two sides of the

1185
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,260
same coin it was critical that both

1186
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,599
teams worked together to make things

1187
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,339
work smoothly

1188
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,619
my friend spent each time or spent time

1189
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,060
each week meeting with his team and

1190
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,940
one-on-ones daily stand-ups

1191
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,460
and discuss their projects provided

1192
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,960
critical feedback to them to help them

1193
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,060
grow and be better

1194
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,800
the back-end manager took a very

1195
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,599
different approach he believed that

1196
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,579
telling people what to do lowered their

1197
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,520
job satisfaction as well as his own He

1198
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
was largely absent from everything

1199
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,920
all he was doing was approving time off

1200
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,839
the team

1201
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,839
um

1202
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,000
and they never pushed them to be better

1203
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,040
as time progressed the collaboration

1204
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,260
with between the two teams began to

1205
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,520
deteriorate

1206
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,220
the back end apis were designed created

1207
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,480
and deployed without the front-end

1208
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,859
team's knowledge

1209
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,920
features started to break backwards

1210
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,780
compatibility no longer functioned

1211
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,599
and customers started complaining

1212
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,099
my friend tried meeting with the

1213
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,660
back-end manager to resolve the problem

1214
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,119
but the back-end manager refused to step

1215
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,020
in

1216
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,880
eventually the back-end manager was let

1217
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,619
go and the two teams merged under the

1218
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,240
management of my friend

1219
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
this was a shock to the back end team

1220
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,780
who became very comfortable with the

1221
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,579
laissez-faire approach

1222
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,380
that when the structure was eventually

1223
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,180
brought back into

1224
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,280
that when structure was brought back

1225
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,020
into the mix several of the team members

1226
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,160
quit

1227
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,319
the ones who stayed felt relieved with

1228
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,380
the changed under the previous manager

1229
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,700
they explained that there was no

1230
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,440
Direction no accountability and no

1231
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,079
growth it was absolutely every man for

1232
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,839
themselves and it was exhausting

1233
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,760
under my friends management

1234
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,740
the remaining back-end developers once

1235
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,900
again felt part of a team that worked

1236
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,280
together rather than against each other

1237
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,920
as a result productivity increased and

1238
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,260
the product began to work again properly

1239
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,420
and customers were satisfied

1240
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,400
so my tips here

1241
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,220
are one to be engaged with your team two

1242
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,560
regularly meet with your team and try to

1243
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,420
make this a daily occurrence especially

1244
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,720
if anybody on the team is working remote

1245
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,480
uh meet regularly with each team member

1246
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,180
individually

1247
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,380
my recommendation is made at least

1248
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,319
weekly and keep to that schedule and let

1249
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,420
them drive that discussion so have

1250
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,160
one-on-ones

1251
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,500
and finally give regular meaningful

1252
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,079
feedback to the team and team members to

1253
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,180
help them grow this is different than

1254
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,260
criticism

1255
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,300
there's no such thing as positive or

1256
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,060
constructive criticism criticism does

1257
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,740
not come from the heart and rarely

1258
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,260
results in positive results

1259
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,180
when feedback is delivered correctly and

1260
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,099
consistently those on the receiving end

1261
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,300
will know

1262
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,339
that you mean well and that you are on

1263
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,700
their side

1264
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,619
and terrible transition to the end

1265
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,920
so

1266
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,079
um

1267
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,060
um I will be around if you have any

1268
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,460
questions about I won't answer questions

1269
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,680
up here because it makes me too nervous

1270
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,180
so

1271
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,740
yeah thanks for thanks for coming

1272
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,819
appreciate it
