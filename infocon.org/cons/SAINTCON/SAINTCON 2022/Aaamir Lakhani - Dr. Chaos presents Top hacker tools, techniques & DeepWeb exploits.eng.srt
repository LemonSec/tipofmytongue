[Music]

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,960
come on that was weak you guys can do

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
better

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,599
[Applause]

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,059
all right all right now I feel like

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,799
I'm crazy so wait that's a dental

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,000
service attack right there it's not

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
staying up all right guys uh so uh my

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,820
name is Amar lakhani uh that is actually

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,619
how you say my name

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,420
um you know my sister's name is Sarah I

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,800
was asked like Dad what the heck

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,660
happened like couldn't could have named

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,980
me something easier

16
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,000
um you know he always told me he's like

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,460
I named you after a player uh in

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,960
Pakistan when he went to the when we

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,000
when they went to the World Cup I was

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
like that's great man I love soccer and

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,420
he's like no not that World Cup the

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,739
Cricket World Cup I was like what the

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,660
heck is that

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,340
so once you watch qriket you'll probably

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,140
have the same idea that I did or the

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,000
same thought that I did is uh why can't

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
they just play baseball seems a lot

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,739
easier

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,379
so guys my name is uh Amar lakhani

30
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,320
um I am a hacker by trade that's what I

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,899
do my job really is to find thread

32
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,719
actors find like what motivates them and

33
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,339
really find like the logic behind those

34
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,619
threats um it's my job to really kind of

35
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,000
understand the coding behind those

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,860
threats and then kind of work with

37
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,380
machine learning and systems to see if

38
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,119
we can protect against them so obviously

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm a I'm a hacker by trade and I'm a

40
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
ninja in trading I know it doesn't look

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,380
like it but I I do study Krav Maga

42
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,540
and they say always like introduce

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,740
yourself and tell them like an

44
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,720
interesting fact about yourself I

45
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,000
discovered during covet I'm a smoker

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,340
I know that's a weird thing to say uh

47
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,159
but um I love barbecue and I started

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,720
like getting I got a smoker and it was

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,460
pretty awesome

50
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,020
all right that was the only joke I have

51
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
and my little niece told me please do

52
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,360
not tell that joke uh but I have to so

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
uh I've been um I've been in the

54
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,020
security industry for a little bit and

55
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,880
like I said um

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
you know my main job is to to track

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,380
thread actors I was pretty surprised

58
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,640
when I when I started my current

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,259
position and we get a chance to work

60
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,659
with a lot of law enforcement and other

61
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,299
agencies that how organized some

62
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,340
organized crime is I know that sounds

63
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,140
kind of weird but like some organized

64
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,880
crime units they actually have like the

65
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,860
equivalent of account managers that have

66
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,160
to sell a certain quota of like spread

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,020
or crime as a service

68
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,459
um they even have recruiting events I've

69
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,080
seen like thread actors have recruiting

70
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,940
events and like actually like offer more

71
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,980
money to other attackers saying hey come

72
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,080
work for us and that makes attribution

73
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
really hard because you used to be able

74
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
to like look at like coding and stuff

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,459
and like attribute threat actors but

76
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,900
since they're all recruiting and moving

77
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,420
around everywhere uh it gets uh it gets

78
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,280
a little difficult but we always hear

79
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,099
about like how sophisticated attacks are

80
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,440
and how you know badass some of these

81
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,819
threat actor groups are I'm not sure if

82
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,440
I can say that on on video but I guess

83
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,959
that's right but uh um you know I've

84
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,879
learned something about the internet and

85
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,319
I don't know if you guys know this or

86
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,040
not but people lie on on the internet

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,980
yeah you know how he discovered this by

88
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,660
the way is uh online dating

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
so I don't know if you have ever used a

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,060
service like match or uh Harmony or even

91
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Tinder right but um people are not

92
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,860
always honest about their profile

93
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
pictures

94
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,099
right I mean I wish they could be honest

95
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,599
like me I mean my profile picture is

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,120
pretty honest I feel like I mean

97
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,060
I know I know I did cut my hair I

98
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,739
all right we all look better from the

99
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,140
side profile but you know uh that's

100
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,239
that's okay but the internet lies

101
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,459
sometimes on like kind of scaring us on

102
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,560
like what threats are out there and

103
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
really what we need to do about threats

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,640
and I kind of want to show you how easy

105
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,040
it is to do a thread and I have to be a

106
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,180
little careful here but I'm going to

107
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,860
call this the hello world of hacking

108
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,540
because what I'm going to do is I'm

109
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,040
going to basically do a reverse shell

110
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,540
has anyone you guys all know what a

111
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,599
Rochelle is I'm assuming right okay

112
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,220
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

113
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,340
do a really basic reverse shell I'm

114
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,620
going to take Adobe Acrobat read or the

115
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,879
install program

116
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
and I'm going to insert a reverse shell

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,500
into it and this is pretty much real

118
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,480
time right there's no uh you know

119
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,159
there's a copy and paste uh right here

120
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,080
but besides that I haven't sped this up

121
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,599
or anything uh everything is uh pretty

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,980
much real time and I've renamed this

123
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,099
program evil.exe yeah this is not 100

124
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,900
how you did in the real world first of

125
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,858
all you wouldn't have a private address

126
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,779
on here you do a couple of other things

127
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,720
on here but as I said this is really the

128
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,460
most basic way I can think of an attack

129
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,639
as well as I've called this evil.exe

130
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,740
right so you would think that everyone

131
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,900
would like detect this attack it's not

132
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,060
even a real Attack every AV is gonna you

133
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,759
know trigger against this and you would

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
hope that would be the case now what I'm

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
going to do is I'm going to upload this

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
to virus total now uh just in case if

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,139
anyone doesn't know what virus total is

138
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,620
it's a Google runs you know website kind

139
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,360
of like a Google run website that has

140
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,759
about 70 different security vendors on

141
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,040
here and it scans against these vendors

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,780
to see if they detect this as a problem

143
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,419
or not now this hash has never been seen

144
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,040
in the world it's not a zero day by any

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,139
means but it's a brand new attack that

146
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,820
hasn't been seen in the world before and

147
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,160
when I scan against this you'll see a

148
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,199
lot of red here red is a great thing

149
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,180
even though this attack hasn't been seen

150
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,100
before these vendors are kind of picking

151
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,479
up the logic maybe they're looking at

152
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
some other things there's uh so it's a

153
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,100
good thing now I actually am stopping

154
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,020
this video early because if I scroll

155
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,520
down there's going to be a lot of green

156
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,220
on here and green is not a good thing be

157
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,440
green means basically they they they saw

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
it as as clean now I don't want to call

159
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,580
out any mender because first of all guys

160
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,680
virus told by no means is a comparison

161
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
tool and you shouldn't really be using

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,979
it as a comparison tool but I do

163
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,900
recommend to people like try your own

164
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,120
attacks when I talk to clients I go what

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,500
is the last attack you saw they're like

166
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,820
oh I saw something like six months ago

167
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
cool let's see if who picks it up if it

168
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,680
doesn't get picked up that's a problem

169
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,680
like six months ago right so uh so I

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
always tell people like try these

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,560
attacks but it always kind of makes me

172
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
wonder when we talk about like AI Next

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,940
Generation all these like Advanced

174
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,919
attacks when we're still not picking up

175
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,259
the most simplest attacks that can be a

176
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,759
little scary and today that's really

177
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,020
what I'm going to talk to you about is

178
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,060
from a little bit of from our IR teams

179
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,940
on some of the most successful but at

180
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,979
the same time some of the basic attacks

181
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,840
that we see and

182
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,820
uh and maybe a few new things that uh

183
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,280
you know we're seeing as well

184
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,919
so why why do attackers I shouldn't say

185
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,539
hackers we should say hackers is a good

186
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,940
thing right why should why do attackers

187
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,560
attack right

188
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
um you know they asked Willie sudden I'm

189
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
sure this has been using a thousand

190
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
security conferences you know they ask

191
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,740
well he said why does he rob banks and

192
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,419
he's like well that's where the money's

193
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,100
at I'm actually going to show you

194
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,139
conversations I I get to do a lot of

195
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,660
ransomware negotiations it's sad like

196
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
everyone pays these days don't don't pay

197
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,699
if you don't have to but um I I do ask

198
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,280
these ransomware groups like hey why are

199
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,479
you doing what you do and they're like

200
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,940
first of all because everyone pays

201
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
second of all because it's so damn easy

202
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,319
right I'm going to show you how easy

203
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,120
some of this stuff is

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,100
um so most cyber crime and I know we got

205
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,840
the state actors we got like you know

206
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,240
cyber cyber War happening we we're in a

207
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,639
little awkward time but most threat

208
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,699
actors are financially motivated and uh

209
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,560
you know that's why I think we see a lot

210
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
of ransomware attacks a lot of phishing

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,039
attacks uh because they have these

212
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,080
significant immediate impacts of

213
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,780
businesses and these toolkits are very

214
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,759
very easy to come across it doesn't take

215
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,979
that much uh you know that much uh to

216
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,720
get to some of these toolkits that's why

217
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
we see ransomware attacks and a lot of

218
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,259
service tax phishing attacks

219
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,300
um impersonation attacks I want to talk

220
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,979
to you about uh something cool that I

221
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,620
started seeing uh uh in 2020 and really

222
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,599
even this year uh started seeing a lot

223
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,000
of this it's called ATM job potting has

224
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,620
anyone heard of that

225
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,539
a couple of people

226
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,099
um so it's run by groups like out of

227
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,440
North Korea called beagle boys or fuzzy

228
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,400
bear

229
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
and sync is part of it no just kidding

230
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,300
these sound like boy bands to me or

231
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,319
something

232
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
well so what what is ATM jackpotting

233
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
really it's where thieves install

234
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,099
malware on ATM machines and basically

235
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,380
the malware is designed to dispense huge

236
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,759
sums of cash

237
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,740
now I I saw that Breaking Bad episode

238
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,940
where they're spending all episodes

239
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,940
trying to get into the ATM machine right

240
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,280
the ATM machine to get into the cash box

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,660
is very difficult to get to a USB

242
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,240
Service Port is usually very very easy

243
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
um now I know I'm not the only one with

244
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,099
ATM machines in his garage or maybe I am

245
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,660
but uh

246
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,400
but I like messing around with ATM

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,780
machines it kind of makes me feel like

248
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,340
uh you know I'm I'm making something of

249
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,640
my life and and I imagine there's a lot

250
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,020
of money in there although most of my

251
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,880
money is Monopoly money

252
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
um I still get asked at like Target and

253
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Walmart why am I buying like like 30

254
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,799
boxes of Monopoly I was like I need the

255
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,919
money

256
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,380
now it's been around for a while but um

257
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,240
it really started uh mainstream in the

258
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,160
US around 2018. but I gotta tell you

259
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
around 2020 and even 2022 I've seen like

260
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
just a lot of large attacks around us

261
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,459
um basically what these Cash Crew school

262
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,899
will do is they'll go around like

263
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,399
different ATMs like around a city maybe

264
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,440
hundreds of ATMs are like they're like

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,019
okay at you know 435 we're gonna hit

266
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,779
this ATM and once they do it's a one and

267
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,980
done deal they've already set it up

268
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,720
beforehand you know they have special

269
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,060
software or code that they put in and

270
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,560
it's and you can't really recover from

271
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,240
it because soon as you know it's there

272
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,620
you're done they're gone they're not

273
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
coming back and this is just an example

274
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,399
this is kind of an older toolkit but uh

275
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
you can see it's being sold on the

276
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,180
darknet for about four thousand dollars

277
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,459
um and um there's a lot of hits out

278
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,080
there these kits actually come with

279
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,420
playbooks that tell you hey this is uh

280
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,920
the manufacturer of the ATM this is how

281
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
you can double check before you install

282
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,640
it this is how to get to the USB service

283
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,620
key service port

284
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,240
um a lot of them like sometimes they're

285
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,860
fully exposed and you don't even have to

286
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,839
like move the move the ATM machine at

287
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,760
all I have asked the ATM vendors was

288
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,959
like why they do this and they're like

289
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,880
hey you know what like we're servicing

290
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,380
these machines they're not like Tech

291
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,000
guys they're not like I.T Security Guys

292
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,980
we just need to update the machines this

293
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,260
is how we update them so you uh you know

294
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,940
you know we were dogging on them a few

295
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,680
years ago for running Windows XP on all

296
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,800
all uh ATM machines they've kind of

297
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,420
gotten away from that but this is how

298
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,860
they updated to make these things easier

299
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,620
but it makes the tax easier as well

300
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,540
um and as I said uh something really

301
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,279
sophisticated they'll come up with like

302
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,140
cables and stuff but honestly it's

303
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,680
really just about taking a USB stick

304
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,820
sometimes prepping it a little bit like

305
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,920
depending on what program you're buying

306
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
and then sticking in the ATM machine so

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,540
um not not too much and these like I

308
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,040
said these dark hits are available for

309
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,380
sale like all the time

310
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
when I first started off like as a as a

311
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,279
threat Hunter I used to have to go to

312
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,019
all these onion sites and go on the tour

313
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,580
Network and find like a lot of places

314
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,740
where to find these attacks they're all

315
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,420
on the clarinet now like they don't even

316
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
try and hide themselves you don't need

317
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,779
any more special software to get to

318
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,700
these sites yeah sometimes you do need

319
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,440
like different logins or different

320
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,300
logins or different uh you know parts of

321
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,920
forums and they're actually even moving

322
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,300
away from that in fact this year I'm

323
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,920
actually seeing more and more like uh

324
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,200
telegram groups and and um and what's

325
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,579
that private chat channels and stuff

326
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,800
where these guys hang out at and it

327
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
doesn't take much to get access to it

328
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
just a little bit of um I would say

329
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,680
patience and just perseverance and then

330
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,880
you're in these groups and you can just

331
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,100
monitor what they're doing and what are

332
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,839
they doing in these groups right well

333
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,160
first of all there's a lot of credit

334
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,600
cards in these groups you can buy pretty

335
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
much a credit card for for uh you know

336
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
about two dollars for two dollars to

337
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,360
five dollars full credit card they're

338
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,220
selling them you know in lots of like

339
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,200
hundreds uh dozens at least maybe

340
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,000
hundreds sometimes thousands

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,519
um people's identity medical records

342
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,019
um I always think like why would someone

343
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,640
want to buy a medical record like if I'm

344
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,079
if I'm not famous you're not going to

345
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,459
really bribe me with a medical record

346
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,260
and I asked some of these groups like

347
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,579
hey what's the value on the medical

348
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,500
records and they're like think about it

349
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,760
they're like a medical record has

350
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,500
everything I need for your identity it

351
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,540
has your social security number has your

352
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,220
name has everything I don't need to

353
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,660
steal a credit card I can get my own

354
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,420
loan by stealing your identity and then

355
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,519
also I didn't realize how much of a big

356
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,019
deal or how much money there is in

357
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,459
medical fraud and just running Insurance

358
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,440
scams and things like that and there's

359
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,540
there's also kits that walk you through

360
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,720
the entire process on how to do that

361
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,459
now if you don't have money to buy these

362
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,140
kits from the internet uh you can you

363
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,459
can you can just buy money from the

364
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,279
internet that's that's fun too uh

365
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,260
so uh and some of this some of this

366
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,540
money is actually pretty uh now this is

367
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,160
this is older in fact this this

368
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,720
particular website is probably a scam

369
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,579
website but there are sites out there

370
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,620
that do sell counterfeit money and some

371
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,240
of them do actually pass that black

372
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,339
marker test to see if it's uh you know

373
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,959
counterfeit money or not some of them

374
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,519
you can actually hold up to a light and

375
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,779
see a little thread like you would tell

376
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,459
people you know to check for counterfeit

377
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,920
money so it's um it's pretty crazy like

378
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,540
I said what's out there or not

379
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,399
um as I said you can get someone's name

380
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,920
address full credit card number you know

381
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
the little verification code in the back

382
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,579
a stripe clone

383
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,380
um a full clone bypass but most people

384
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,639
are not actually going to be buying

385
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,079
stuff physically with these they usually

386
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,540
buy things online they normally look for

387
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,040
an address that no one's really

388
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,660
monitoring maybe maybe a house that

389
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,160
hasn't been built before and just pick

390
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
up the package or whatever that's that's

391
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
normally how they're buying things and

392
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,459
as I said this is outdated it's about a

393
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,380
dollar fifty per card right now that's

394
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,660
at least it was a couple of days ago and

395
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,339
has been around that price for a couple

396
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,899
of months

397
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,639
so how do attackers do this you're like

398
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,620
okay that's great but how do attackers

399
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,180
actually do this usually the first step

400
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,519
in an attack that I see is a phishing

401
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,920
attack Now by far I think finishing

402
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,200
attacks or some sort of email thread is

403
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,700
kind of the number one vector most

404
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,500
attackers go through and I'm going to

405
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,420
show you really how easy it is there's a

406
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,279
lot of toolkits out there that you can

407
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,600
just download in fact this one you can

408
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,579
get from GitHub

409
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,180
it's called the black eye um fishing kit

410
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,560
and there's there's like lots of them

411
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
available there's like pro versions and

412
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,000
different versions as well and uh you

413
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
can download this one I like this one

414
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,540
because it's it's kind of a fun one to

415
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,300
show and demos and stuff but um you can

416
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
see

417
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,440
that in this particular one I have a lot

418
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
of templates I can put in more templates

419
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
I can update templates I'm going to pick

420
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,019
in LinkedIn

421
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,940
because everyone likes to send all their

422
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,160
information to recruiters right like hey

423
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,139
I'm a recruiter and stop right there

424
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,000
here's all my info

425
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,399
take everything you want

426
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,620
so in this case uh this generates a

427
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,480
website for you uh this would be the

428
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,339
attackers machine yes you'd probably

429
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,839
customize that website make it look a

430
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,360
little more realistic but once I go to

431
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,560
that website

432
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,599
it pretty much looks like LinkedIn

433
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,320
I think most people would get fooled

434
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,820
especially if I have a little more

435
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,920
realistic website customize the actual

436
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
domain if I go to the real LinkedIn

437
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,339
website by the way you can tell it is

438
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,079
different it's like a light theme versus

439
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,760
a dark theme a little bit of a

440
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,320
difference most people are not going to

441
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
notice if I do care they notice I can

442
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,740
update I can update this easily

443
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,899
now notice when I go to the fake one

444
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,120
it also has a little lock box that's

445
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,740
what we tell our users right look for

446
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,360
that green lock box and that way you're

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,399
safe this actually generated a

448
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,019
certificate on the fly a less encrypted

449
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,540
certificate so you have that lock box so

450
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,160
you could all feel safe now putting in

451
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,519
this password

452
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,779
so I actually did this to a co-worker of

453
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,360
mine This is actually a live attack he

454
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,380
didn't know about it and then I told him

455
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,660
I'm gonna use him in every presentation

456
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,040
and uh

457
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600
he's like great

458
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,940
um it's uh my co-worker's name is Jonas

459
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,560
and so you can see he's from Singapore

460
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,440
uh I see some IP information I see his

461
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,899
username password and see some other uh

462
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,180
information as well now like I said

463
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,680
phishing attacks happen all the time and

464
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,560
it's funny how they they uh you know are

465
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,779
so good at like uh looking at what

466
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,820
motivates us sometimes I feel like I get

467
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,440
more news out of like watching the

468
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,240
latest phishing attacks right I go oh

469
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,860
you know what they're they're uh there

470
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,660
must be uh you know something happening

471
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,459
in uh Iran right now because I see all

472
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,019
these fishing attacks around that or

473
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,120
around elections or vaccines they're

474
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,100
gonna pick whatever they think is like

475
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,839
gonna motivate you to click on something

476
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,540
right like uh hey uh Thundercats are

477
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,800

478
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,779
yeah let me click on that I love Thunder

479
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,839
cast right and uh so whatever this could

480
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,459
motivate you they're gonna have a

481
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,620
phishing attack on that and don't think

482
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,240
fishing attacks are just limited to

483
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,279
emails they're getting creative now such

484
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,139
as of course mobile devices and mobile

485
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,000
applications as well

486
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,100
and starting to see phishing attacks on

487
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,720
Smart speakers like your Google and

488
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,060
Amazon devices so how does that work

489
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,220
right well a smart speaker basically

490
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,680
uses a skill that's an app on a smart

491
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,959
speaker basically it has a skill So when

492
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,600
you say hey there's no Alexis in here so

493
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
hey Alexa

494
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,899
um tell me uh tell me what the weather

495
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,519
is tonight so it looks in this database

496
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,440
it says okay I have an app or a scope

497
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
called weather and it's gonna you know

498
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,639
tell you the weather right well people

499
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,920
are registering skills that are they can

500
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,079
use for phishing for example if American

501
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,660
Express has an app or a skill that you

502
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,699
say hey American Express tell me my

503
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,680
balance it's going to be smart enough to

504
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,940
know hey I'm not going to tell you a

505
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,380
balance out loud here's a secure link

506
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,199
and go check your balance now what about

507
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,959
if someone registers or sees Amex is not

508
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,920
taken and you say hey Alexa what is my

509
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
AmEx balance it could say something like

510
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,579
you're a counseling hacked here's a link

511
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,680
please look at this right away

512
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't know if you can hear that

513
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,919
now that that issue has been fixed for

514
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,020
AMEX but in this particular case it

515
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,939
actually sent a secure link depending on

516
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,380
what device you were receiving it on

517
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,240
what device was registered to your LX

518
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,939
account if it was iOS or Android or even

519
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,400
a desktop machine it would give you the

520
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,640
proper attack so the most capable attack

521
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,380
it wanted

522
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,799
like I said once users get on systems

523
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,360
um they do a whole bunch of stuff they

524
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,919
usually will extra you know take out

525
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
data explore data data um they'll kind

526
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,700
of mess around they'll land and expand

527
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,559
but usually normally the last step I

528
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,299
always get asked about ransomware and I

529
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,620
hate it when someone tells me like

530
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,360
especially a customer tells me hey I

531
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,880
gotta ransomware because my thought is a

532
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,140
lot of other things happen they're

533
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,280
probably a lot worse before you got

534
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,500
around somewhere I normally find them

535
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,080
most attackers they'll um execute the

536
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
ransomware when they feel like they have

537
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,860
nothing else of value from you they're

538
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,299
like I've gotten everything I want from

539
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,980
you or or if they feel like they're

540
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,179
about to get caught like if you start

541
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,860
doing some sort of Investigation or

542
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,360
incidental response and like man I got

543
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
caught let me execute the ransomware

544
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
now I'm finding a lot of people these

545
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,000
days and I don't know why the trend is

546
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,740
changing but I find a lot of people are

547
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,440
like starting to pay for ransomware and

548
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,760
um here's an example this is a real life

549
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,860
example of this I did actually take off

550
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,240
some screenshots and change some things

551
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,740
around just so we can identify the

552
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,440
client that easily but this is a ransom

553
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,580
note that

554
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,500
um that someone got it says please pay

555
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,179
lots of Bitcoins after they got attacked

556
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,740
this was a hospital it was a healthcare

557
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,320
provider and basically they went on this

558
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,600
darknet channel and they said hey uh we

559
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,580
got hit by ransomware uh we want to pay

560
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
uh what What's the deal and basically

561
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,620
the threat actor said pay us 10 million

562
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,880
dollars

563
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,919
wow 10 million dollars and they're like

564
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,539
wait the note said we would get a

565
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,020
special price if we contacted you early

566
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,160
wow I can't I can't believe they're like

567
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,539
asking about a special price they're

568
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,039
like

569
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,660
what's on the dollar menu guys

570
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,520
uh so uh they're like guys this isn't

571
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
special price because if you think about

572
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,179
the lawsuits your reputation all this

573
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,340
other stuff you know it's gonna it's

574
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,140
gonna probably cost you more then this

575
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,640
is where the negotiations happened I had

576
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,780
to take a couple of things off because

577
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,520
they were identifying themselves pretty

578
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,620
pretty easily but essentially they

579
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,299
settled on four million dollars they

580
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,460
said hey we will pay you four million

581
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,020
dollars if we can get our get our data

582
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,940
back now can you really trust these guys

583
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,039
the sad answer is yes you can trust him

584
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,960
because they never want you to hesitate

585
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
they don't want you to go on a forum and

586
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
tell people you know what I paid these

587
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,940
guys and I didn't get my data back they

588
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,200
want you to go on for them say I pay

589
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,580
these guys and I got my data back so

590
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,500
when the next guy gets attacked they

591
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,600
have no hesitation so they ended up

592
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,340
paying these guys and you can even see

593
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,620
they even told them guys these are all

594
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,120
the things you need to fix by the way

595
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
this is all the things you did wrong

596
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,160
I've actually seen threat actors or

597
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,600
these ransomware groups give reports

598
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,820
like PDF reports and HTML reports that

599
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,440
look better than pen testing companies

600
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,120
that you pay thousands and thousands of

601
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,799
dollars for these are like awesome

602
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,299
awesome reports and they give you like

603
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,860
samples and exactly everything what to

604
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,760
do

605
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,620
now the sad part was this was open on

606
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,140
the internet and just like I found this

607
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,419
anyone can find this including other

608
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,120
thread actors so you know like even

609
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,440
though these guys are probably not going

610
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
to hack this company again or attack

611
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,860
them other people can go back and go

612
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,120
like I bet you they haven't fixed

613
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,620
everything I'm gonna just attack them

614
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,179
again and you know what maybe they won't

615
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,380
pay four million dollars but I bet you

616
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,520
they won't even think twice a bit about

617
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,260
paying a hundred thousand I can do the

618
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,419
exact same thing again

619
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,760
now you can see they they actually left

620
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,080
the lines of communication open they're

621
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,820
like hey you need anything else we're

622
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,840
good

623
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,580
you pay me four million dollars you'll

624
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,600
get the best tech support

625
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,100
I'll come hang your TV like whatever you

626
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,639
want I'm off before

627
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,500
now how does this work the one thing

628
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,059
that I found like pretty interesting is

629
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,400
that most threats these days um they're

630
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,679
they're kind of run like in botnets like

631
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,240
when I first started off a botnet was

632
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,620
just like a program that used to attack

633
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,660
other machines it was like a dental

634
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,280
service attack it used to do a few other

635
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,320
things now these things botnets are

636
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,940
actually kind of changing maybe maybe we

637
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,020
need to update the definition or

638
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,880
something because these days botnets are

639
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,520
almost like me this is my term a CDN a

640
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
Content delivery Network where it just

641
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,660
is basically a loader that that is

642
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,760
staging for other types of attacks

643
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,419
so I'm going to show you a quick simple

644
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,940
example of a botnet that you can also

645
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,620
download on GitHub

646
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,440
you need to talk to Microsoft here right

647
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,240
so this is called build your own botnet

648
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
but I want to show you like how

649
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,480
sophisticated some of these uh some of

650
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,340
these uh tool kits look like and how

651
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,020
command and control look like this is

652
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,159
this is really how it looks like now

653
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,780
this is the free version of this tool

654
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,460
there is a paid version of this hole or

655
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,620
better tools out there as well

656
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,780
um so uh so we're gonna attack my friend

657
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,120
Jonas again

658
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,400
because you know he's in Singapore

659
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
so just don't please attack random

660
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,520
people from Singapore they'll they'll

661
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
come against me but uh in this case I

662
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,440
have like basically executables or a

663
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,600
python script in the paid version I can

664
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,980
actually do a lot more I can do a VBS

665
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,539
script I can do a VBS script in an

666
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,580
office document I can do Powershell I

667
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,140
can do a lot of other things but you

668
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,700
know this really was a demo so I just

669
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,260
kind of wanted to show you we go back on

670
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,440
the victims machine and uh the victim

671
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,240
has an executable you'd probably get it

672
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
for a phishing attack or something like

673
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,360
that like I said in real life this would

674
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,460
be an Office document I do have the

675
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,900
ability to actually change the icons to

676
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,280
make it look like Office document but I

677
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,140
would I would never run an exe

678
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,760
um in real life as an attack for this if

679
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,500
I was an attacker

680
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,299
um but uh but you can see once I run

681
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,760
this it normally bypasses all their

682
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,980
security perimeter security and

683
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,559
basically does a reversal back

684
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,419
once I get the reverse shell back I'll

685
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,419
refresh the screen and I see that uh

686
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,860
basically uh

687
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,600
Jonas is connected back to my control

688
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,700
command and control server I have full

689
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,980
shell access to a system I can do other

690
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,200
things I can install more software I can

691
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,900
escalate privileges I can do you know

692
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,780
turn on his webcam put on a key logger I

693
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,100
have a couple scripts that automatically

694
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,419
do that or will attempt to do that

695
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,419
automatically for me but uh at the very

696
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,919
end maybe I'll just install software and

697
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,260
give them some ransomware so a lot a lot

698
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,940
of different options that are that are

699
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,320
that are available

700
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,400
now I always ask myself like hey um

701
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,500
you know you know like why isn't this

702
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,480
stuff being like stopped like why is it

703
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,179
so hard to stop this stuff and um like I

704
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,679
said it's uh you know we don't have time

705
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,179
to talk about this could be like a

706
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,280
two-hour discussion but what I'm finding

707
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,960
is most of this stuff is like hard to

708
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,700
catch because for the most part

709
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,740
attackers are using systems that already

710
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,780
exist they're using like routers iot

711
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,520
devices they're not creating anything

712
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
new that used to be kind of the old

713
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
school way that I used to be like three

714
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,200
four years ago they used to like kind of

715
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,120
like create new attacks now these days

716
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,860
they're like hey let me try and steal

717
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,720
credentials through phishing attacks and

718
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,159
then once I steal your credentials I'm

719
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,720
gonna dump your ad and then I'm gonna

720
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,580
like get you know figure out where your

721
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,799
uh you know remote desktops are and then

722
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,240
just get on your systems and I'm gonna

723
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,620
use tools that are already in your

724
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,179
environment like Powershell and other

725
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,159
tools I'm gonna create an FTP server get

726
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,500
the data out uh you know upload data I'm

727
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,360
gonna try and not touch disk with any

728
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,460
new type of uh program so as soon as you

729
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,500
touch disk that's normally where AV

730
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,140
programs like turn off and or leak and

731
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,299
uh and so it makes it a lot easier for

732
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,440
them they have to think about it a

733
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
little more but it makes a lot easier

734
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,679
not to get caught because when I take

735
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,480
and this is just an example when I just

736
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,100
take a look at like top operating

737
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,559
systems that were compromised and you

738
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,480
can take a look at multiple lists you

739
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,740
see a lot of routers on their home

740
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,000
routers everyone's working from home

741
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
right you see a lot of iot devices you

742
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,600
see a lot of other devices because

743
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,280
people are just like figuring out hey

744
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,380
what operating system is vulnerable and

745
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,780
let me get on that and use the existing

746
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,000
land we call that in pen testing living

747
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,820
off the land sometimes but that's

748
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,919
essentially what it is now I'm going to

749
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,440
kind of skip a few slides here and just

750
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,059
because we're kind of getting short on

751
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,020
time

752
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,299
I just wanted to show you uh before

753
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,340
because I always used to wonder

754
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,960
um hey Amar you call yourself a threat

755
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,000
Hunter what the heck does that mean what

756
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,860
does a threat Hunter really do right I

757
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,539
just kind of wanted to show you like my

758
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,940
life as a thread Hunter what I do and of

759
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,039
course this would be automated uh in in

760
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,020
this example but I'm going to show you

761
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,059
basically ransomware this is this is

762
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,620
real ransomware that I've just changed a

763
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,700
little bit but normally you have your

764
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,500
ransomware you have Ransom code normally

765
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,419
embedded or it's a downloader or

766
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,980
something like that and then of course

767
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,140
I'm gonna have some files and my files

768
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,400
could be anything in this case they're

769
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,659
just like test files nothing really

770
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,340
important but of course I could have

771
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,340
pictures I could have office documents I

772
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,520
could have uh you know movies anything I

773
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
want in this case they're just like test

774
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,860
documents

775
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,120
but what I'm going to do here is I'm

776
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
going to run the ransomware and normally

777
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,960
when I run the ransomware I get a ransom

778
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,299
note Ransom node is the note that says

779
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,760
please pay lots and lots of Bitcoins

780
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,340
um I actually had to change this demo

781
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,200
because I had a real Bitcoin address in

782
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,460
there and people were sending Bitcoins

783
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,760
like don't do that don't set Bitcoins to

784
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,100
attackers uh so but uh so now I just

785
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,600
have the Shady address uh that won't

786
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,860
work if you try and sell send me

787
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,299
Bitcoins there

788
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,460
um so uh but sometimes it does some

789
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,900
fancier stuff it'll change the desktop

790
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,100
maybe it won't even make anything

791
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,080
available just a ransom note

792
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,460
um and then usually all your files are

793
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,720
encrypted you can't get to any of your

794
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,059
files anymore and usually wherever you

795
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,919
have files you usually see the ransom

796
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,779
note there too now what I'm going to do

797
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,620
is I'm going to actually put this

798
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,659
through the cuckoo sound box the cuckoo

799
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:10,980
sound box I mean there's a lot of

800
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,419
devices at fortnite we have the 40 sound

801
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,039
box as well but this is an open source

802
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,779
sandbox and what it does is it actually

803
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,220
tells me what the behavior of the file

804
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,039
is it tells me like the iocs of the file

805
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,080
the indicators of compromise basically

806
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,260
that's what is all the bad things I make

807
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,179
bad right it basically shows me hey this

808
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,559
is when the file was run all the way

809
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,080
down to the very bottom when notepad was

810
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,460
opened and they showed me the ransom

811
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,559
text if I go into a little more detail

812
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,360
it's going to show me hey these are all

813
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,740
the registry entries that were dropped

814
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,720
or changed or modified these are all the

815
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,520
network connections that happened all

816
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,400
these different iocs all the little bad

817
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
things

818
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
so as a thread Hunter one of the things

819
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
that I do is I try and separate these

820
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,539
out and I put them in a database so I'm

821
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,039
going to put them in a database in this

822
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,900
case I'm using the misp database but you

823
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,880
can really use any database you want and

824
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
I'm just going to store all these

825
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,000
individual iocs in the database I'm

826
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,320
storing them putting them in an event

827
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,140
called 1406 just so I can reference them

828
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,360
later then I'm going to start examining

829
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,919
some of these iocs and see how they

830
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,480
relate to another so I'm going to use

831
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,460
this other tool called maltego Has

832
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,900
anyone used Montego

833
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,880
few people yeah I love maltigo it's one

834
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
of my favorite tools mostly just because

835
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,600
how it displays information so I'm going

836
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,820
to tell them altigo look at event 1406

837
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,100
now I'm not discovering anything new at

838
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,419
this point I'm not doing and I'm not

839
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,679
really doing any threat hunting at this

840
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
point I'm just telling maltego show me

841
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,940
what cuckoo found out about but I just

842
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,980
want to look at it in a different in a

843
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,779
little different way and uh mostly just

844
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,640
because it just shows it to me in a way

845
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,440
that I can kind of manipulate a little

846
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,659
more so let's go ahead and run the set

847
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,179
here and we'll go ahead and see what

848
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,460
mouth higo tells me and it's basically

849
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,260
going to come back and say wow these are

850
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,880
all the iocs in your database you know

851
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,919
including the IP addresses that were

852
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,600
connected to if I had the Bitcoin

853
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,860
address it was readable it would pull

854
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,720
that out the Bitcoin addresses it pull

855
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,700
out all these other things so like great

856
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,880
I've just have another report so what

857
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,740
else can I do here right and normally

858
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,179
what I do and like I said this is from

859
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,740
usually in this case would be automated

860
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,480
but I'm gonna say what else is related

861
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,400
do I have anything in my database that's

862
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,440
related to these events do I have like

863
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,240
any other events or attacks that happen

864
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,799
that have the same IP addresses maybe

865
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,779
the same Bitcoin addresses other things

866
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,059
of that nature and that's where I get my

867
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,159
start is figuring out like who did the

868
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,779
attack where did it come from maybe

869
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,640
start tracing a little more and then

870
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,140
it's just a whole bunch of detectable or

871
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,940
detective work and really just following

872
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,620
the patterns to see where you can find

873
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,779
the earliest pattern and like what was

874
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,120
the group who started talking about that

875
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,640
group first hey you know are they uh you

876
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,020
know was it like Finn six or did someone

877
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,340
call it Finn Aid at this point because

878
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,320
they they uh found out something new

879
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
about this group and when did that

880
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,500
happen and just examining a lot of that

881
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,900
stuff so in essential that's what thread

882
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,159
hunting is and that's what you do as a

883
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,419
threat Hunter

884
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,080
um

885
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,840
plus a lot more stuff like uh uh my boss

886
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,220
is here so I just don't want them to

887
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,200
think that's all I do

888
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,000
I do lots of other important stuff too

889
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,039
so I'll just uh and with one last thing

890
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,779
since I got one minute left is I'll just

891
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,299
say you know in cyber security it's it's

892
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,860
really about understanding where your

893
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,940
weak points are and where your

894
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,039
visibility is and I like the story from

895
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,659
World War II because it's a it's a good

896
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,700
story during World War II the British

897
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,860
British Air Force was being decimated by

898
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,440
by anti-german gunfire

899
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
and someone said you know what we got to

900
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,220
protect our planes we have to protect

901
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,720
our Air Force so they're like you know

902
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,220
what let's put a lot of armor around

903
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,720
this like our planes will protect them

904
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
right we'll just heavily fortify them

905
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,140
and that's kind of what we sometimes do

906
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,940
in cyber security we're like let's just

907
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,399
buy a whole bunch of stuff and hope it

908
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,500
works but that's not how it works in

909
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,940
real life and I do and you know someone

910
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,100
said like guys we can't just do this on

911
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,360
our plans because the planes won't fly

912
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,860
they'll be too heavy they won't be

913
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,720
maneuverable so of course they said you

914
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,580
know what let's let's be strategic about

915
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,020
it let's actually look at where the weak

916
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,120
spots are and where are the weak spots

917
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,860
well they're like well where are all the

918
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,360
bullet holes those are where those weak

919
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,919
spots are so that's where they're

920
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,720
getting shot at and they're like that

921
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
makes sense and when we sing about cyber

922
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,320
security we're like where am I failing

923
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,940
my users are failing phishing attacks

924
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,399
let me like invest in that uh you know

925
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm feeling compliance with me in less

926
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,120
than that it sounds great but but I like

927
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,620
the same because uh you know there was a

928
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,000
there was a uh you know a famous

929
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,679
mathematician and he's got he said guys

930
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,600
you're looking at all the planes that

931
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,980
made it back

932
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,419
what happened to the planes I didn't

933
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,399
make it back what happened to the planes

934
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,480
where you can't actually count the

935
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,399
bullet holes where were those weak spots

936
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,080
and that's what we have to look at right

937
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,880
we have to figure out where are the real

938
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
weak spots what are the problems that we

939
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,059
don't know about

940
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,620
um the way I figured that out personally

941
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,539
is I try and do a lot of trading there's

942
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,279
a lot of stuff available

943
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,659
um and this is all free everything that

944
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm showing you is like free like

945
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,020
training.40.com I love to hack the box

946
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,000
if you do hack the box for like six

947
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
months right you'll be a better pen

948
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,740
tester than probably like uh you know uh

949
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,580
15.4 percent of the people I know

950
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,899
so no actually it would be really good

951
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,340
it's it's really like some of the stuff

952
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,020
is really difficult and really hard uh

953
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,700
it's free you if you pay for the paid

954
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,380
version like I have no affiliation with

955
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,600
this you you get access to older boxes

956
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,640
people have solved right uh we have a

957
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,539
ton of training available on

958
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,580
training.49.com I actually have my mom

959
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,500
go through like a level one and she's

960
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,020
like I get it I and she's like yeah you

961
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,279
like I go what do you mean she's like

962
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,260

963
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,520
you're not a doctor I finally get it I

964
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,260

afterwards and thank you appreciate your

969
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,730
time
