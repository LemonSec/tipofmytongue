1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
by way of introduction my name is Josh

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,100
Broadbent I am the RVP for Solutions

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,420
engineering at Beyond trust software

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,980
specifically our public sector group

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,740
I have been doing I.T in some form or

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,460
fashion for 25 years now I started in

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,100
MSP when I was 12. I did National

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,619
competitions and National certifications

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,980
when I was like 14 which was a record of

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
some kind at the time I guess and I

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
transitioned that career into doing

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,059
architecture and design for networks in

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,340
public sector

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,640
K-12 and Department of Defense so that's

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
a little bit about me on a technical

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,920
level I don't have the picture slides on

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,020
a personal level

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,020
I am married I have four kids or as I

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,760
like to tell anybody when I travel I

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,480
have one kid in three spares so if you

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,579
are here and you would like to take an

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,500
extra child I am more than happy to give

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,660
them away no I'm just kidding

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,440
um

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,260
no seriously I love my kids they are I

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,240
have four of them the oldest is 12 the

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,159
youngest is four and the youngest is the

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,200
only girl in the group

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,939
um so she has definitely figured out

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,280
that she's the boss of the house

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,680
um so that that works out really well

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,040
uh in our spare time we wakeboard uh my

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,140
middle two kids play or my my yeah we

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,460
wakeboard the youngest one doesn't play

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,960
sports yet the middle two kids do soccer

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,780
and baseball and my oldest son is a

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,479
spelling bee athlete I don't know

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,520
whatever you would call that but he

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,820
competes he he's competed since he was

40
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,900
in third grade he's ninth grade now

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,240
spelling bees never lost a regional

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,000
Place third last year in state and this

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,799
is his last year to try to make it to

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,360
National so hopefully he'll he'll do his

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,400
thing he didn't get spelling for me I'm

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
glad they invented word check

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,020
so all right tell you guys a little bit

48
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,399
about Beyond Trust

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,799
a couple of things real quick

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,880
um this is a really fascinating

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
conference for us to be at and one of

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,600
the reasons it's fascinating is because

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,220
it brings together so many different

54
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,920
sections of cyber security and Security

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,220
in general seeing lock picking and safe

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,538
tracking and all of the other things

57
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,120
Hardware cracking downstairs uh is

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,980
really fascinating to me

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,160
because security does encompass so much

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,860
more than just software

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,599
um at Beyond trust we are a software

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,300
company we specifically Focus uh mostly

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,800
around the

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,680
um privileged identity space we want to

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,780
take care of privileged accounts we do

66
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,080
have 1250 employees and uh 18 different

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,700
countries one of the things that I like

68
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,860
to call out about these slides that's

69
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,540
important to me is that we have 75

70
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,780
different patents in the Pam space which

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,040
is really unique especially when you

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,900
realize that they go all the way back to

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,840
like the mid 90s so we inherited some IP

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,200
in one of our Acquisitions that's around

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,060
the way that you manage

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,360
uh privilege access in Linux so it's a

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,060
it's a policy form for for pseudo and

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,280
stuff like that so

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,860
um before other companies even had a

80
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,940
thought about privilege access

81
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,099
management and what that looked like we

82
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,319
had patents in the area so that's one of

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,159
the things that I always find

84
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,800
interesting about that

85
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,140
so

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,239
I like the slide to set the stage for

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,879
just a second about

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,220
where we are from a current events

89
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,300
perspective

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,640
and the funny thing about doing these

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
kinds of slides to me is

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,819
you put together this slide

93
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,220
or in my case my marketing team puts

94
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,140
together this slide for me

95
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,260
and I get to deliver it in two weeks and

96
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,120
it's usually outdated by the time I

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,519
could deliver it like we could add 15

98
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,860
more up here by the time that I deliver

99
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,379
the conversation and it's one of those

100
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,319
things that

101
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,239
exploits or hacks or breaches or

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,819
ransomware attacks whatever you want to

103
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,238
call them

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,700
they happen exponentially more every day

105
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,280
and it's almost to the point where they

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,980
make the news but

107
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,700
were desensitized to it in some way

108
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,120
we had breaches over the past 18 months

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,279
that compromised water facilities and

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,798
hospitals and gas pipelines

111
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,298
and

112
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,940
those things barely made a blip on our

113
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,500
radar

114
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
did you get anybody in here watch Tiger

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,259
King

116
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,720
like right at the beginning of covid I

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
got one guy all right

118
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,199
nobody else was that bored during the

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,000
first part of lockdown like it was a

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,139
train wreck that I couldn't look away

121
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,520
from

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,500
um it really was it was the weirdest

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,840
show I have ever watched

124
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,000
in my life and will probably stay that

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
way hopefully because I don't ever want

126
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,160
to watch anything that insane again

127
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,020
but I remember a couple of months after

128
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,320
it came out and I'd watched it

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,840
I saw a meme that was like this show was

130
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,060
so strange that this happened in the

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,479
show and you never saw it and it was a

132
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,060
picture of one of the main characters

133
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040
um driving a spider which is like a type

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
of motorcycle with two wheels on the

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,180
front and one wheel in the back and he

136
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,300
had a skeleton in the passenger seat

137
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,180
and it's like this clip happened in the

138
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,160
show and you never noticed that this

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
dude was driving around with the

140
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,460
skeleton in his motorcycle the entire

141
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,479
time

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,340
and they were right

143
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,020
like I went back and watched the episode

144
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
just to be like that skeleton was never

145
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,139
there

146
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,360
sure enough in this show this dude

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
driving around with a skeleton as his

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,360
passenger

149
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,220
okay it was funnier in my head

150
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,199
um but anyways the reason that I bring

151
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,860
it up is because breaches are a lot like

152
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,440
that like they are so wild and out of

153
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,720
hand today that

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,820
the dude driving around with the

155
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,160
skeleton doesn't even make the news it's

156
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,900
like living in Florida the strange

157
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,580
things happen and they just don't make

158
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,000
the news

159
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,940
but what It ultimately results in is

160
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,560
that we have to have a different model

161
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,380
for how we handle cyber security

162
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,460
especially from an Enterprise

163
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,840
perspective

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,479
from an Enterprise perspective

165
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,240
we have for 30 plus years as long as

166
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,220
I've been doing this looked at our

167
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,620
Enterprise security as a traditional

168
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,139
moat and Castle type infrastructure

169
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,360
right so we've looked at it as as long

170
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,919
as we build a wall around everything

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,419
that we have and we make sure that that

172
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,979
wall is robust enough and there are

173
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,020
enough things on the wall maybe we put a

174
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,900
moat around the wall

175
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,460
anything inside the wall is

176
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,220
automatically okay like we're all right

177
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,919
we trust our users which is a terrible

178
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,860
plan but we trust our users

179
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,460
um

180
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,380
everything that happens here

181
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,940
we're going to be okay with from a

182
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,259
security perspective it's an acceptable

183
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,479
level of risk

184
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,100
over time we've realized a few things

185
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
number one once somebody breaches that

186
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,639
wall we have no long no idea how long

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,440
they're in there

188
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,780
which is what happened with the

189
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,340
solarwinds breach

190
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,900
they were in there for six plus months

191
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,000
and we're still cleaning up

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,620
but beyond that

193
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,080
nobody anticipated the massive ships

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,180
shift to work from home

195
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,220
so now every admin assistant's kids Xbox

196
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,960
is on our corporate networks their Wii

197
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
is on our corporate Network so

198
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
we can't build a wall big enough for all

199
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,979
of these devices to fit inside our

200
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,000
corporate Network

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,319
there's no way

202
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,699
everybody that's here I'm sure has has

203
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,160
seen or been familiar with

204
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,860
um security conferences like this one

205
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,440
and others where they sh you know have

206
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,940
the Wall of Shame up and they show you

207
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,199
text messages that are going in and out

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,940
from people's phones

209
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,060
from a corporate perspective you consume

210
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,800
or have that many devices on your

211
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,699
corporate VPN at some point you you

212
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,099
can't do anything else it's it's there

213
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,680
and you have to give them free reign but

214
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,900
you don't and that's why we've looked at

215
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,120
zero trust as a model that's why it's

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,099
made a lot of headlines that's why it's

217
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,139
it's been a conversation

218
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,199
and the funny thing is 10 years ago zero

219
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,539
trust was a term that was mostly made up

220
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,060
by another Pam vendor so that they could

221
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,220
Splash it all over their marketing

222
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,400
um and then it slowly garnered

223
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,460
like a meaning of some kind and then

224
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,780
eventually somebody picked it up and

225
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,280
decided hey this should actually have a

226
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,900
standard to it

227
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,159
so nist came out with nist 800 207

228
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,140
and they put a standard behind it and

229
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,360
they said in this standard what we want

230
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,958
is a continuous verification of users

231
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,000
every time a user goes to access a

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,459
resource or authenticate we want them to

233
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,500
authenticate we want to know that they

234
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,540
have authorization to access the

235
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,880
material that they're accessing and we

236
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,860
want to audit all of that

237
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,959
and whatever tool that they're using to

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,980
do that we're going to put together

239
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,240
um we're gonna we're gonna collect that

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,740
data together so that we actually have

241
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,600
one single source of security data and

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,920
authentication data for our entire

243
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,180
network

244
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,220
and that's what's important when we talk

245
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,580
about zero trust is the collective use

246
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,279
and organization of tools a lot of tools

247
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,220
used to define zero trust or to to build

248
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,339
it in the architecture already exist in

249
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,320
corporate networks today the problem is

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
that they're siled right the problem is

251
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,500
that they all exist as individual tools

252
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,660
and not as part of a broader security

253
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,180
model that is integrated and

254
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,680
Incorporated together as a security

255
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,360
strategy

256
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
so the principles of the zero trust

257
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
model go like this so require and secure

258
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
requires secure and authenticated access

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,959
to all assets

260
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,580
adopt and enforce the least privileged

261
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,180
model

262
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,760
and inspect and log all activities using

263
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,839
security Analytics

264
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,080
as you're taking a look at implementing

265
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,820
a zero trust model across your

266
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,320
environment

267
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,060
there are several things that you have

268
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,880
to look at you have to understand what

269
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,380
your data looks like this is probably

270
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,500
one of the hardest things about xero

271
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,440
trust as it exists

272
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,380
data governance identity governance has

273
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,820
always been a challenge because we've

274
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,580
had so much unstructured data for so

275
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,880
long that we don't know how to tag it

276
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,399
and sometimes we don't even know what

277
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,220
the data is to know how to tag it

278
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,080
in addition to that

279
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,500
this requires cooperation from the end

280
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,779
user and from the business users and use

281
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:37,800
cases

282
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,600
understanding where sensitive data

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,940
exists getting them to stop storing

284
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,500
sensitive data in places that it

285
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,959
shouldn't go all of these things are

286
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,579
important in implementing a zero trust

287
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,140
model so that you can ensure proper

288
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,019
security is there

289
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,440
but it requires cooperation from

290
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,740
the end user or Enterprise to make sure

291
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,899
that you have that stuff tagged

292
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,160
correctly and it's one of the most

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,680
difficult things in the process

294
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,839
and then once we have that done we talk

295
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,880
about access to that data how are we

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,459
going to control access to that data

297
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,320
how are we going to understand roles or

298
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,540
needs or operations or attribute-based

299
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,940
access so that we can make sure that the

300
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,500
people who have access to that data are

301
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,700
the people that are supposed to have

302
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,620
access to it and that their access is

303
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,120
revoked when they are no longer supposed

304
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,140
to have access to it

305
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,959
we also have to monitor threats as we're

306
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,339
doing this we have to understand the

307
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,480
behavior that's happening on our network

308
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,120
is someone that's accessing this data

309
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,279
are they accessing are they accessing

310
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,779
the data outside of their normal

311
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,959
behavior analytics so they're used to

312
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
accessing this data you know at noon or

313
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,180
12 30 on a Thursday from their desk and

314
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,320
now level all of a sudden they're

315
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,700
accessing it at 2 A.M from a seat in

316
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,640
Nigeria over VPN

317
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
it's probably a problem

318
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,740
and we have to understand that

319
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,880
so we have to understand what those

320
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,019
threats look like and we have to

321
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,519
understand what a normal Baseline of

322
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,079
behavior is so we can understand what

323
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,060
abnormal behavior is and then we have to

324
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,500
be able to apply analytics to all of

325
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,220
that so that we can ensure that

326
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,180
so that we can ensure that we understand

327
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,459
the moments that we have a Potential

328
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,440
Threat we understand the moments that

329
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,800
something is abnormal and we can

330
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,880
investigate what those are

331
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,920
a successful zero trust implementation

332
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,779
requires privileged access management

333
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,779
for a few reasons number one you have to

334
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,860
secure

335
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,019
the privileged access and assets you

336
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,120
have on your network whether that is

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,740
your network admins that have access to

338
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,420
network devices whether that's active

339
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,800
directory admins whether that's your

340
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,920
file storage admins all of those use

341
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,320
cases have to be audited and logged in

342
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,860
order to make this strategy work

343
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,019
in addition to that we also need to

344
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,519
understand what our end users are doing

345
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,260
and we need to allow our end users to be

346
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,899
able to do their jobs and do it well

347
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,019
um

348
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,019
so

349
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,820
what we have to do is take the privilege

350
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,660
off of the end users and actually add it

351
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,279
through policy to the applications that

352
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,260
they're launching so that way they don't

353
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
have they don't have access if those

354
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,339
accounts get compromised and there's

355
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,440
lateral movement because the policy is

356
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,740
in place

357
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
so as we talk about

358
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,880
zero trust and what that looks like nist

359
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,560
800-207 outlines a successful

360
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,560
implementation for zero trust uh as an

361
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,200
architecture again it's not a product

362
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,300
that somebody buys you can't go buy zero

363
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,100
trust off of a shelf if somebody tries

364
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,720
to sell you zero trust off of a shelf I

365
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,300
would highly recommend you walk away

366
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,899
um but beyond trust can uh address

367
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,019
several of the 207 tenants through

368
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,660
various uses of our our tool and we've

369
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,480
listed some of those on these slides

370
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,260
we want to make sure that we are here as

371
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,420
we implement this to make sure that

372
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,040
everything is monitored everything is

373
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,839
measured that you can audit all of the

374
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,360
things that your end users are doing uh

375
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,980
from a privileged access perspective

376
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,680
that you can audit all of the privileged

377
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
access that they have on their servers

378
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,579
and network devices that we can monitor

379
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,260
and audit contractors that are coming in

380
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,240
remote users that are coming in to

381
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,620
understand that they're accessing the

382
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,260
assets that they're supposed to access

383
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,240
we want to make sure that just in time

384
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
privilege and least privilege is

385
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
enforced across a network

386
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
and these things are all important

387
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,000
because as we adjust to this kind of

388
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,579
passwordless concept we need to make

389
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,959
sure that

390
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,480
the assets that we're protecting that no

391
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,160
longer require passwords but require

392
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,839
some sort of other authentication

393
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,040
mechanism if they are ever compromised

394
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,600
uh if those authentication mechanisms

395
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,579
are ever compromised you're going to

396
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,820
struggle with lateral movement in those

397
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,699
because

398
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,260
once they have that authentication

399
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,880
method and they have that token say

400
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,079
they're going to be able to move

401
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,560
wherever they want to move so if that

402
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
account itself doesn't have privilege

403
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,279
but rather the applications have

404
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,139
privilege even if they move laterally

405
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,240
there's nothing for them to have access

406
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,100
to other than the standard user

407
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,240
permissions that anybody would have

408
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,300
so this is the zero trust diagram that

409
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,180
80207 put out where they kind of

410
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,839
outlined what a successful strategy from

411
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,820
an application standpoint would look

412
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,699
like we put our logos in there because

413
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,100
we think the Orange is pretty

414
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,500
um no I'm just kidding

415
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,180
no we put our logos in there in a couple

416
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,500
of spots

417
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
because we believe that these spots are

418
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,220
important and they're important from the

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,220
modules that we offer first of all we do

420
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,339
offer the policy Administration piece so

421
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,160
from a privileged access perspective you

422
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,959
can use Beyond trust to do

423
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,240
to manage the privilege the policy for

424
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,620
your privileged administrators for your

425
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,399
users all of that policy can be managed

426
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,959
in a central console so that you

427
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,339
understand what they're doing and what

428
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,079
they're supposed to be able to do and

429
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,500
then we have several places inside our

430
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,120
products that allow us to have

431
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,220
enforcement points whether that's on the

432
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,079
workstations that we're not trusting we

433
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,300
can continue to add privilege Management

434
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,680
on those like I talked about with the

435
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
just in time privilege and also as an

436
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,540
enforcement point on your administrators

437
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,500
and privileged accounts

438
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,399
this is our four pillar slide these are

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,779
the the pillars of products that we

440
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,079
offer that sit across the 800-207

441
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,600
deployment we look at traditional

442
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
privileged password management from a

443
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,500
um from a perspective of

444
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,020
password vaulting session management

445
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,240
being able to rotate those credentials

446
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,160
making sure that no one has access to

447
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,599
those credentials except when they need

448
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,859
it making sure that they get checked

449
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,540
back in rotating service account

450
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,480
credentials all of those things

451
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,459
the second pillar on the left over there

452
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,160
is the the secure remote access which

453
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,380
has come in as a strong conversation

454
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,760
Point as we talk about work from home

455
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,000
being able to have a way that you can do

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,160
remote access that doesn't require a VPN

457
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,039
that allows a connection

458
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,600
secured over an encrypted tunnel that

459
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,059
doesn't give broader sprawl access

460
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,860
across your network but allows

461
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,900
somebody's specific asset access to a

462
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,760
specific asset

463
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,440
um and then the just in time endpoint

464
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
privilege management that we talked

465
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,740
about whether it's Mac Linux Windows

466
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Windows servers uh we have something for

467
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,520
for those os's and then there is our

468
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,559
Cloud Security Management pillar where

469
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
we talk about Cloud entitlements and how

470
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,900
you're going to handle those

471
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,280
we are giving away a raffle so my shoes

472
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
are not near as bright as some of my

473
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,020
colleagues that have been walking around

474
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,679
um but we are giving away a 200 Noble

475
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,539
because it's no bull gift card to uh to

476
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,860
their to their store so that you can

477
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,240
order shoes if you want them to be as

478
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,679
bright orange as some of my colleagues

479
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,539
you're welcome to they're up on their

480
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,160
website though most of you would

481
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
probably choose a more muted color so

482
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,660
you can scan that QR code and register

483
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,820
for that the QR codes also at our table

484
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,980
downstairs

485
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,600
um and then we're at booth number 20

486
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,220
which is on the very end by the food

487
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,260
table which is where I like to be by the

488
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,760
food table

489
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,620
um and you can also check out our

490
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,200
trusted protector cartoon series uh and

491
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,780
then our Alice and Bob podcast is is a

492
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,700
great podcast with industry experts

493
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,380
talks about the human side of cyber

494
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,559
security and I promise it is not the the

495
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,960
podcast is not a uh a product pitch

496
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,820
constantly through I actually listen to

497
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,980
the podcast on my runs it's otherwise if

498
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,780
it was sales and marketing stuff I I

499
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,000
wouldn't so it's it's a great podcast

500
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,100
for The Human Side of cyber security we

501
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,480
interviewed some some really interesting

502
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,400
