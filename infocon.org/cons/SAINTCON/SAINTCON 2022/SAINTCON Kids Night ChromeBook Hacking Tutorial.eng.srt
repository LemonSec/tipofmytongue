1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,029
foreign

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,099
[Applause]

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,360
and we're going to teach you today how

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,920
to hack a Chromebook

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,599
Google and HP will tell you that the

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,280
Chromebook in front of you is end of

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,780
life and should be thrown away but we'll

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,400
show you how you can hack it and keep

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,740
using it

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,840
there are three parts to the process One

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,180
removing the right protect screw two

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,859
flashing the firmware and three

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,900
installing the OS

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,400
let's get started

15
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,420
hello and welcome to this quick video

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,280
tutorial on how to remove the right

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,660
protect screw on an HP Chromebook

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,379
um

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,100
Chromebook 14 G4

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,180
the tools you're going to need for this

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,980
is your favorite Precision screwdriver

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,320
set and then I'm using an automotive

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
trim removal tool you can get these very

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,340
cheaply at any hardware store or

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,160
anything that has a nice wide plastic

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,780
blade on it would work just fine as well

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,640
so it's pretty straightforward process

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,719
we're going to start with just the

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,060
visible screws here to begin with and

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,840
these come right out

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
make sure you hold on to these they're

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,200
all the same so you don't have to worry

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,240
about keeping track of which ones are

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,420
which

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,820
foreign

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,619
this one's always kind of hard to get

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,640
out there

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,520
it releases from the threads then it

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,960
doesn't want to come out of the device

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,119
to get that out I just use a little

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,000
magnet for my set here set it on there

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,659
it comes right up

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
if you don't have them I didn't use some

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,579
tweezers or whatever you got handy

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
foreign

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,759
visibles or screws are out

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,619
there's actually

48
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,399
five hidden ones here here here here and

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,700
here under little rubber plugs and best

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,960
way to get those out we're going to stop

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
in the top start in the top left corner

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,160
and just get a screwdriver with a

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,780
relatively small blade

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,819
pop in there at the bottom of the plug

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,040
and lift up and that is some adhesive on

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,480
these so you're gonna break an adhesive

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,760
Bond but there is also a very small nub

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,220
that fits into a hole right there and

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,379
then these are actually the left one

60
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,940
stays on the left so as you take these

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
off just put them straight forward and

62
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,319
then this exposes a screw onto each one

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
of these

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,819
you can see it is it kind of gets you

65
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,379
make a message he said but it still

66
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,060
holds pretty good afterwards if you

67
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,400
wanted to you put a dot of glue on there

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,540
if you were worried about it

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,899
sometimes these are a little tricky

70
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,519
okay got those plugs off

71
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,720
go back to your Phillips

72
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,819
oops

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,099
foreign

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,420
okay once all those screws are out

75
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,680
you're going to take the machine and

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,300
turn it upside down or right side up I

77
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,860
suppose

78
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,180
open the lid

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,239
now you'll see there's a silver and a

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,040
little kind of lighter silver on top and

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,599
then darker this is the seam right here

82
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,239
at the bottom so take your pry tool and

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,920
then I use my fingernail to make a tiny

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,420
little Gap and just get that edge in

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,400
there once you get an edge in there just

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
slide it across and not only in there

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,180
about a quarter of an inch or so I'm

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,620
going to slide it all the way across the

89
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,120
machine you can hear some pops as the

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,480
clips release

91
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,480
and then I'm just working my way up

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,939
gentle pressure

93
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,560
once you get one side done just go to

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,920
the other side

95
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,340
it's going to sound really scary but

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,940
it's not too bad

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,240
okay once those are released you can

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
grab the whole keyboard you can slide up

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
it now you don't have to unplug anything

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,979
all you have to do is just tilt this to

101
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,720
the side and open like that

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
and the screw you're looking for is

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
right here

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,440
screw right here this is the right

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,660
protect screw let's go ahead and

106
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,240
unscrew that

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,340
and pull it out

108
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720
and then go ahead and select the

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
keyboard right back down where it was

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
now the best way I found here is just

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,699
kind of lift it up a little bit and then

112
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,080
just pinch it between your thumb and

113
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
forefinger

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,500
and just snap that in

115
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,280
going all the way around

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,720
and then if you don't get it perfect

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,340
that's okay because when you put the

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,500
screws in it'll pull in the rest of the

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,560
way

120
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,419
okay

121
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,139
close the lid turn it over again and the

122
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,919
screws go back in

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,600
I like to start with the four corners

124
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,120
you'll hear it clip in a little bit as

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,220
the tension gets back on those screws

126
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,219
foreign

127
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,139
a few more here to do

128
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,660
you hear the clips engaging as we get

129
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,560
the tension back on those

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,039
foreign

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,479
take our plugs and remember they've got

132
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,979
this that one little

133
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,840
rubber peg in there I'm just going to

134
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,979
line that up and push those in

135
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,160
the center one is just adhesive based

136
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
but it always seems to stick in pretty

137
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,500
well okay you're done

138
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,780
and once you got those all in turn it

139
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,340
back over and you're ready to proceed to

140
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,419
the software section

141
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,440
let's Flash the firmware please remember

142
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,180
that you can pause the video at any time

143
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,319
to make sure that you have the steps

144
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,120
just right the screens we are showing

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,259
you are the screens that you should see

146
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,900
for an HP 14 G4 Chromebook if you're

147
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,340
using another type of Chromebook the

148
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,479
screens may vary a little bit

149
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,240
power on your Chromebook and allow it to

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,380
build a boot to the OS

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,660
click let's go

152
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
now that you're on Chrome OS you'll want

153
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,020
to connect it to a Wi-Fi network make

154
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,460
sure to pick a Wi-Fi network that has

155
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,940
good internet

156
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,000
how you will be required to accept the

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,080
Google terms of service

158
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,839
the Chromebook May sit a while and get

159
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,260
things ready

160
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,320
a new screen will come up make sure not

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,899
to log in instead click the button on

162
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,220
the bottom to browse as a guest

163
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,700
then immediately go to the lower right

164
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,040
hand side click the menu and click exit

165
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,180
guest

166
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,040
the first thing we will do is put the

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,959
Chromebook in boot recovery mode you can

168
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,339
do this by pressing and holding Escape

169
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,140
refresh and power at the same time

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,220
now that it's in recovery mode Let's

171
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,380
Tell it to go into developer mode you

172
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,880
can do that by pressing Ctrl d

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,440
a new screen should pop up looking

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,839
something like this press enter to turn

175
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,220
off OS verification

176
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,620
a new screen looking like this will pop

177
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,080
up wait about 30 seconds and don't press

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
any Keys the Chromebook will eventually

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,560
beep twice and then reboot

180
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,880
after it reboots the Chromebook will

181
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
display a message that it is

182
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
transitioning to developer mode it will

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,940
count down for 30 seconds don't press

184
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,720
any keys

185
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,240
this next screen will look similar but

186
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,980
you will notice a longer countdown in

187
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,959
the upper left corner this step can take

188
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,359
anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes be patient

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,700
when it's done it will reboot and it

190
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,560
will show a screen like this just wait a

191
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
little bit longer and eventually it will

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,980
boot into developer mode Chrome OS

193
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
now that you're in Chrome OS and

194
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,459
developer mode you'll want to connect it

195
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,680
to a Wi-Fi network make sure to pick a

196
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,240
Wi-Fi network that has good internet

197
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,579
school or work wi-fi may not work for

198
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,440
this as the sites we are using may be

199
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,860
blocked

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,339
now you will be required to accept the

201
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,420
Google terms of service

202
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,060
the Chromebook May sit a while and get

203
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,479
things ready

204
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,540
a new screen will come up make sure not

205
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,120
to log in instead click the button on

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,440
the bottom to browse as a guest

207
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,180
Now navigate to Mr chromebox.tech

208
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,560
scroll down on the left hand side and

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,540
click on firmware utility script

210
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,779
scroll down the page until you see the

211
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,220
first one line script block

212
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,220
now press and hold Ctrl alt t a new

213
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,740

215
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,120
select the script line and copy it to

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
the clipboard then paste it to the new

217
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,079
window you just opened you can also type

218
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,699
it when you are done press enter

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,360
the command will take a moment to run

220
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,160
and should eventually display a menu

221
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
select option 2 by entering the number

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
two and then pressing enter

223
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,980
when prompted you will press Y and then

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,880
enter to continue

225
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,260
if you get an error message like this

226
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,700
one it means that you didn't remove the

227
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,079
right protection screw or there's a

228
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,339
little bit of conductive debris

229
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,680
connecting the screw pad open up the

230
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
laptop and make sure the screw is

231
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
removed to make sure that there are no

232
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,740
debris around where the screw was an

233
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,600
adult can use a razor blade to clean off

234
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040
the circuit board if there's any debris

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,399
on it

236
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,540
select option 2 by entering the number 2

237
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,880
and then pressing enter

238
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,160
when prompted you will press Y and then

239
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,120
enter to continue

240
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,940
press y again to continue

241
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,880
it's going to ask you if you want to

242
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,380
create a backup of the old Chrome

243
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,660
firmware you can press n and hit enter

244
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,920
to skip that step

245
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,740
now it's loading the firmware this will

246
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,300
take a while be patient

247
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,019
eventually we'll come to a screen like

248
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,639
this showing that it's done with this

249
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,740
part of the firmware press enter to go

250
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,399
back to the menu

251
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,060
now we need to do the second part of the

252
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,040
firmware select option one by pressing

253
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
one and then press enter

254
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,899
just like before you are going to press

255
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,180
Y and then enter to continue you will

256
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,040
then press y again to confirm your

257
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,459
choice

258
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,360
again this step will take a while when

259
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,980
it is done you will press enter to

260
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,060
return to the main menu

261
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,300
now that we are done flashing the

262
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,579
firmware we need to reboot do that by

263
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,138
pressing R and hitting enter

264
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,120
look at that it's a bunny you did it the

265
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,699
firmware is now flashed

266
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,759
don't worry about the emmc error you see

267
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,380
we will show you in part three how to

268
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,000
use that to load the new OS

269
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:06,368

[Music]

274
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,580
system we've chosen to use Raspberry Pi

275
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,980
desktop but you can use any Debian based

276
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,299
operating system

277
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,160
now that you have the USB drive ready

278
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,900
let's go back to your Chromebook when

279
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,280
your Chromebook boots it will give you

280
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,720
that error message we saw at the end of

281
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,520
the firmware just press enter and it

282
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
will enter a shell prompt then type exit

283
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,900
and press enter

284
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,600
you should now be in BIOS select boot

285
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,340
menu and press enter if you have the

286
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,720
flash drive plugged in and it was

287
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,640
prepared properly you will see it in the

288
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,559
list the flash drive name will be

289
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,360
different based on the manufacturer of

290
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,500
the drive so it may look a little

291
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
different than what you see on our

292
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,799
screen

293
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,440
select your USB drive and press enter a

294
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,360
menu will come up select graphical

295
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,799
install and press enter

296
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,059
it will load for a minute and eventually

297
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,280
ask you for a language select your

298
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,840
language

299
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,760
Please be aware that you may have to

300
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,640
scroll up to find English

301
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,620
also sometimes the trackpad does not

302
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,660
work you may have to use the arrow keys

303
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,419
on the keyboard use tab to change what I

304
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,059
selected and enter to continue

305
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,220
it is going to start loading things this

306
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,720
may take some time depending on the

307
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,740
speed of your flash drive

308
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,940
eventually we'll start working on the

309
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,860
drive partitions we will need to make

310
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,720
some changes here to help increase the

311
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,559
life of the storage

312
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,740
select guided use entire disk

313
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,520
select the MMC SD card

314
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,740
then select all files in one partition

315
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,419
reporting system with

316
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,580
the lower the load

317
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,460
cliff and hopefully make it last longer

318
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,679
double-click on the swap partition and

319
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,299
then double click on delete the

320
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,660
partition

321
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,380
then click on the ext4 partition and

322
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,059
expand it to use the space that was

323
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,780
previously allocated to a swap make sure

324
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,280
that you read each of the prompts and

325
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,660
select yes you want to continue

326
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,340
otherwise you'll end up in a loop

327
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,559
sometimes it won't let you do this step

328
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,360
that's okay because you're only losing a

329
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,620
little bit of storage just continue

330
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,020
now that you have expanded the ext4

331
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,520
partition we are almost done

332
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,620
double-click finish partitioning and

333
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,740
write changes to disk

334
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,120
if you have a warning and say that you

335
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,100
did not configure a swap partition you

336
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,600
can safely ignore that message and

337
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,460
continue on and fully partition the

338
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,539
drive by selecting no

339
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,600
then select yes to partition the disk

340
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,860
that's it the install will now continue

341
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,960
by itself it can take about 20 minutes

342
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,000
we've included the entire install here

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,620
so you can watch and compare it to what

344
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,918
you're doing

345
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,880
anytime you run into trouble you can

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,620
just start this process over again and

347
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,960
reinstall the operating system

348
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
when it's done it will prompt you to

349
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,980
click continue and reboot make sure to

350
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,380
pull out the flash drive and reboot the

351
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,700
system

352
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,740
once a boots it will bring you into a

353
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,600
Raspberry Pi desktop it will walk you

354
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,100
through a short setup where you set a

355
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,659
username and a password and then it will

356
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,179
reboot and then you will be good to go

357
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
at that point you'll hacked your

358
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,659
Chromebook completely and now have a

359
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,460
full operating system on it that you can

360
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,159
continue to use

361
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,840
one thing you will need to remember to

362
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,700
do is connect it to Wi-Fi at home and

363
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,159
run any OS updates this will take some

364
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,600
time and you won't have time to do this

365
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,340
at kids night

366
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,679
Raspberry Pi OS will prompt you when

367
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,240
updates are ready to install

368
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,100
you can do so many things with this

369
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
Chromebook while you can use it to surf

370
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,760
the Internet and watch YouTube you can

371
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,320
also play Minecraft or learn more about

372
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,600
coding or even monitor airplanes as they

373
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,020
fly overhead the sky is the limit

374
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,060
