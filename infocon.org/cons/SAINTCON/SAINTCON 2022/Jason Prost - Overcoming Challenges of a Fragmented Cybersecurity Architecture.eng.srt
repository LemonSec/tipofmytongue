1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,360
for one minute in and I've got I've got

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,220
about a 90 minute presentation I'm going

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,359
to do in 25 minutes

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,139
hello everyone my name is Jason Prost I

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,420
am the head of growth Technologies at

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,760
checkpoint

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
my particular Department

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
is out so I don't get quite so much

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,039
sibilance

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,500
um my particular responsibility is

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,920
covering all of our Cloud security our

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
Workforce security and our overarching

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,180
platform security strategy with regards

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,140
to sales positioning discussing it with

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,860
customers Etc today I am going to talk

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,260
about cyber threat prevention

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,180
architecture how we modernize our uh how

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,719
to uh an approach to modernizing

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,600
um our cyber security environments our

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
cyber security architecture that's out

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
there I've been in the industry since

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,340
the late 90s I've come up with a lot of

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,640
of the things that the industry has has

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,939
worked on with the market and uh

25
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,500
hopefully today's perspective will give

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,460
you

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,260
um some fresh new ideas and thoughts

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,320
about how to approach cyber security

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to start with cyber threat

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
intelligence I had the opportunity to

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,320
meet with several federal agencies sit

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,740
on a round table with the CIA the FBI

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,280
Department of Homeland Security uh I and

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,700
a group of Partners sat on a round table

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,259
talking with the Cyber threat

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,439
intelligence groups around what they

37
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,780
were doing what the industry is doing

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,600
how we can improve Etc one of an

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,759
interesting pieces one of the

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
interesting takeaways that came from

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,520
that particular Roundtable discussion

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,720
there was a lot of conversation about

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,600
how to improve it there's been a lot of

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,540
progress that's made to really segment

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,880
and delineate threat intelligence around

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,640
four particular areas technical tactical

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,239
operational and strategic and it's

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,739
really cool the work that's been done in

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,599
cyber threat intelligence

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,319
um

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,599
but the conversation started to gear

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,099
started to to Veer off towards this and

53
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,480
we need to do the following things

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,959
because we've got to protect our uh our

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,640
environments we've got to improve cyber

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,860
threat intelligence because we've got we

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,660
have to do a better job of protecting

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,480
our environments and

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,300
um I interjected and I said you know I

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,879
I'd like to point out that I think that

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,099
cyber threat intelligence the progress

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,200
that's been made there and what we have

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,540
around cyber threat intelligence today

64
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,660
isn't where our problems are

65
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,060
um I think that our environments are

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,459
vulnerable and insecure I think the

67
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,780
approach that we take to our

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,379
architecture is where we have are prone

69
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,580
to attack and vulnerability susceptible

70
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,620
to compromise

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,959
despite a plethora of cyber threat

72
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,400
intelligence and interestingly

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,340
the the head of the CIA and the head of

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,040
FBI's threat intelligence groups they

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,500
started nodding their heads and shaking

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,980
vigorously around that because we got to

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,940
a place where we were talking about

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,620
protection

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,360
um when cyber threat intelligence is

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,700
about information

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,040
the other thing that's really cool and

82
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,920
and I brought this to Bear uh this is a

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,379
quote from the acting director for the

84
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,299
office of the president if anyone is

85
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,400
working with uh public sector especially

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,940
Federal you know that there is a a

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,920
driving movement

88
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,379
to modernize their cyber security

89
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,540
infrastructure and their cyber security

90
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,019
programs not a little one a massive

91
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,799
movement in fact for the first time

92
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,500
uh many in the industry recognize that

93
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,299
the federal government is moving faster

94
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,060
than private sector at adopting and

95
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,439
transforming their cyber security

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,079
programs and infrastructure and it's

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,820
because of a key one key particular area

98
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,019
and uh we're going to talk a little bit

99
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,400
about that and talk about how to

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,740
approach it from there

101
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,300
um but

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,380
this idea of modernizing uh our programs

103
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,840
through intelligent and vigorous use of

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,340
modern technology and security practices

105
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,139
I'm going to start with a very basic one

106
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,400
I want to start with one that's

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,660
extremely basic it's a pet peeve of mine

108
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,660
I sat on the partner side for most of my

109
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,060
career and now coming to checkpoint for

110
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,820
the last three years I've now sit on the

111
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,500
supplier side

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,820
um this is probably of all the things

113
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,639
that I would ask customers and I would

114
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,620
ask the market to think about

115
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,380
the biggest one is to make sure that the

116
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,240
systems aren't critically exposed I mean

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,759
what was solar wind solarwinds was the

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,100
fact that we had

119
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,639
a vital system that had exploits built

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,340
in it that was pervasive across all of

121
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,039
our infrastructure

122
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,680
here's four vendors four primary

123
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,020
security vendors big security vendors

124
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,699
out there and the critical

125
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,440
vulnerabilities in mean time to repair

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,720
over the last six years this data was

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,600
updated in November I regret to say that

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,580
several of those have increased in the

129
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,460
last six months with regards to the

130
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,860
number of critical vulnerabilities it is

131
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,199
unbelievably disheartening to learn

132
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,419
about vulnerabilities by the way I'm not

133
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,460
this isn't about besmirching a

134
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,680
particular supplier or particular vendor

135
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,660
or particular product that isn't the

136
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,380
issue the issue is that as a market the

137
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,180
number of rfps for instance that we

138
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,820
respond to on our end that ever ask

139
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,880
questions around this is zero

140
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,380
we're never we're never being asked

141
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,940
to provide efficacy around our software

142
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,860
and it just it

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,220
it sort of boggles me that

144
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,960
um

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,699
being a practitioner of cyber security

146
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,380
for 30 years

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,720
that we have a market and an industry

148
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,280
that doesn't spend a great deal of time

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,900
worrying about the security

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,479
infrastructure that we put into our

151
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,479
environments and how secure they are

152
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,919
that's all

153
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,780
I think that we can do a much better job

154
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,720
as as a vendor Community a partner

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,300
Community a market and demanding that

156
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,639
the code that we are putting inside of

157
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,340
our environments is secure

158
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,639
and is is has a track record of being

159
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,259
secure

160
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,780
but let's move on to the modernization

161
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,280
one because this one's just a practice

162
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,139
this is just modernizing your practice

163
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,120
updating your practice with something

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
that is pretty obvious we're now all

165
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,560
talking about supply chain we're now all

166
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,080
looking at supply chain attacks and how

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,259
to look at third-party uh suppliers and

168
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,699
how they are providing secure code

169
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:19,560
I want to talk about zero trust and I

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
want to talk about zero trust not zero

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,639
trust network access not a particular

172
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,800
product I'm talking about a

173
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,380
philosophical

174
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,680
architectural approach to security a way

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,139
to change the way we look at it

176
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,419
first and foremost zero trust and zero

177
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,639
trust architecture is built on seven

178
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,599
basic pillars the first one is around

179
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,580
resources and making sure that resources

180
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,620
are understood whether it be data

181
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,780
whether it be the application services

182
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,460
that you have

183
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,400
um the users Etc all of those are

184
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,039
considered resources the second one is

185
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,840
around communication and that's just

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
making sure that all communication

187
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,560
Protocols are being inspected looked at

188
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,479
and are being considered from a security

189
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,160
perspective

190
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,380
the third is around sessions making sure

191
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,120
that what you're not doing is trusting

192
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,639
that everything after authentication is

193
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,340
open and and allowed to pass but that

194
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,660
you're actually inspecting and

195
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,319
authenticating and authorizing sessions

196
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,020
the fourth one has to do with Dynamic

197
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,080
policy and this this is with regards to

198
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,199
making sure that policy is is

199
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,300
um following the rule of least privilege

200
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
so that as users are leveraging the

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
policies that exist within your program

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,260
uh and those controls that you have in

203
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,360
your pro in your program that the rule

204
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,159
of least privilege is actually affecting

205
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
those policies that it isn't because I'm

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
allowing everyone on this network

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,660
through that now everyone regardless of

208
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,519
what their role is can do what they need

209
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,640
to do

210
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
uh uh the fifth one has to do with

211
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,899
monitoring that's pretty straightforward

212
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,339
but it's making sure that you see

213
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,660
everything that's going on in your

214
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,600
environment uh sixth has to do with

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,820
authentication and authorization uh

216
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,080
making sure that there's a strong

217
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,360
foundation around authentication and

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,100
authorization

219
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,080
um and the last one is around automation

220
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
this has to do with continuous

221
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,200
Improvement making sure that the

222
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
environment is

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
um is iterating on itself and is

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,459
improving upon itself whether that is

225
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,800
through your program or that's through

226
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,740
some form of automation automation comes

227
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,260
from the way that you've implemented uh

228
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,959
your program and your architecture

229
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,940
usually when I talk to customers about

230
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,260
this and I was having a very large

231
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,300
Congress a very good conversation with a

232
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,940
large client down in Atlanta uh we

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,040
talked about this and they went boy if

234
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
we just had the budget to be able to do

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
this sure this would be great but budget

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,140
prevents us from going down this path

237
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,360
and what I said is I I talked to them

238
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,339
and I said look you know

239
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,380
there's a practical way to approach this

240
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,839
this is from Forester this sort of shows

241
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,980
the relationship between people devices

242
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,560
workloads networks the data and how you

243
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,620
sort of wrap around

244
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,019
visibility Automation orchestration and

245
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,240
Analysis

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,860
more importantly in the Forester report

247
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,360
where they talk about a practical

248
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,500
approach they show that there are they

249
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,180
show four or five key ways to progress

250
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,420
through that zero trust Journey

251
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,640
um the first being identity the second

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,980
around Workforce I've sort of adjusted

253
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,540
this to the way that

254
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,000
um I believe that it is effective but

255
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,920
everything starts on a basis of having a

256
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,839
strong identity program understanding

257
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,000
who the people are who your assets are

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,100
Etc being able to drive identification

259
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,860
is key but then you've got these four

260
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,200
others that progress closer and closer

261
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,360
towards the data this is not a unique

262
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,519
topic I was working on stuff like this

263
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,100
back in 1998. so there's nothing new

264
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,339
with regards to this really where the

265
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,100
newness comes is around the technologies

266
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,560
that sit in these three particular areas

267
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,320
and the capacity to drive a strong

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,180
identity program

269
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,399
I'm able to talk about the three there's

270
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
a lot of other uh there's a lot of other

271
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,279
people that are able to talk about

272
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,079
identity security identity security

273
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,420
programs and governance data security

274
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,220
data security and governance and the way

275
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,140
that those would be implemented and in

276
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,019
fact the utopian environment would be

277
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,180
one that eliminates two three and four

278
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,060
entirely and just has incredibly strong

279
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,220
authentication authorization and

280
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,399
controls on your data at your data based

281
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,200
off of identity and therefore it doesn't

282
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,300
matter what you're going through however

283
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,000
our environments don't live that way our

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,680
environments are 30 years old and

285
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,660
they're maturing and changing uh

286
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,240
dynamically and therefore we really need

287
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,220
to understand how we approach it from

288
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
these three other areas and there are

289
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
three areas that I happen to support

290
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,459
the first one has to do with Workforce

291
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,740
our Workforce environments have changed

292
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,240
dramatically over the last two years

293
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,480
three years very dramatically the shift

294
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,420
to work from home uh the adoption of

295
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
cloud has created a Workforce that needs

296
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,420
access to on-prem resources as well as

297
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,300
Cloud resources that has integrated in

298
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,339
with identity providers that are able to

299
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,040
provide authentication authorization and

300
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,200
controls

301
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,779
from that level additionally on top of

302
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,800
this

303
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,779
there's a whole set of controls that

304
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,160
need to be able to implement be

305
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
implemented that look for things like

306
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,940
anti-malware antivirus that look for a

307
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,760
secure remote access that the ztna is an

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,519
example that look at data access or look

309
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,940
at EDR xdr and build into the edrx Dr

310
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,760
framework that's there that drive into

311
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,579
applications and uh provide content

312
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,000
whitening Etc all of these things are

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,240
things that should be implemented based

314
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
on the user not based on device it's not

315
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,620
how the market asks for technology today

316
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,779
the market today typically asks for

317
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,540
Technology based on one of two things

318
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,339
that will say that they want

319
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,519
um they want to secure their laptops or

320
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
their workstations or they want to

321
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,420
secure their SAS applications and they

322
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,000
will differentiate between the manner in

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
which these are to be secured in a

324
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,620
modern architecture

325
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,920
all of these things should coexist and

326
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,260
shouldn't require that you as a market

327
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,839
or that the customers that are

328
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,620
Enterprises adopt integration uh

329
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,019
strategy for integrating and tying all

330
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,459
these things together

331
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,160
all of this should coexist in one

332
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,440
architecture so that the protections

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,420
that exist on your laptop are the exact

334
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,399
same protections that you have on your

335
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,260
mobile devices the exact same

336
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,880
protections that you have up in the

337
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,980
cloud on your SAS application be it

338
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,440
email or other collaboration tools like

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,560
teams or Google Chat

340
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,600
you want to extend the very same types

341
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,459
of controls the very same types of

342
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,860
Protections in all of them and not

343
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,200
compromise on either of them

344
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,779
when you do that what you're able to do

345
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,579
is you're able to drive very strong

346
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,459
orchestration and automation across all

347
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,820
of those different

348
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,040
the different facets of Workforce

349
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,959
security whether it be a laptop or a

350
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,839
mobile device you're able to have an

351
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,880
event that occurs on your laptop result

352
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,820
in very strict enforcement and control

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,519
on your mobile device and vice versa

354
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,620
you're able to have those coexist and

355
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,600
work together in a more orchestrated and

356
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
automated fashion when they are part of

357
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
the same program and the same

358
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,279
architectural requirements

359
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,100
on the cloud side interestingly zero

360
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,639
trust is probably the easiest place to

361
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,959
implement

362
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,899
um there's a lot of conflicting uh data

363
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,240
out there with regards to it however my

364
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,820
position is is that all of the

365
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,040
architecture is already in place inside

366
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,320
the cloud whether we're looking at uh

367
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
infrastructure whether we're looking at

368
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,800
workloads or we're looking at pipeline

369
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,320
what's very interesting is in a

370
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,959
multi-cloud environment we have tools

371
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
that are able to provide us with

372
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
visibility across that entire

373
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
multi-cloud environment we're able to

374
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,940
look at the posture of those third-party

375
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,040
environments and we're able to assess

376
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,320
that posture over time we're able to

377
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,959
drill down and isolate our containers

378
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,940
we're able to isolate our workloads into

379
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,980
containers into serverless functions

380
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,380
we're able to drive identity based

381
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,720
decisions all the way down through that

382
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
stack we're able to drive it at the

383
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,160
network and we're able to down merge all

384
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,139
the way out to the left into our

385
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,920
pipeline in the cic CD devsec upside and

386
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,959
we're able to drive identity-based

387
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,480
security measures there around

388
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,279
authorization and control the work

389
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,320
that's being done right now on that

390
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,959
shift left

391
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,360
devops side looking at the code that

392
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,420
under that uh builds those applications

393
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,220
the native applications that are in the

394
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,980
cloud is advancing at a rapid Pace

395
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,639
looking at the authors of the code and

396
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,860
the reliability of those authors looking

397
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,199
at the code base itself and how often

398
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,459
it's been updated and when it was

399
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,560
updated the domains it's coming from and

400
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,180
whether the domains have been hijacked

401
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,459
looking at the licenses of the code that

402
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,139
sits there and making sure that

403
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,240
organizations are protected from

404
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,399
licensed misuse and license injection

405
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,839
where it isn't just a log for Shell log

406
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
for J attack that's looking at actual

407
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,699
vulnerability in code but vulnerability

408
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,920
that exists in the license of that code

409
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,519
that exposes an Enterprise to

410
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,160
data access that you didn't expect

411
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,079
because you thought it was an MIT

412
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,019
license but the organization actually

413
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,699
implemented a different license under

414
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,320
the sheets that you didn't actually

415
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,720
inspect and look at all of that type of

416
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,240
stuff is happening in the pipeline today

417
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,780
and driving an ability uh enabling

418
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,839
organizations to drive a very automated

419
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,119
and orchestrated Cloud environment a

420
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,579
very rich security architecture on the

421
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,000
cloud side that is tied to identities

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,040
and tied to access control through the

423
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,660
whole piece of it all the way down to

424
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,880
the data that's very exciting because

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,340
it's probably in my mind this is one of

426
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,140
the easiest places to implement xero

427
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,580
Trust

428
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,360
and we should be demanding as an

429
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,600
industry demanding as a market that the

430
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,340
cloud security infrastructure that we

431
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,320
have and the cloud security strategy

432
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,539
that we have be able to be applied on

433
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,280
whatever the platform is

434
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,700
and whatever the Integrations are that

435
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,380
need to happen wherever they are

436
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,140
whatever they are those should be

437
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,080
available to you

438
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,179
and then on the network side and I left

439
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,340
this for last because while it is

440
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,260
probably the most common place it is one

441
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,720
of the most daunting places to implement

442
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
xero trust we have Legacy infrastructure

443
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,700
we have Legacy architecture we have an

444
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,620
expectation of very specific types of

445
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,419
services that are able to be delivered

446
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,620
so it's not as easy to drive a a robust

447
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,360
zero trust architecture in the network

448
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,820
that said it is capable of being done

449
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,340
today perimeter firewalls are now

450
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
capable of looking bi-directionally at

451
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,900
traffic and driving Dynamic policy and

452
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,539
identity based policy bi-directionally

453
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,660
this is something that has been a

454
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,460
benefit to organizations as they have

455
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,260
shifted to work from home and they've

456
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,260
had to collapse their remote offices

457
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,440
into cloud or into closets that were

458
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,260
very bi-directional to allow individuals

459
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,720
to come in through the closet

460
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,940
where they eliminated the robot office

461
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,299
and they turned it into uh just a closet

462
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,620
uh

463
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,360
um server setup that allowed them to

464
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,640
sort of pivot and come in through that

465
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,039
access point

466
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,960
inside the organization we see a

467
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,720
dramatic increase in iot security and

468
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,020
iot vulnerability a recent report said

469
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,080
that 90 percent of the security attacks

470
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
that are going on uh have come from iot

471
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
it wasn't uh this didn't come from

472
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,539
checkpoints research group it was

473
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:22,740
another research group that was out

474
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,620
there but iot has dramatically risen

475
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,200
with regards to its profile and its

476
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,260
attack surface and the manner in which

477
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,360
people are looking at iot

478
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,220
there are security measures that are

479
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
able to be taken in architecture and say

480
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,059
it'll be implemented that allows you to

481
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,380
identify

482
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,840
and allows you to segment dynamically

483
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,059
that iot environment inside an

484
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,059
Enterprise and drive controls to ensure

485
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,820
that iot environments that start to

486
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,100
demonstrate

487
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,179
aberrant Behavior are able to be

488
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,679
quarantined or able to be isolated

489
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,720
because they're able to be very rapidly

490
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,120
identified and moved

491
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,220
and then at the data center we now have

492
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,840
a hybrid data center that needs to be

493
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,700
able to integrate with the cloud and

494
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,460
needs to be able to drive that what I

495
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,620
call intelligent isolation and

496
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,080
segmentation into the data center

497
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
our uh our technology that's out there

498
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
today is capable of doing that uh not

499
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,780
just checkpoints I mean uh the network

500
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,179
security infrastructure now has come to

501
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,039
a place where it is able to drive many

502
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,679
of these particular requirements

503
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,480
um from the perimeter all the way down

504
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
into the data center and that's very

505
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,100
exciting automation orchestration the

506
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
entire bit being able to be fit in and

507
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,559
so we as an industry and we as a market

508
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,380
should be looking at how we're able to

509
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,200
improve our Network around authenticate

510
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
identity based authentication and

511
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,719
authorization

512
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,460
these are the four things that are

513
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,660
really uh strong capabilities inside of

514
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,059
our Network infrastructure uh that

515
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,980
exists out there today that all of you

516
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,419
are using today

517
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,740
um they typically are able to provide

518
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,419
prevention they're able to provide

519
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,299
automation they're able to provide

520
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,260
isolation and they're able to provide

521
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,660
resiliency all of which are tenants of a

522
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,740
zero trust architecture

523
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,440
so I wanted to go back and I wanted to

524
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,780
go back to the threat intelligence piece

525
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,220
that I talked at the beginning because I

526
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,419
think that there's a there's a key

527
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,600
tie-in between that and modern

528
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,700
modernizing our infrastructure and

529
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,659
looking at how we approach uh

530
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,640
zero trust

531
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,080
many many many years ago at the

532
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,880
beginning of my career I had a

533
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
university talk to me about managed

534
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,159
services and this concept of Time Versus

535
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,679
value they're like look our objective is

536
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,740
to take the people that we've hired that

537
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,720
are very smart and very capable people

538
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
we want to move them from mechanical and

539
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,820
operational tasks to strategic and

540
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,380
analytical tasks

541
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,380
and we need you and your solutions to

542
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,179
provide those mechanical and operational

543
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,880
value it's why we have a cycle that goes

544
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,220
from managed services to internal

545
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,140
services to manage services because

546
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,440
organizations are are struggling with a

547
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,260
balance between these two things

548
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,120
here's where threat intelligence comes

549
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,679
in and one of the exciting pieces about

550
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,299
threat intelligence

551
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,220
for many many many years threat

552
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,020
intelligence has been about being able

553
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,159
to get a feed so we as consumers get a

554
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,900
feed of threat intelligence where we're

555
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,400
able to look at a vulnerability we're

556
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,020
able to decode it we're able to

557
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,700
understand what it's about and we're

558
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,679
able to go on our own little threat hunt

559
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,659
and we're able to drive the technical

560
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,299
exercise of protecting our organization

561
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,919
implementing the policies and everything

562
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,419
that needs to be done

563
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,520
the modern role of threat intelligence

564
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,059
today is to eliminate that particular

565
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,820
operational task

566
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,020
threat intelligence today is so verbose

567
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,960
it is so enriched that the architecture

568
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,700
and technology that we Implement today

569
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,799
should be able to leverage it to

570
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,500
automate the types of policy changes

571
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,720
that need to happen we're already doing

572
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,220
this in the cloud

573
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,059
in the cloud as we move

574
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,179
as we move code from the left into

575
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,039
production

576
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,559
Cloud security technology today is able

577
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,120
to look at that and is able to make

578
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,179
Dynamic changes to least privilege is

579
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,400
able to assess and audit the code look

580
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,380
at infrastructure as code on kubernetes

581
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,140
to ensure that it is that it conforms to

582
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,539
best practice and gold standards and is

583
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,240
able to do all of those things and it's

584
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,780
able to base all of those changes

585
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,940
on threat intelligence artificial

586
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,580
intelligence and deep learning enable

587
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,919
that type of threat intelligence to now

588
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,340
change and rapidly adapt policy based on

589
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,200
the types of attacks and threats that

590
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,179
are occurring what are vulnerability

591
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,179
posture looks like at that time and make

592
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,760
changes posture Management in the cloud

593
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,720
is designed to automate change based off

594
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
of Regulation that we put in place we

595
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,880
say this must conform to the following

596
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,580
rules and now you're going to measure

597
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,100
that on a rapid basis all the time and

598
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
you're going to rapidly automate and fix

599
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,200
and and maintain the security of my

600
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,419
posture because I don't manage that

601
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,740
third party

602
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,980
posture that third party platform isn't

603
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,480
something that I manage

604
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,539
so threat intelligence is about taking

605
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,320
that that accurate prevention and

606
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,419
imparting it down into our network

607
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,880
security our Cloud security our

608
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,799
Workforce security and all of the other

609
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,600
third-party Integrations that we have

610
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,940
and making sure that the visibility and

611
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,220
operations that we have go back up into

612
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,159
there and that all of the Telemetry from

613
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,919
all of that infrastructure feeds up into

614
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,679
that threat intelligence this is what

615
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,020
healthy threat intelligence looks like

616
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,000
it's not simply getting a feed from

617
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,679
somewhere

618
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,620
it's having that feed Drive modern

619
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,140
Automation and orchestration it's why

620
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,240
we've created an entire industry around

621
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
soar

622
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
security orchestration and automation

623
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,700
tools that companies are able to buy

624
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,340
today Enterprises can Implement today to

625
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,020
automate all of the disparate solutions

626
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,700
that they have

627
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,799
what would be great

628
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,200
is if all of this

629
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,179
if all the things that I talked about

630
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,159
today

631
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,140
are Workforce security our Cloud

632
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,360
security and our network security

633
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,000
the different threat intelligence uh

634
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
components that we would need what would

635
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,140
be great is if all of that was available

636
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,200
inside one unified architecture

637
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
that allowed you to be able to drive

638
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
portable controls

639
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,500
across all three of those particular

640
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,720
zero trust pillars

641
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,760
and to drive the Automation and

642
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,640
orchestration holistically

643
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,919
where it's not having to go up to a

644
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
different tool to go through human data

645
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,539
analytics and come back down

646
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,640
the technology today is Advanced enough

647
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,039
that we're able to do this

648
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,200
um it's it's the reticence of us moving

649
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
rapidly into that that prevents us from

650
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
actually driving faster and and more

651
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,940
effective security and I think that

652
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,700
that's one of the reasons why uh when I

653
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,080
look at what the federal government is

654
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,900
doing around zero trust it's so

655
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,520
compelling and it's so exciting what

656
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,500
they've done is they've decided that

657
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
they no longer can rely on the older

658
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,000
traditional architectures that they had

659
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,220
and they need to start taking it taking

660
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,260
advantage of the advancements that that

661
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,480
are here for the last three years I have

662
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,140
sat in uh at conferences and I have sat

663
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,620
on Executive CSO panels where I have

664
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,260
heard csos from some of the largest

665
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,720
organizations talk about orchestration

666
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,640
and automation about artificial

667
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,679
intelligence and machine learning and

668
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,659
the need to have solutions that are able

669
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,460
to drive it what I'm here to tell you

670
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,159
today is is that these actually do exist

671
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,860
today and that they are being modernized

672
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,299
across several of the different

673
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,340
solutions that are out there it's why

674
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,700
you see so much rapid acquisition and

675
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,620
integration coming across all the

676
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
different suppliers that are out there

677
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,700
it's a very exciting time zero trust

678
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,179
actually has a place in our

679
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,480
um uh within our architecture today it's

680
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,740
something that we're actually able to

681
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,740
implement much more effectively today

682
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,600
10 years ago we would have a very hard

683
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,260
time talking about driving

684
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,940
micro segmentation inside our data

685
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,039
center today you're able to look at

686
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,740
emerging best of breed technology that

687
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,900
drives that micro segmentation in the

688
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,340
data center it's not something the

689
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,020
checkpoint provides it's something that

690
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm extremely excited about though there

691
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,440
are suppliers that are out there that

692
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,299
are doing it today all the way down to

693
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,400
the memory and the application Level

694
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,860
looking at the processes and are able to

695
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,480
drive zero trust all the way down to

696
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,000
that level in the data center

697
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,700
um which is an incredibly powerful thing

698
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,679
for many organizations out there that

699
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
need to have that type of isolation

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,299
that's the end of my presentation any

701
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,740
questions

702
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,539
from anyone

703
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,919
otherwise I know that we're at the end

704
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,659
of the day you guys have probably had a

705
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,100
very long day

706
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,418
a very exciting day out there

707
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,779
anything

708
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,179
all right

709
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,220
great thank you very very much guys for

710
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,260
listening have a great rest of your day

711
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,100
and a great time tomorrow
