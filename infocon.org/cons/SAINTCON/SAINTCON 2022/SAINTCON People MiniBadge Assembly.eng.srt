1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,040
all right let's go ahead and get started

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,520
this is the video tutorial for how to

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
put together the saintcon attendee or

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
people mini badge there's four different

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,639
versions of this badge out and about uh

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,320
one is for attendees there's one for

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,480
speakers there's one for volunteers and

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
there's one for committee and staff

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
members but let's go ahead

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
and dig into

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,279
uh this badge so inside the bag

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,439
uh there's several components first and

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,159
foremost there is the pcb or the circuit

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
board

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
there is an led

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
that's a through-hole led

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,480
there's a resistor

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
that's a surface mount resistor and then

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,920
there's four of these two position pin

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
headers we'll go ahead and set those

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,680
aside for a minute

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,800
uh and we can

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,800
get to those in just a moment

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
okay so the pcb board here has a

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
fingerprint design on the front face

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
that's the front and the back has just

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
an oval design and places for a couple

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
of the components

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,400
in order to assemble this we want to

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,799
start on the back side first and the

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,240
first component that we're going to put

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
onto this board is the resistor and in

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
order to do that to locate the position

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
for the resistor

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
right here near the top

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
and it depends on which badge you have

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,200
that you're putting together but this

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
resistor pad might be twisted 90 degrees

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
but in either case there's two pads that

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
make up the resistor component surface

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
and the way that we solder this and make

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
it easiest is to put one side or put

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
solder on one side and one side only at

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
a time and so what we're going to do is

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
i'm going to zoom this camera in

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
and i'm going to kind of show you right

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
up close or as close as i can kind of

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
get it let me make a little adjustment

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,560
to the light here so you can see

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
i might even

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
get even closer

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
so you can see that board and let's kind

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
of go from there so anyways as you can

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
see here we have the resistor pad up

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
here which consists of these two things

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
what we're going to do

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
to make this easiest

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,038
is we're going to use a one pad solder

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
our hand solder technique which is we're

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
going to take a soldering iron it's got

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,080
a good hot and clean tip

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
the the heat on this is at about 750

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
degrees fahrenheit and what i'm going to

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
do is i'm just going to put this

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
soldering iron and touch and hold it on

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,480
that pad and just kind of feed a tiny

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
dab

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,520
of solder onto it

69
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
so i'm going to get that right up to the

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
camera here so you can see that a little

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,200
bit better

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
but it's literally just this kind of

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,519
little dab of solder

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
on that one side of that uh

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,519
of that

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
or of those two pads excuse me

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,319
okay and then i'm going to take the

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
resistor and i'm going to kind of stab

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,560
it with this tweezers just don't stab

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
yourselves and then you kind of just

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
take the top half of this off

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,400
and the resistor kind of opens up in

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
there if you're not careful you can kind

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,040
of snap it or bump it and that resistor

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
will go flying across the room

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,239
um but in this case there's the resistor

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
resistors do not have a polarity so it

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
doesn't matter which direction they go

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,840
and so i'm just going to set it on like

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,519
this um and what you do is you kind of

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,920
set it and get it kind of in place where

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
you want it

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
and the best way to take care of this is

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,159
to just rest gently the tweezers on top

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
of that resistor when it's bridging both

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
pads and i'm just going to heat up that

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
one side and what you'll feel is that

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
resistor will sink underneath of your

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,000
tweezers

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
and it will become

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
or it'll kind of sink into that blob of

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
solder on that side becoming connected

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
and so now even with my fingernail you

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
can't really easily

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
pull that off and so it's on there but

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
it's only on or it's only connected on

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
one side so we need the soldering iron

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
one more time

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
and we're just going to

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
heat up that pad underneath and flow

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,519
just a tiny bit of solder into it

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
and that is all it takes you saw that it

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,480
was just a tiny dab of solder uh to make

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
that work and so the resistor is the

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
hardest part to put on this particular

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
mini badge and so if you've gotten this

117
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
far you're doing great next thing we're

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
going to do is we're going to

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,358
connect the led and so in order to do

120
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,238
that

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
i'm going to use some this little tool

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
right here that'll make life a little

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
bit easier for us

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
you probably have something like this as

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,639
well

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
something to plug mini badges into it

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
just makes it easier to hold the mini

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
badge down while we're doing what we're

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
doing so

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
next component that we're putting

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
together is this through-hole led

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
and so this is a special led that does

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
color changing

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
um which makes it really cool looking it

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
has a really awesome effect

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,360
um

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
the l or the leads on an led the longer

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,160
lead is the positive side of the led in

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,280
this case

140
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,520
and the positive side always goes

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
through on these people mini badges

142
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
the

143
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,840
circle side of the mini badge but this

144
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,199
is going to be a little bit deceiving

145
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,039
because you'd think that you'd put the

146
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,039
led on the front but that's not the case

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,240
we're going to use this little

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
contraption right here

149
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
to just kind of hold this mini badge in

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,440
place

151
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,639
while we stick the long side of the led

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
through the circle hole

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,440
and you'll notice

154
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
and it's just kind of plugging into the

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
bottom here so it kind of holds this

156
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
thing in place but you'll notice that

157
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
the bottom side of the l or the of the

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
mini badge is facing up and that is the

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,520
correct way to do this at this point

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
and so what we want to do is we want to

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
stick this led in but we don't want to

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
stick it all the way to the bottom if

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
you can see i shoved it all the way to

164
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
the bottom there i want i want you to

165
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,039
pull it out to where it's just kind of

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
resting at the top here

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
um so that it's held in place and so

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
this this is kind of a little trick to

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,479
to make it easier to solder it

170
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
uh effectively and so once that led is

171
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
just kind of sitting in there you're

172
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
gonna get your solder and your soldering

173
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
iron and you're just gonna

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
touch that bottom pad

175
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,280
feed some solder into it

176
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,679
and

177
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
connect both sides

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,240
of that led to the board then you kind

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
of just pull it off of there you can see

180
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,000
how it was being held in by the little

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
the holes over here but that's about how

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
you want it one word of caution here

183
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,639
real quick is that some of the leds that

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
we've provided are much longer on the

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
the leads and you might have to trim it

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,360
down

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
the right amount of spacing to make what

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
we're going to do work is about to have

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
a half of an inch from the surface of

190
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,479
the board to the bottom of the led

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
doesn't have to be exact it's just an

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
approximate we'll make it work

193
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
and to get the effect that we want for

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
this led or for this mini badge

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
we're going to bend this

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
led over and point it into the center of

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,680
this oval shape and so the best way to

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
do that is grab your tweezers and just

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
kind of set it up against that led like

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
this it's kind of hard to see here

201
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,599
and then push down and kind of bend that

202
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
led over

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
and then you're going to kind of push up

204
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
against it with

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
the tweezers again and you're going to

206
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
kind of push that led so that it just

207
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,039
bends over

208
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
and the center part of that led and i'm

209
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
just going to use the tweezers here to

210
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
kind of

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
manipulate it and adjust it a little bit

212
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
but we want the center part of that led

213
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
as much as possible

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
to be pointing at about the center part

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
of this

216
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
uh oval so you kind of push this around

217
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,160
and

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
kind of bend that if you bend it back

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
and forth too much those will break and

220
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,759
that's not what you want it doesn't have

221
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
to be perfect

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
but this is essentially the effect that

223
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
you're looking for is you want that led

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
turned over and pointing to that

225
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
to the board on the back side and then

226
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
just get your straight cut pliers that

227
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
are available all over the tables in the

228
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
circuit assembly area and you're just

229
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,720
gonna snip

230
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
flush the front part

231
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
of this mini badge so that the front

232
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
part looks like that

233
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
and the back part looks like this and

234
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
then after that it's super simple

235
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,599
to finish this up you get your same

236
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
board here that we used as as our

237
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
placeholder

238
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
uh for the led and you're just gonna

239
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
stick these headers

240
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
in each of the four corners

241
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
just like that so you can see those

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
headers are there and then you just set

243
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,200
this mini badge on top right there it's

244
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
a convenient way to hold it all in place

245
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
and keep it all nice and snug while

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
we're soldering

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
and then literally to finish this up

248
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
you're just heating up that pin

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
adding a little bit of solder

250
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
same thing here i'm doing kind of doing

251
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
the outside edges or at least one of

252
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,640
each first we're gonna do all eight

253
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
but in order to be convenient with the

254
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,519
soldering iron i'm just gonna turn it

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
around to make it easier to reach and

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
we're just gonna fill in

257
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
each one

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
of these contact points

259
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
with solder

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
and that completes this particular mini

261
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
badge

262
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
um let me see if i've got a battery here

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,959
that i can

264
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
put into

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
this mini bag so i'm going to move this

266
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
slots because i know that other slot

267
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
might have a little bit of a problem

268
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,600
from something we did earlier

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
and i just happen to know how this gets

270
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,279
connected here but i think

271
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
we can force

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,360
that mini badge to light up so you can

273
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
see now

274
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
in fact if i turn off the light here and

275
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
maybe turn this one off here give me one

276
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,240
sec

277
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
you can actually see

278
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,720
the blinking function and the color

279
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
changing

280
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
uh that occurs with that led uh lighting

281
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,600
up the back side of that so it's a

282
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
really cool effect

283
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
uh for each one of the attendee mini

284
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,560
badges i hope that you enjoy it
