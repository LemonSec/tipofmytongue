1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
you know what we wanted to have an

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,179
opportunity or I wanted to have an

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,100
opportunity to talk a little bit about

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,300
the future of Utah Saint and Saint Khan

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,639
uh the slides you're about to see are a

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,160
great representation of ADD

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,480
and so they're going to be all over the

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,220
place but if there's some things you

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,800
can't glean out of what we're doing and

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,480
stuff in here that are helpful to you or

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,220
fill a gap somewhere

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,920
that's really the intent here I'm hoping

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,439
that there's a lot of our committee uh

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,180
Board of Trustees and other folks that

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,340
join us in here and can answer some of

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,260
the questions that you might have about

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,480
the organization and what we do and how

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,760
we do things and the conference and

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,739
everything else so that's really it and

20
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,360
it's not going to take a full hour I

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,160
don't I mean if if we take a full hour

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,660
that's because you guys have a lot of

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
questions uh because there's only

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,399
probably about 20 or 20 or 30 minutes of

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,100
slides here uh which will give you your

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,840
last opportunity to go down and trade

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,460
any of the many badges that you've got

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,980
anybody not get a Yoda mini badge in

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,879
here

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,899
holy crud

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,240
and

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040
I don't think there was a class for the

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,740
Yoda mini badge ever like so here's the

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,020
thing this morning we found a bag of

35
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,299
Yoda mini badges that was kind of

36
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,400
stuffed underneath of the something that

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,439
was never supposed to be undone or

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
whatever so I literally have in a bag

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
right here don't come up here yet

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,979
probably I would say 20 to 25 of them

41
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,680
and I will hand them out to you on my

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,380
way out the door after this presentation

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,240
so if you didn't get one there's

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,860
probably not enough for everybody who

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,200
raised your hand but if you had one

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,240
already don't raise your hand or get a

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,500
second one because there's so many

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
people that didn't get one and uh I

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,540
guess I just failed in the number of in

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,040
or the amount of interest there are in

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Yoda mini badges this year because man

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
I can't walk 10 feet without hey

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,259
until you have one of those and it's

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,880
been so awesome I'm sorry I'm a little

55
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,740
tangent here before we even get started

56
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,560
but it's been so awesome to meet so many

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,098
people I I just had forgotten how

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,440
conversational a mini batch can be when

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,459
you're sitting there and you're catching

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,540
up with people

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,760
uh and such and so I've had a chance to

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
meet so many people uh many for the

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
first time and many that uh I consider

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,260
you know many of us consider St Khan as

65
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
a family reunion of sorts you know you

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,060
get to see the security folks that

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,300
you've worked with or met and you know

68
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,180
done things online with or whatever and

69
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,280
put names to faces and things it's also

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
a wonderful event so we love putting it

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
on and that's why we're here so we're

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,379
going to talk just a little bit about it

73
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,760
but we're going to talk about the pants

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,540
issue first

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,879
so

76
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,180
[Applause]

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,700
here's the history and I'm still seeking

78
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,980
information as I was mentioning so many

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,400
years ago we took these very cool photos

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
of all of the committee members that

81
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,580
were the planning committee for Saint

82
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,560
Khan and it was one of those kind of

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
pose things and it was you know waist up

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
shot and we put it on the website to to

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,819
give recognition to the people that put

86
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,220
tons of energy and effort

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,620
and of course somebody's going to take

88
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,760
that and find some other image and

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,860
Photoshop them together and it became

90
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,560
this ongoing Meme and they did such a

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
good job that people were like hey do

92
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,280
you did you actually wear those and is

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,500
that a photo or not you know so you can

94
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
tell the top part's black and white the

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
bottom part has color it's Photoshop

96
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,440
together but I still to this day don't

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,300
know who

98
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,060
created this but it pops up every year

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,400
and I figured you know what hey it's

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,580
time to just own it

101
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,640
like if if I own the meme then I I have

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,360
the power right so hey I'm owning it

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,980
so that's the story so if you're

104
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,959
wondering I'm not trying to you know do

105
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,819
anything other than just own own a meme

106
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,900
and maybe

107
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,360
help kill it finally or whatever

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
but let's get into a couple of a couple

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,239
of things for those of you that are new

110
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,239
uh to the to Saint Khan how many of your

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,280
first timers so you're kind of in here

112
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
just wondering what the heck is this

113
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,639
thing or whatever okay good there's a

114
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,738
lot of you here like it blows our mind

115
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,199
how many new people churn in every

116
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,600
single year for Saint Khan but let me

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,620
give you just a little bit of history

118
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,100
about Saint con okay Saint Khan is a

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,720
conference that has actually been going

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,900
for 21 years

121
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,940
but it's probably something you've never

122
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,180
heard of until the last five to six

123
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,860
years

124
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,620
um and what it was is it was an it was a

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,540
conference that we started running out

126
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,120
of the Utah education Network now the

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,580
Utah education and Telehealth Network

128
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,160
many many years ago because I I got to a

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,680
point in my career where I was somehow

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
in charge of this new thing called

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,360
security 20 some odd years ago

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,060
and we would go out and we would visit

133
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,820
the people throughout the state and we

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,199
would find out that

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,240
we don't even have firewalls in place

136
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,919
like they're we're not doing anything

137
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,020
what's security like yeah we know that

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,340
there's hackers and things but they're

139
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,860
not like they're not after us we're just

140
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,560
people in Utah and things and so it

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,180
became very apparent very quickly that

142
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,039
we needed to start having conversations

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,560
about security and so with the help of

144
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,160
uetn we started the security Summit and

145
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
I think the first one of those was in

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,620
2001. and that was 25 people from most

147
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,020
of like education and some state

148
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,699
government folks and the things that we

149
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,160
got into a room up on the University of

150
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,020
Utah Campus and we just talked about

151
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,600
security for a couple of days and it

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
blew everybody's mind it's like oh my

153
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,080
gosh I had no idea that you could do

154
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,699
this and we showed people how to hack

155
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,860
things and and gave them the tools like

156
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,660
hey why don't you just try this and see

157
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,639
and it's amazing and hopefully many of

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,500
you had this experience during sync on

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,759
this year where

160
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,400
where you've had that aha moment like

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,919
who's picked themselves out of handcuffs

162
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,780
for the first time in their lives

163
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,960
this week right was that an aha moment I

164
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,000
hope that was that you're like this is

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
not that hard and the thing is is when

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,500
you start looking at security and other

167
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,720
things you can realize that there's a

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
lot of vulnerabilities and a lot of

169
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,919
things that we need to protect uh and

170
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,740
and make better and so anyways the

171
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,560
history of the Utah Saints conference

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,120
and things

173
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,380
um

174
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,740
it's it grew a little bit year over year

175
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,720
and there was several years where there

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,660
was about 150 of us I think was that

177
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
critical mass for many years and we held

178
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
it down in St George beautiful area down

179
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,340
there it's nice and warm in October you

180
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,919
know and such but we would hold it down

181
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,539
there and it would be about that same

182
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,400
150 people every single year that we

183
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,039
would do this and we had so much fun in

184
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,419
fact they're used to break we used to

185
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,160
break out in Nerf gun fights in the

186
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,319
middle of talks we used to throw things

187
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,960
at the presenters I mean it was a little

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,940
it was a lot more

189
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,759
I don't know what's the right word there

190
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,000
mischievous I don't know

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,440
Rowdy that's the word a little more

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,300
Rowdy and stuff but we had so much fun

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,220
and we would have the craziest people

194
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,900
come up and present you know who they

195
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,539
were it was that guy right there it was

196
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,340
this guy right here and we didn't know

197
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,780
everything there was to know about

198
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,000
security at the time but we'd learned

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,259
something and it was like we're going to

200
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,300
share this you know like hey did you

201
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,160
know that if you actually started

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,699
blocking ports and protocols like you

203
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,919
could do some really cool things and

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,440
that was where this kind of started

205
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,360
um and so it graduated year over year

206
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,220
and what we ended up doing back in about

207
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,060
2006 2007 is we created in kind of

208
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,759
conjunction with it an informal group it

209
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,620
was literally just hey you want to be on

210
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,060
a mailing list and we'll talk about this

211
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,220
stuff and we created something called

212
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,520
the Utah Saint group

213
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,979
um and it kind of became just the same

214
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,539
people that come to the conference and

215
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,759
other things and we would let them join

216
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,740
the mailing list and we'd email things

217
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,479
back and forth and like hey this is what

218
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm seeing because it created more

219
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
timely conversations rather than just

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,940
once a year it's like we could talk

221
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,620
about things then we went through a

222
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,020
process of vetting and making sure that

223
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,720
everybody on that list was cleared to

224
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,280
hear the information that we were going

225
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,319
to talk about and stuff we went through

226
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,300
all these kinds of things but once we

227
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,220
created that organization it was started

228
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,319
to be called the Utah Saint conference

229
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,419
from that point forward and it proceeded

230
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,799
to be called the Utah Saint conference

231
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,020
until about I want to say 2013 2014

232
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
like I said I have a headache it's kind

233
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,640
of I'm fuzzy on dates right now or even

234
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
years at this point we'll get it close

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,320
to a year anyways then we get to the

236
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
point where we're at the slide what we

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,580
decided to do because of the complexity

238
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,940
of the conference and everything else is

239
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,540
we formed a 501c6 non-profit membership

240
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,700
Organization for the Utah Saint

241
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,519
organization that's what we called it

242
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,940
and as as things became more complicated

243
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,440
uh and things with the conference and

244
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,820
some of the other Outreach we were doing

245
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,940
we started running the Utah sync

246
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,140
conference out of this 501c6

247
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,820
and created a Board of Trustees and

248
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,839
everything else I'll talk about here in

249
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,399
a minute bottom line is

250
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,740
we're here and we have this organization

251
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,420
and I'll bring you up to the current

252
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,220
history here in a minute but our mission

253
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,320
really hasn't changed the Utah Saint

254
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,140
organization provides community and

255
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,720
education to cyber security and I.T

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
professionals that's our mission that's

257
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
what we do

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
um it's it's an it's evolved over time

259
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,580
and we include more people in different

260
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,279
communities and other things and we we

261
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,160
it started very much in the roots of

262
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,620
education so if you see a lot of people

263
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,380
if you're in edu in K-12 or higher ed

264
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,000
education raise your hand if you're

265
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,100
willing to okay if you look around the

266
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,660
room and you're not familiar there's a

267
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,779
lot of us here because that growth came

268
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,420
out of that Utah education Network we're

269
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,580
kind of just working on some things and

270
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,279
stuff and so a lot of people here come

271
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,940
from that background uh and but we

272
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
opened it up and started taking in

273
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,420
private Industries and other people

274
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,980
because we knew that if we grew our

275
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,019
security Community that's a lot more

276
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,580
voices and a lot more talent and

277
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,880
capabilities coming in and and feeding

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
into this and so it benefited us in a

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,480
big way it also became that spark that

280
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,180
you lights you know that starts burning

281
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,740
and you get to a point where it's going

282
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,940
down and you know that there's a big old

283
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,800
dynamic might block over here that it's

284
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
going to hit at some point because all

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
of a sudden it blows up into oh my gosh

286
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,040
this conference and what we're doing is

287
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
actually a thing and it's not just 150

288
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
people in a room talking weird things

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,959
about security

290
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,060
and anyways there that's the evolution

291
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,100
that we're dealing or we're going

292
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
through volunteer non-profit wanted to

293
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,839
help you understand that everybody that

294
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,339
participates in the Utah Saint

295
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,660
organization

296
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,480
is a volunteer there is not a single

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,339
paid

298
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,720
employee or or anything else for that

299
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,880
organization and we built it that way

300
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,579
it's in our bylaws that we do that it's

301
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,760
that way so there's no paid person the

302
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,740
the organization so here's the

303
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,940
governance of the organization the

304
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,800
leadership the Utah State organization

305
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,959
is run by a Board of Trustees a board

306
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,700
chairman a secretary and a Treasurer or

307
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,040
the primary officers and then we have a

308
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
bunch of other trustees that are part of

309
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,140
a voting committee that helps Orient and

310
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,420
run the art or the organization and

311
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,339
again they are all volunteers they're

312
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,100
giving their time and talents to do this

313
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,800
uh underneath of that is the conference

314
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,540
planning committee and they get a lot of

315
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,100
praise and everything else but they are

316
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,019
technically separate many of the Board

317
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,120
of Trustees members are on the planning

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,740
committee as well but the conference

319
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,620
planning committee is organized by the

320
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,360
board chairman of the organization is

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
responsible for overseeing all planning

322
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,160
for the saint con conference this

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,959
process begins each January and the

324
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,160
volunteers are responsible for

325
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
everything that happens here

326
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,200
there's also a membership committee uh

327
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,579
formed in the Utah State organization

328
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,200
who's responsible for handling all

329
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,000
membership functions and activities this

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,959
is whether you want to join the

331
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,820
organization whether you're like I'm out

332
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,500
I don't think we've ever had that really

333
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,360
happen but

334
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,500
um you know those types of things

335
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
there's a membership committee and

336
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,560
that's how we're that's how we're

337
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
structured we're pretty simple this

338
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,500
isn't you know when you're working with

339
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
volunteers and everything else it's not

340
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,519
like we've got this big conglomerate or

341
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,620
anything else going on it's it's very

342
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,399
simplistic and it takes tons of hours to

343
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
do all the tax work and all the other

344
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,139
things that happen with that

345
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,240
organization so it's it's kind of a

346
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,000
thing so what we do uh you know bringing

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
us into a little bit more modern history

348
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
or anything else St Khan is obviously

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
now the primary event that the Utah

350
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,920
Saint organization puts on and it

351
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
continues to grow in size and complexity

352
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,899
every single year

353
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,880
okay a couple of other things that the

354
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,980
Utah State organization does that were

355
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,200
that maybe is a little less known so

356
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,339
you're going to want to get your cameras

357
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,540
out here in just a second I'm going to

358
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,579
show you a slide that you might want to

359
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,500
take a picture of maybe maybe not okay

360
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,120
but one of the other things that we do

361
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,680
is we have semi-weekly security

362
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,959
briefings

363
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,180
if you've not heard of those you're

364
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,380
going to have a slide here with the link

365
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,320
on in just a moment to join those okay

366
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,720
every other week we get together as an

367
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,820
organization as a group and we talk

368
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,940
about all of the current threats risks

369
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,980
vulnerabilities things that you should

370
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,500
be working on or new trends and tactics

371
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,959
that are emerging that you might want to

372
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,760
have some understanding about it lasts

373
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,220
anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes of

374
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,800
your time it's live we do it in WebEx or

375
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,540
Zoom or some other platform like that so

376
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
it's interactive if you've got a

377
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,019
question you can ask a question or if

378
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,120
you have something that you see that's

379
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,760
emerging or coming up that you think is

380
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
interesting There's an opportunity at

381
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
the end of their at the end of The

382
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
Briefing to present that and talk about

383
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,959
it and it's actually how many of you in

384
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,519
the room participate at least on some

385
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,899
regular basis in those briefings there

386
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,180
should be quite a few hands okay because

387
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,279
we end up having between 70 and 100

388
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,399
people every session participating in in

389
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,680
that briefing most of the time it's just

390
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,899
me you get more me I don't know why is

391
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,139
just me but you get more me telling you

392
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,420
everything about what's going on based

393
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,459
off of my limited capabilities of

394
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,220
researching and so Community input and

395
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,040
Community Driven content is something I

396
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,480
really appreciate there

397
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,399
but that's one of the other things we do

398
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,200
and then we also do education Outreach

399
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,139
we have as you can see downstairs we

400
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,540
have like 40 soldering irons we've got

401
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,300
all kinds of video equipment and

402
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
microphones and PA systems and other

403
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,019
things we purchased over the years to

404
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,540
facilitate events in the conference that

405
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,760
we lend out so if you are in a space

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,380
where you're doing education whether

407
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,440
that's a local group whether that's a

408
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,420
religious or church group or whether

409
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,060
that's an education group and you need

410
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,639
30 soldering irons if you're a member of

411

things

415
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,420
based off of what we've got we don't

416
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,220
just like buy them for you or whatever

417
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,620

facilitate you taking

419
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,240
um and enriching some sort of Education

420
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,579
activity uh within those types of groups

421
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,899
and so

422
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,600
um it's really great uh for medium sized

423
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,120
groups and teaching security topics and

424
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,139
other things that's our mission that's

425
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,940
what we do so those are the primary

426
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,320
things that the Utah State organization

427
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,560
functions on this is the URL if you want

428

432
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,180
MailChimp sign up list and what that's

433
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,620
essentially doing this is subscribing

434
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,600
you to the list where you'll only get

435

hold on you'll get one email every other

437
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,440
week and it's not just like a hey a

438

this week or maybe that's hey let's see

445
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,639

446
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,800
cancel my other meeting and join or not

447

welcome to join us

450
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,720
what generally happens is the first few

451
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,339
right after the saint con all of a

452
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,480
sudden it turns into we're trying to

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,000
cram 500 people into a zoom room

454
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,920
and everybody kind of gauges whether

455
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,779
it's effective or not the next briefing

456
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,220
will be this coming Wednesday so

457
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,199
like five seven days or whatever it is I

458
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,160
don't even know what day it is today

459
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,779
hardly

460
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,100
um so anyways if you would like please

461
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,800
join okay so let's talk about Saint Khan

462
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,540
because

463
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,000
it's it's kind of a thing

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,779
um

465
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,579
Saint Khan comes from humble beginnings

466
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,139
I think I've shared some of the stories

467
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,300
about where we come from and and how we

468
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,980
got here

469
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,600
um or I got you up to the point where we

470
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,740
were calling it The Utah Saint

471
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,780
conference and we would hold it in

472
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,419
different places all around the state

473
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,679
um and then we finally got to the point

474
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,500
to where we were getting 300 and 400

475
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,179
people coming to this conference and we

476
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,959
had to start like renting out the entire

477
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,240
Union building at the at Weber State

478
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,220
University and things to hold these

479
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,240
these things

480
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
and uh it was about that time I think it

481
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,679
was 2015 that we called it Saint Khan

482
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,919
anybody want to correct me on that 2015

483
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,900
is when we changed it over and called it

484
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,559
Saint con uh instead does anybody know

485
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,480
why we call it Saint con or where Utah

486
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,000
Saint and those things come from

487
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,520
anybody curious I mean that's kind of a

488
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,980
whole different story or whatever else

489
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,140
um and things but when we created that

490
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,660
Utah Saint organization it wasn't

491
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,580
you know anything about any sort of

492
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,740
religiosity or anything else it was we

493
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,299
created This Acronym the security

494
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,340
advisory and incident Network team that

495
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,140
spelled out Saint and it was kind of

496
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,360
cool so the proper way to spell it is

497
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,919
Utah with u capitalized ta uncapitalized

498
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
but Saint is all capitalized if you want

499
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
to follow our style guide you know

500
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,820
um excuse me

501
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,039
but that's what it is

502
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,780
um the it's the security advisory and

503
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,000
incident Network team for Utah

504
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,840
um and so it was really hard to fit Utah

505
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,240
Saint conference on all of our materials

506
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,520
and things in some format so we just we

507
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,780
truncated it and that's why it's called

508
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,760
Saint Khan and that's why whenever you

509
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,679
see it officially it's all capitalized

510
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,980
because it's sankcon anyways there you

511
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,020
go there's your history for the day

512
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,700
um we began opening it up to the world

513
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,559
when we renamed it to syncon meaning

514
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,539
that we no longer just advertised it and

515
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,520
talked to or talked about it to

516
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,140
education the state government and some

517
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,820
of these other areas and from that point

518
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,799
it just started we lit that fuse and it

519
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,840
started exploding and size and

520
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,600
complexity driven growth is now becoming

521
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,360
our biggest problem with Saint con

522
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,400
um and I can kind of talk to you a

523
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
little bit about it it has to do with

524
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,940
volunteerism and and everything else

525
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,340
meaning that as I mentioned we're all

526
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,200
volunteers there's nobody that makes

527
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,700
money off of this conference or anything

528
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,640
else and when you have a day job and

529
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,500
you're responsible for all the things in

530
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,640
your day job and everything else

531
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,700
everything becomes nights and weekends

532
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
and we burn a lot of nights and weekends

533
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,440
to the point to where there's a lot of

534
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
burnout that happens with the planning

535
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,419
committee with staff members that are in

536
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,340
charge of contests or communities or

537
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,080
events and everything else but it's a

538
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
labor of love I put it in there and it's

539
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,480
it's managed fairly well up to this

540
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,460
point because of the community that we

541
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,980
have and you probably heard me say it

542
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,840
many times in different talks and it's

543
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,460
kind of cliche a little bit at this

544
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,780
point but Utah does have by far the best

545
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,000
cyber security community of anywhere

546
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,900
I've ever seen

547
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,299
and it's true

548
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,480
I mean it's weird and crazy that here in

549
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,200
this we'll call it Podunk State you know

550
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,900
that we can get 1500 people together to

551
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,240
talk about cyber security and 80 to 90

552
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,280
percent of them are from the state of

553
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,380
Utah I mean it's a big deal we do a lot

554
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,600
of cool things here but with

555
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,520
volunteerism there's only so much you

556
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,220
can put on people and so growth is our

557
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,900
challenge meaning that all of a sudden

558
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,539
we went from 1200 people last year

559
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,980
approximately that attended the

560
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,500
conference to this year it's 1500 people

561
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,539
that attended the conference and if you

562
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,580
can imagine just for a minute in fact I

563
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,840
think I've got a slide for it here

564
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,860
because we talked about nights and

565
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,780
weekends I should mention here that

566
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,360
Saint con now just for all the things

567
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,220
that you get to participate in takes

568
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,160
approximately six months of planning

569
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,740
we start in January

570
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,740
and then we really start in March and

571
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,320
then we start really good in April

572
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,900
and then by May we're spending nights

573
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,299
and weekends a couple of times a week by

574
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,520
June and July that's nights and weekends

575
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,080
every week

576
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,179
and then August September October I

577
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,280
don't think we even sleep like we have

578
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,900
to start doing the overnights and

579
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,940
weekends kind of things but let's talk

580
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,799
about the other issues here and that's

581
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,860
Logistics you probably noticed those of

582
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,240
you that have been long time Saint con

583
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,000
attendees that we've always had

584
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,520
opportunities for like discounts and and

585
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,559
hey just kind of work out your

586
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,539
connections with these folks and other

587
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,360
things to get into the conference and

588
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,500
everything else and we took all those

589
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,600
away this year we didn't do that because

590
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
we're in there for the money grab or

591
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,380
anything else like that but I'll tell

592
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,900
you what every time we create some sort

593
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,600
of exception at this point at this

594
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,740
volume the logistics explode

595
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,140
into a million different directions and

596
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,179
it becomes super hard because now that

597
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,559
person that's in charge of registration

598
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,360
if they have to deal with more than just

599
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,179
one ticket type and one registration

600
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,679
process and now we have to have

601
00:21:58,679 --> 00:21:59,880
discounts and then we have to have

602
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,320
discounts on discounts and then we have

603
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
to have discount codes and then we have

604
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,159
to have redeemable codes versus

605
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,620
registration codes can you see real

606
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,419
quickly how it just gets out of hand and

607
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,460
so we started doing a way

608
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,380
and we're starting to try and streamline

609
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,080
and simplify all of our processes and so

610
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,059
that's the reason why we've done that in

611
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,380
case that was a question for from

612
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,280
anybody

613
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,559
and so we are trying drastically or

614
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,600
desperately to standardize our processes

615
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,539
to make this be more successful and to

616
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,220
take a lot of this load off a lot of

617
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,620
these volunteers and such and so a

618
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,820
couple of the other challenges I think

619
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,320
are worth mentioning here other than

620
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,240
Logistics in fact we have two people in

621
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,980
our Logistics department now

622
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,780
just to manage all of those little

623
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,299
things like every time you get one of

624
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,860
those attendee bags even though there

625
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,480
wasn't a ton of stuff in there this year

626
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
somebody had to go through and procure

627
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
all that stuff bring it all in put it

628
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,760
all in bags and there's 1500 of you guys

629
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,760
now that's a lot of work we spent an

630
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,440
entire weekend putting together

631
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,140
registration bags in my house

632
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,720
kind of crazy anyways some are some of

633
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,340
the other challenges uh that we have

634
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,780
storage

635
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,080
we now have so much junk

636
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
because if you think about it as we've

637
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,740
evolved the conference we used to do all

638
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,539
of our own AV meaning that we would

639
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,760
bring our projectors we would bring our

640
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,500
cameras we would bring our audio systems

641
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,120
of everything that we needed in order to

642
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
make it work because paying for the

643
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,080
venues in-house systems and other things

644
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,600
were not it's not something that we

645
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,919
could do

646
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,780
um at the time and so now we're getting

647
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,980
to the point where we've got all this

648
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,780
extra stuff over the years that we've

649
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,059
collected and it sits in a storage unit

650
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,280
for 11 and a half months out of the year

651
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,980
most of the time uh and so so we

652
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,260
struggle with that staging

653
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,940
um we struggle with a lot of that too

654
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,100
getting ready for the conference and

655
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,340
such we struggle with setup sometimes we

656
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,440
do have a wonderful volunteer effort

657
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,780
that comes in and helps us set up but

658
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,880
it's unorganized like you're not coming

659
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,740
in here with hey you're supposed to do

660
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,000
this it's

661
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
in fact it's when I'll I'll say this and

662
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,780
I don't mean this in any sort of

663
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,700
negative way but when somebody comes up

664
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,580
to me on Sunday or Monday it says hey

665
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,480
what can I do to help

666
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,100
the thing is is it's not like it's

667
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,080
almost like I don't know

668
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,419
what you can do to help go find somebody

669
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,000
that's doing something and help them you

670
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,679
know because they all think that I'm

671
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,240
somehow the Oracle of here's everything

672
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,220
that he said yeah if we just do this and

673
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,980
this and this because it's so complex I

674
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,360
don't even know all of the things that

675
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,860
go on anymore everything that happened

676
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,880
at registration this year I I don't know

677
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,380
um everything how those communities got

678
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,059
set up other than hanging the banners

679
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,280
which are pretty cool by the way other

680
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,260
than hanging the banners I don't know

681
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,740
you know so all that stuff happens by

682
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,240
volunteer effort and it takes people a

683
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,159
lot of time attendee bags badges we

684
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,020
talked about mini badge design some of

685
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,640
these things take a lot of time and

686
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,919
energy and

687
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,900
create Logistics problems and everything

688
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,760
else and so if you are interested and

689
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,900
maybe this is the slide where I'm

690
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,059
supposed to land and say hey if you are

691
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,100
interested in contributing to the youth

692
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,080
or the saint con conference in some sort

693
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,299
of meaningful way these are our biggest

694
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,640
needs these aren't all of our needs but

695
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,620
these are our biggest needs we need

696
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,360
Graphics designers

697
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,940
I spend literally I'm just going to

698
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,980
throw this out there I mean it's a guess

699
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,159
of a number but probably

700
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,860
two to three hundred hours

701
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,200
building Graphics designed for this

702
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,240
conference every single year most of the

703
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,580
graphics that you see on signage on your

704
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,500
mini Badges and other things are

705
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,120
something that I've designed either last

706
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,400
year this year or whatever the logo

707
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,380
designs and everything else and that

708
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,419
takes a lot of my time

709
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,580
tons and tons of it I could totally use

710
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,440
some help so if you're a graphics

711
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,539
designer or no one that's really good

712
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,140
and that is volunteer effort or is

713
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,880
willing to volunteer I'm interested in

714
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,799
that one web content developers and

715
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,779
managers we do a really good job with

716
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,299
our website but we struggle with that so

717
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,400
if you're able or willing to volunteer

718
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,220
and help keep our con web content up to

719
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,440
date and things that's one area many

720
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,559
badge designers we've probably seated in

721
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,740
fact we coined the phrase at our

722
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,480
committee we call it poolcon where we go

723
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,740
sit around the pool and just talk about

724
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,020
how the conference is going

725
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,179
um but we talk we we coined the phrase

726
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,400
we have poked the mini badge bear this

727
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,419
year

728
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,460
and we know we have

729
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,559
meaning that even though there are

730
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,419
probably only a hundred mini badges that

731
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,100
were unique to the conference this year

732
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,840
okay and maybe I've heard rumors of up

733
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,120
to 200 or whatever if we think that

734
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,159
that's the threshold how many of you are

735
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,020
are planning on going back and designing

736
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,880
your own mini badge for next year

737
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,440
that you didn't have one this year right

738
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,260
like yeah it's going to be off the hook

739
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,659
next year for many badges

740
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,900
just saying many badge designers hey we

741
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,460
can probably use you and those of you

742
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,020
that have been inspired to maybe go and

743
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,659
learn that new skill we might have a

744
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,039
community badge that you could design

745
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,260
next year because that's a ton of my

746
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,940
time that I spend on that as well

747
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,640
hackers challenged uh puzzle designers

748
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
we're always looking for good ideas

749
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,559
um Josh Galvez he's over there talking

750
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,900
about hackers challenge right now but

751
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,940
the interesting thing about this is you

752
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,000
can't run a challenge or a contest like

753
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,140
that for as many years and keep just

754
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,960
coming up with fresh ideas you run out

755
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,539
of ideas at a certain point I know

756
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,820
because I ran out of ideas before it got

757
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,299
handed off to Josh Galvez

758
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,980
um and so he's getting to that point and

759
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,140
he's indicated it and very respectfully

760
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,700
like I don't know if I can think new

761
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,220
things up and so ideas are what he needs

762
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,600
and so if you've got hackers challenge

763
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,880
puzzle ideas that's one way to work on

764
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,260
it so let's talk a little bit about

765
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,600
Saint Khan and the future

766
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,080
okay we're likely I'm going to drop this

767
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
right here so that you are all unfair

768
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,500
warning

769
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,779
we are likely not going to continue to

770
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:04,940
let Saint con grow in size Dave

771
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
I'll get to that there's a slide for

772
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,159
that

773
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,820
okay so Saint Khan is likely we're not

774
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,260
going to let it continue to grow in size

775
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,539
we think that with the volunteer effort

776
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,580
that we have and without having to go

777
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,320
hire people for the Utah Saint

778
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,900
organization to manage books and all of

779
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,419
these other things that the 1500 Mark is

780
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,640
about what we think we can hold plus it

781
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,559
fits well in the conference venue you're

782
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,600
you're not bumping into the shoulders

783
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,460
and things but there's a lot of people

784
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,520
around too so anyways I just want to put

785
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,799
you on notice 1500 may be the number the

786
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,240
maximum number for the foreseeable

787
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,220
future doesn't mean that we won't make a

788
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,140
decision later to hey you know what I

789
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,520
think we've got this figured out we can

790
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,760
take on 300 more but for next year don't

791
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,740
anticipate growth in the conference this

792
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,900
will be the first time

793
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,140
ever that we have capped at the same

794
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,179
level as the year before on conference

795
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,000
registrations now this also needs our

796
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,559
Board of Trustees to weigh in on this

797
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,240
this is not an executive decision that's

798
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,980
being made right this moment but I want

799
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,840
you to be on notice that Saint Khan will

800
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,400
sell out quickly

801
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,080
in the future and so when we start

802
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
sending out those notices like hey it's

803
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,380
time to register you're probably going

804
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,000
to have a week

805
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,299
maybe because it's sold out in a month

806
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,820
this year which we've never seen that

807
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,779
kind of

808
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,600
um that kind of demand before anyways a

809
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,159
couple of other things costs for Saint

810
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,799
con will remain low in fact we are

811
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,080
considering lowering the cost of Saint

812
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,120
con for next year again the Board of

813
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,620
Trustees need to weigh in on this and

814
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,480
everything else because Saint Khan is

815
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,880
not about making money this conference

816
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,580
is a cost recovery con meaning that the

817
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,140
majority of the money that we bring in

818
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,140
pays for the venue pays for the food

819
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,779
pays for the free sodas pays for all the

820
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,500
mini Badges and all the other things

821
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,380
and so what we plan on at this point is

822
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,659
a break-even point this last year or

823
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,059
this year at about 1100 attendees

824
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,220
meaning that we needed to have 1100

825
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,220
attendees in the room or registered for

826
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,840
us to not have

827
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,360
that come out of my savings account or

828
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,640
somebody else's savings account which

829
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,440
has happened in years before or in years

830
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,179
past by the way but

831
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,220
um that we had to have 1100 but when we

832
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,640
sold from 1100 to 1500

833
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,200
now we have a little bit of extra money

834
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,240
in in that bank and so what we think is

835
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,700
if we're going to hit that 1500 Mark our

836
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,500
break even Mark will probably be

837
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,100
calculated at 1400 attendees ish meaning

838
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,480
that we could probably drop the price

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,279
back down because again we're not here

840
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,440
to make money on this conference at all

841
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,779
and we think it's very reasonable for

842
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,460
four days of content and coming out and

843
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,779
hanging out and networking and getting

844
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,240
about 50 000 mini Badges and and

845
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,480
everything else although the CL the cost

846
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,580
will likely follow any inflation curve

847
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,960
because we're all kind of worried and

848
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,360
seeing that kind of craziness and so

849
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,679
just be prepared I don't want to say

850
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,539
yeah well he said 250 in that

851
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,539
presentation so but now he wants 300

852
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,820
well if the dollar's worth less and I've

853
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,919
still got to buy many badges we're going

854
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,059
to want to have mini batches right

855
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,460
anyway so just understand that that's

856
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,200
our mission as well we're not here to

857
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,520
try and make money off of this

858
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,640
conference at all in fact in our we only

859
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,799
bank or put I mean this is full

860
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,380
disclosure like if you want to know

861
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,480
every single year for several years we

862
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,240
would only take in about five to ten

863
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,500
thousand dollars extra buffer each year

864
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,360
and it took us a really long time to

865
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,159
save up about seventy thousand dollars

866
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,220
to put in the bank before 2020 hit and

867
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,620
we did a virtual con for free and we

868
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,059
basically blew through that entire

869
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,820
budget or most of it and so we're just

870
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,039
kind of recouping Our intention just

871
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,720
again for full disclosure for those of

872
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,500
you that are interested in the

873
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,419
governance of the organization is to

874
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,860
keep about a hundred thousand dollar

875
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,520
Reserve meaning that we can

876
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,500
pre-pay for badge costs and other things

877
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,600
that have to happen before registration

878
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,220
opens and some of these other things

879
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,679
that also covers the administrative

880
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,659
costs for the organization okay we have

881
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,419
storage costs uh we have to file we have

882
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,440
to pay attorneys we have to pay CPAs and

883
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,299
and bookkeepers and other things like

884
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,399
this for some of the some of these

885
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,679
services to make this easier and so we

886
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,760
do have some of those administrative

887
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,320
accounts that's what those go to there's

888
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,520
full disclosure if you want more detail

889
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,620
well come ask me we are

890
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,580
which year

891
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,659
okay

892
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,059
I I can generalize it so to run this

893
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,520
this conference it'll end up costing the

894
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,380
Utah Saint organization probably

895
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,700
somewhere around three hundred and

896
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,460
twenty thousand dollars

897
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,779
and we took in approximately 348 000 in

898
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,480
registration and and other Revenue if

899
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,940
that's there there you go I mean that

900
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,799
I'm I'm throwing out generalized numbers

901
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,020
if you want specifics we are very

902
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,240
transparent in our finances as an

903
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,100
organization as well and you're welcome

904
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,840
to come up and say hey I want to see it

905
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,500
so that's fine okay bigger and broader

906
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,779
content we think that because of all the

907
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,580
buzz that surrounded Saint Khan and

908
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,279
other things we're becoming uh we're

909
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,080
we're a security conference that's on

910
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,640
the map now how many of you are from out

911
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,059
of state that are still here right okay

912
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:22,559
anyway and keep your hands up for just a

913
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,940
second I wanna I wanted to do this an

914
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,279
opening ceremonies and I forgot if

915
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,720
you're from Idaho put your hands down

916
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,279
because we kind of adopt the idahoans

917
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,860
right okay

918
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,860
but but still I I would be interested in

919
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,600
hearing in fact I could probably look in

920
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,860
the registration system there's so

921
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,659
little data that we collect because of

922
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,760
privacy reasons but we do want to know

923
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,620
some of that information so there's very

924
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,179
little data we have I'm going to go look

925
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,620
through I didn't have an opportunity to

926
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,620
see but it's becoming more noticed

927
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,440
saintcon is now talked about at Defcon

928
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,419
and at schmoocon and other these other

929
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:58,799
things so when we're talking about

930
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,419
registration selling out quickly in the

931
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,120
future there's a lot of external demand

932
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,559
that if they just knew what we were

933
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,480
doing here in Utah they're going to be

934
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
the ones competing for these tickets and

935
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,960
so one of the challenges that we'll

936
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,879
we'll talk about later or figure out is

937
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,139
how to make sure that our local

938
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,599
community has the first chance at

939
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,580
tickets Seth right here one of our

940
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,399
membership and the registrations are for

941
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,139
the Utah State organization has a

942
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,379
comment

943
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,199
14 of the people here are from out of

944
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,460
state according to the registration

945
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,440
system anyways

946
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,060
we're growing in reputation and

947
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,440
everything else I think that's a good

948
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,899
thing it's attracting some good content

949
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,599
like all of a sudden the the presenters

950
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,339
that were like what the heck is sync on

951
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,899
it I don't want to come present there

952
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,060
we're getting some really high quality

953
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,280
presenters and and people interested in

954
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
participating here so anyways that's one

955
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,179
of the good problems to have and so

956
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,739
we're going to continue to grow in that

957
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,179
in that area as well

958
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,859
this answers your question Dave here's

959
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,900
how to get involved if you are

960
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,460
interested interested in getting

961
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,520
involved in Saint Con in January we have

962
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
what we have what we call a call for

963
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,320
committee and this is where we seat a

964
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,180
committee a conference planning

965
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,760
committee uh that is responsible for all

966
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,200
aspects of the conference and its

967
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,220
functions

968
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,160
and so what we do currently is we kind

969
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,839
of do an attrition-based thing meaning

970
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,300
that if a committee member has not burnt

971
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,820
the candle at both ends enough yet

972
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,119
that they can continue to be in the role

973
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,980
and responsibility within in that

974
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,740
committee year over year until we either

975
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,540
kick them out or they're like I'm done

976
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,760
and the I'm done thing happens from time

977
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,440
to time and it's not never a negative

978
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
thing it's just some people are like I

979
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,880
need to take a break and a year off so

980
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,920
that happens in January and so what

981
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
happens generally is to the Utah Saint

982
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,180
list uh in the Saint con Discord and

983
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,800
other places you're going to hear about

984
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,560
open committee positions uh in in

985
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,720
January and we hope to have those seated

986
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
by the end of January because by the

987
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,060
time February and March open up we have

988
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,980
a committee Retreat where we get all

989
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,839
those folks together and we start

990
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,460
planning the conference we plan the

991
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,500
structure we plan the how are we going

992
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,820
to do these things or what are we going

993
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,859
to do in these areas and it kind of goes

994
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,440
through that process and then by the

995
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,780
time that's done as early as April and

996
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,180
May we have a call for contests

997
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,920
communities and events those are three

998
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,260
separate items but this is how you can

999
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,540
get involved in Saint on and probably

1000
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,400
the most meaningful way if you don't

1001
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
have six months of your life to give

1002
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,420
away okay so six months of your life up

1003
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,040
here

1004
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,780
two or three months of your life right

1005
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,160
here

1006
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,099
maybe maybe three or four weeks of prep

1007
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,960
time and life here and down here you

1008
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,000
give a week of your life at the con kind

1009
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
of thing just helping you understand the

1010
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,200
levels here of commitment uh and we'll

1011
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
sell it on it's like a timeshare we'll

1012
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,660
get you we'll get you sold

1013
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,160
um but contest community events these

1014
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,339
are our staff members uh and they fall

1015
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,540
underneath of one of the committee

1016
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,839
members's roles and responsibilities and

1017
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,339
these are the ones that are putting

1018
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,500
together the app set community and the

1019
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,359
RFID Community these are all again

1020
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,880
volunteers that are coming and spending

1021
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,680
three months of hey I gotta go out and

1022
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,720
procure all this stuff and hey can you

1023
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,000
help me find this and man wouldn't it be

1024
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,339
cool if man that question is so

1025
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,780
dangerous sometimes wouldn't it be cool

1026
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,619
if

1027
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,500
right and so call for contest

1028
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,760
communities events happen sometime in

1029
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,200
the April May time frame depending on

1030
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,119
how ready we are for for it as a

1031
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,859
committee call for presenters generally

1032
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,900
opens in the May time frame and again I

1033
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,060
put approximates here because it changes

1034
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,760
based off of where we are in our

1035
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,280
processes and things our deadline for

1036
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,140
all of these things is generally we have

1037
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,119
to know by the time registration opens

1038
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,820
who's volunteering so that we can give

1039
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,200
them the codes that they need to

1040
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,660
register because one of the things that

1041
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,400
costs us so much money every single year

1042
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,000
is somebody will pay for the conference

1043
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,220
and

1044
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,520
they want to volunteer but they haven't

1045
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
heard back from us yet whether they're

1046
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,720
going to be a volunteer or a speaker or

1047
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,640
you know or something else and then they

1048
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,260
get awarded that and we have to refund

1049
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,000
that our refund costs on our

1050
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,240
registration transaction system is 15 a

1051
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,320
ticket

1052
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,000
so it costs us quite a bit of money when

1053
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,700
we do that so our goal is to get all

1054
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,320
that stuff done before we open up

1055
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,599
registration in July so that helps you

1056
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,579
with the time frame here anyways call

1057
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,740
for presenters in May call for

1058
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,160
volunteers happens in June this is the

1059
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,780
if you want to come and just get

1060
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,880
involved and just help in some general

1061
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,460
area that's probably the easiest best

1062
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,160
and and nicest way to get involved is

1063
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,440
come volunteer for us and get a feel for

1064
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,599
it and then maybe it gets you get it

1065
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,640
kind of stirs the bug in you to come

1066
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
back and be a staff member in one of the

1067
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,119
communities or contests or something

1068
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,820
else or I mean down here these are a

1069
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,260
little bit more just

1070
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,540
you know generalized things we have a

1071
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,579
just call for great people one of the

1072
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,920
one of the things that is is super

1073
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,380
interesting about Saint Khan is most of

1074
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,180
the people in what we would call a

1075
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,740
leadership position at the conference

1076
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,540
these aren't people that went through

1077
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,460
some strong vetting process or anything

1078
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,320
else these are literally the people that

1079
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
came in and said hey I'll do that for

1080
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,720
you and it just kind of morphed into

1081
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,880
okay well can you do this too oh yeah

1082
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,520
sure and we just suck people's lives

1083
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,740
away that way I mean it's a real thing

1084
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,260
but we're looking for great people if

1085
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,599
you are interested and you want to to be

1086
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,160
involved in the conference you don't

1087
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,380
have to necessarily follow these

1088
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,820
processes exactly in fact these

1089
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,560
processes are kind of

1090
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,440
arbitrary you know to some degree

1091
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,780
volunteers not so much we we want

1092
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,640
structure there because there's almost

1093
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,160
200 of of you out there we also have a

1094
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,200
call for diversity we think that we need

1095
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,680
more diverse opinions and ideas inside

1096
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,859
of our conference planning okay I think

1097
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,119
that that's critical I think that's

1098
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,740
critical in our just our industry in

1099
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,540
general not just on planning committee

1100
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,700
and everything else and we also need to

1101
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,740
call for connected people if somebody

1102
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,020
knows how to get a hold of Mark Rober

1103
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,099
we have been trying to get that guy to

1104
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,859
come keynote for us for years

1105
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,540
and we just can't get the right contacts

1106
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,540
we can't find hey here's how to get get

1107
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,760
we think that Mark would come up here

1108
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,460
and do an amazing job and probably have

1109
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,380
content for all of his YouTube videos

1110
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,680
for a month just experiencing what we do

1111
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,660
at this conference right

1112
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,520
but something like that

1113
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,820
if anybody knows Mark let's let's read

1114
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,079
do you know or

1115
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,700
okay I am not necessary

1116
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm not necessarily advocating that we

1117
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,320
spam him

1118
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,900
uh and thinks

1119
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,880
but we would love to have somebody with

1120
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,520
that kind of Charisma that kind of

1121
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,200
influence and other things come and talk

1122
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,760
to us about the cool things that he's

1123
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,640
doing and maybe use the opportunity to

1124
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,619
help him understand there's this whole

1125
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,180
other side of things other than building

1126
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,880
stuff that that that is right up his

1127
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,980
alley right anyways he's one of many

1128
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,839
people that we're seeking but if you are

1129
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,520
connected to people that are movers

1130
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,300
shakers and and and would fit well into

1131
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,859
a community our community is either

1132
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,079

1146
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,500
was kind of a meme for him it's like I

1147
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,940
wanted to let him look like wait you

1148
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,839
just told me you weren't going to

1149
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,820
publish him and he has his reasons and

1150
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,079
everything else but here's the reason

1151
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,839
why we don't publish our dates at the

1152
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,060
close of one con before the next one is

1153
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,800
that until we have a conference planning

1154
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,880
committee that we know is going to be

1155
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,440
able to pull off the con

1156
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,940
I'm not going to sign a 300 000 contract

1157
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,859
uh when I only have a hundred thousand

1158
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,720
dollars in the bank

1159
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,359
for the next year and so when we have

1160
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:26,280
that taken care of we generally sign and

1161
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,320
contract in the uh March April time

1162
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,380
frame uh with the venue here uh and and

1163
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,760
start entering into some of the other

1164
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,020
contracts that we have at about that

1165
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,320
time so watch for our save the date

1166
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,619
announcements sometime early next year

1167
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,060
um after we get the next committee

1168
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,040
formed okay then just a little side note

1169
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,079
this is the add part of me if you are

1170
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,180
interested in one of the most incredible

1171
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,280
book series that I've ever

1172
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,520
trust the awesome this is my favorite

1173
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,800
book series and if you're a geek like me

1174
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,819
you will love this in fact I highly

1175
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,980
highly highly recommend that you listen

1176
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,660
to this on Audible by the reader RC Bray

1177
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,940
he does all of the voices

1178
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,319
and this will Amaze you okay but here's

1179
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,900
the caveat you have to promise me that

1180
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,640
even though the book is sort of

1181
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,200
interesting but not super interesting

1182
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,859
for the first half of the first book

1183
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,380
you have to promise that you will get to

1184
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,579
the part

1185
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,079
where you meet Skippy

1186
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,180
if you can get to the part where you

1187
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,960
meet Skippy you are going on a 13 book

1188
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,800
Adventure

1189
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,000
and it yes

1190
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,380
yeah so here's another testimonial up

1191
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,540
here I'm sure this is my favorite book

1192
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,880
uh series of all time well not maybe of

1193
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,040
all time I still I'm really akin to like

1194
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,920
the Ready Player One original not that

1195
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,440
too junk or whatever anyways I digress

1196
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,300
if you're looking for a good audible

1197
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,980
book to read to listen to on the way

1198
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,740
home this one's the one okay

1199
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,040
all right it's time now for Q a I'll

1200
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,500
take any generalized questions I don't

1201
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,119
promise to give you all of the detailed

1202
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,819
answers how are we on time so we've got

1203
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,380
about 10 to 15 minutes before they're

1204
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,520
going to start tearing the walls down

1205
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,839
and everything else but go ahead right

1206
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,020
here

1207
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,220
okay great question registration for

1208
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,380
Saint con typically opens up sometime

1209
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,440
between the 4th of July and the 15th of

1210
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,319
July in that window but what we will do

1211
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,420
is by the time we get to the point where

1212
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,920
we're going to open up registration it

1213
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,960
won't be ambiguous we will say it'll

1214
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,240
open on X date and it'll be on our

1215
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,680
website we don't try and hide it from

1216
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,940
you like oh we're just going to pop it

1217
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,160
up that's not how it happens

1218
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,680
but good question so July first part of

1219
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,980
July

1220
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,740
I think that maybe it used to kind of

1221
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,040
tie to it but the the reason why it

1222
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,280
lands where it does uh in a lot of in a

1223
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,660
lot of ways is a little bit traditional

1224
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,160
and has to do with education meaning

1225
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,680
that a lot of the Educators and folks

1226
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,140
when you're starting up school

1227
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,839
and it's August September man for I.T

1228
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,780
folks in education it's a heavy lift to

1229
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,520
get all those Chromebooks out and all

1230
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,839
those other things and so we always

1231
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,960
bumped it a little bit further so that

1232
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,420
by the time Saint con would happen that

1233
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,560
these guys aren't just completely

1234
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,060
inundated with stuff and so that's where

1235
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,040
the tradition came from but that's not

1236
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,900
necessarily the main driver anymore this

1237
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,079
is just it's become the that's the year

1238
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,420
away in the part now and to move it to

1239
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,880
something like March like there's no

1240
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,579
there is no way that we could move it in

1241
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,960
fact my wife's got a great story about

1242
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,339
how we moved it to March one year

1243
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,760
right and and we've heard that before

1244
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,099
and so what we try and do is avoid the

1245
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,460
fall break week when we can but

1246
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,500
sometimes we're limited to hey this is

1247
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,599
when the venue has the the options and

1248
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,339
things so but a good question but that

1249
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,200
is where that comes from and I don't

1250
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,880
anticipate Ever Changing we need 12

1251
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,800
months we need that break for a little

1252
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,839
bit I need to not think about Saint con

1253
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:21,960
for three or four months

1254
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,760
and if we were to start planning

1255
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,319
something in March or something there's

1256
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:28,880
no way we would all die go ahead

1257
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,400
okay so the question is what about venue

1258
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,200
and is it going to be here for the

1259
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,260
foreseeable future and we think yes

1260
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,839
the Utah Valley Convention Center is the

1261
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,280
right size for us it is the right

1262
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,079
um I don't know it's got all of the

1263
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,000
things that we've grown into and need

1264
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,099
the only other option for us at this

1265
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,420
point would be to move it to something

1266
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,400
like the Salt Palace

1267
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,839
and

1268
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,960
as much as we would love to get it into

1269
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,119
the Salt Lake Valley because that makes

1270
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,920
it so our Keynotes and all these people

1271
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,240
that we're bringing in from out of town

1272
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,980
don't have to get off the plane and be

1273
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,300
like

1274
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,300
I gotta drive for an hour

1275
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,920
because that happens

1276
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,260
we would love to get to Salt Lake but I

1277
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,060
I'm just not a huge fan of the Salt

1278
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,400
Palace for I mean if we were had a 30

1279
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,380
000 person event yeah let's fill the

1280
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,079
place but uh I don't know it feels empty

1281
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,240
to me when you have even a group this

1282
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,900
large in that gigantic event and so the

1283
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,859
only other option that we've had

1284
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,359
available to us has been the Mountain

1285
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,640
America Expo Center or what used to be

1286
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,220
called South Town Expo and such but

1287
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,099
we've been in so many events there and

1288
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,040
the Acoustics in their Expo floor for

1289
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,980
talks and other things is just awful and

1290
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,660
so we we just don't think that that's a

1291
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,640
viable option so for the foreseeable

1292
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,200
future to answer your question directly

1293
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,260
we plan on being here at the Utah Valley

1294
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,359
Convention Center so where we apologize

1295
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,819
profusely if that is inconvenient for

1296
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:00,119
you but it the one of the other things

1297
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,680
and if Danny's somehow in the room I

1298
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,839
don't know if he is

1299
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,980
this place they work with us so well

1300
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,560
they they are they are so accommodating

1301
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,660
they are so understanding about the

1302
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,700
weirdness that we bring

1303
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,940
the dumb weird things that we do uh and

1304
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,380
everything else and so we couldn't be

1305
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,240
more honored to have them as a partner I

1306
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,859
mean we consider them a partner here we

1307
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,859
do pay them money uh to to be here and

1308
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,380
appropriately so like it's not free to

1309
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,359
power what your guys are doing down in

1310
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,400
home Labs like I don't know what you're

1311
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,660
doing down there

1312
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,780
but uh you know it's not free but a

1313
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,520
great question we will be here uh for

1314
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,440
the foreseeable future we know there's

1315
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,300
at least one more Saint con to happen

1316
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm not trying to scare anybody but we

1317
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,560
only plan one year in advance and so

1318
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,180
don't anticipate that this is a 10-year

1319
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,740
thing because there might be a point

1320
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,500
where my candle at both ends is burnt

1321
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,480
and you know somebody else is gonna have

1322
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,680
to take it so if you're ready to take

1323
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,579
that

1324
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,380
come see me after I'll give you a Yoda

1325
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,680
badge

1326
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,420
and it's yours you know kind of thing

1327
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,980
anyways was there another question or

1328
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,880
comment go right here

1329
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,040
okay great question so we talked about

1330
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,420
the call for volunteers and everything

1331
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,819
else how's that disseminated our website

1332
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,920
and Twitter feed are our only two

1333
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,500
official communication mechanisms and so

1334
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,480
if you are subscribed to us on or you're

1335
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,920
following us on Twitter you'll get those

1336
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,140
alerts or you're going to need to visit

1337
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,300
our website periodically and the call

1338
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,280
for volunteers will be on the main front

1339
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,680
page you won't miss it that's where it

1340
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,060
happens

1341
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,700
what's that Discord two like there's if

1342
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,040
you're in the Saint Khan Discord you're

1343
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,380
going to hear about it for sure

1344
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,780
so anything else in the back red shirt

1345
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,240
okay that's a great question and it's a

1346
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,980
trade secret

1347
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,140
actually no it's not it's really not

1348
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,420
those LED filaments they're cool huh

1349
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,560
right

1350
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,480
when I saw that for the first time I

1351
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,040
thought yeah I immediately thought

1352
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,500
lightsaber mini badge there we go we got

1353
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,640
it

1354
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,859
um and so very honestly I got them off

1355
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,260
AliExpress they were super cheap

1356
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,619
which is why I was able to make 250 to

1357
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,680
300 of them for you guys to all have

1358
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,839
um and make sure you get the 3.3 volt

1359
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,520
ones because they make other voltages

1360
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,339
that we don't facilitate on this badge

1361
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:24,240
so

1362
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,859
but yeah they're they're pretty

1363
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,960
inexpensive overall so build your I

1364
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,619
expect to see one or two

1365
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:33,359
non-troy non-jupiter created uh

1366
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,220
lightsaber mini badges next year as a

1367
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,859

1368
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:40,079

1369

middle of this thing and it's not not a

1384
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:18,119
big deal we're just going to start

1385
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,740
opening up

1386
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,140
um family night one of the things

1387
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,420
whether it's cultural to us here in Utah

1388
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,520
being very family oriented or anything

1389
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,960
else

1390
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,660
um or whether it's just I love

1391
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,280
personally

1392
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,520
seen a kid have that aha moment

1393
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,200
to where you know you've just broken

1394
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,079
their brain and you've really and

1395
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,900
they've realized that I can do some I

1396
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,540
can pick a lock I'm five years old and I

1397
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,480
can pick a lock now my kids have all had

1398
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,460
that aha experience and I've seen how

1399
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,800
it's changed their lives and how it's

1400
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,839
changed mine because when the the

1401
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,520
principal from the school calls and says

1402
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,960
hey your son's tried to pick all the

1403
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,059
locks

1404
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,460
on all the bicycles outside kind of

1405
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,800
thing true story

1406
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
um

1407
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,619
true story but I love seeing that aha

1408
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,540
moment and so it just makes sense uh the

1409
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,480
family night event is actually

1410
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,680
administered by the the saint Khan

1411
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,440

1412
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,240

1415
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,040
