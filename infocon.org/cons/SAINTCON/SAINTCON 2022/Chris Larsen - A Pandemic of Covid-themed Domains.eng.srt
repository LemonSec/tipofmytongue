1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,580
so I'm a researcher in the web threat

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,040
space with Symantec been through several

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,660
corporate mergers so now we're part of

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,740
broadcom

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,920
which is not relevant to anything

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,760
um

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,139
so

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,719
in thinking about how fun it was to be

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,000
coming back to Saint Khan after the

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,180
pandemic that kind of gave me the idea

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,800
for the talk it's like well there was

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,260
some interesting stuff going on in the

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080
early days of the pandemic in the web

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
threat space right

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
specifically you know if you if you go

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,860
back in time I was at RSA

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,460
late February of 2020 and

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,280
um we already had you know a health

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,360
emergency

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,700
it had not yet been declared a global

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,340
pandemic by who that was a couple weeks

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,180
later

23
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,520
some big companies though already pulled

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,219
out I think a t not to like name names

25
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,440
or anything but like I think at T was

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,640
one where

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,820
instead of a big booth on the show floor

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,760
they just had an open space

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,420
um

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,700
and there were several Open Spaces among

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,260
the big sponsors

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,340
there were Asia for example is is much

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,140
more used to dealing with respiratory

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,780
viruses in in outbreaks and so there

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,280
were a lot of people

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
in China that were already canceling

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,799
travel and other Asian countries

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,119
um

39
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,280
other conferences had canceled already

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
we'd already seen conferences be

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
canceled RSA chose to go ahead and got

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,560
some Flack for it

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,840
was interesting thinking back there were

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,780
hand sanitizer dispenser machines at the

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
escalators that didn't see many masks

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
though

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,060
um San Francisco had declared an

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,640
emergency but still let it go ahead they

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
basically those shut down right after

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,500
that the next week everything was like

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,579
shutting down

52
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,799
and it was early enough in the in the

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,659
pandemic where like we just didn't know

54
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,119
how infectious or scary this should be

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,439
and so

56
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,000
I included the the news archive there

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,100
where it was early enough that boy if

58
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,038
out of say 20 000 people there yes there

59
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,500
were two confirmed cases that were at

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,379
RSA right and not to make light of this

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,780
because one of the exabeam engineers was

62
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,340
a middle-aged guy that was in the

63
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,959
hospital in critical care if I remember

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,000
and I honestly don't remember if he

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
pulled through or not right so but you

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,680
found yourself saying oh did I go buy

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
the exabeam booth you know could I have

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,400
been in close proximity with one of

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,300
those people

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,879
and you contrast that with months later

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
it's like oh yeah like my family's had

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
it you know I know everybody's had it

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
you know it's like it's everywhere and

74
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,560
it's all so you wouldn't see a a big

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,540
news item like that

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
months later right but this is like the

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,220
early days of the pandemic well

78
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,920
that was human land right real life in

79
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
in domain land where I live things are

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
also getting crazy so in

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,000
early March so I grabbed I've got

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,280
several different researchers and

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,300
vendors

84
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,099
um slides to pull from just to say this

85
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,019
is not like me saying so this is how it

86
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,780
was okay so checkpoint had an article

87
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,819
and they said

88
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,300
um we've got over 4 000

89
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,560
coronavirus related domains registered

90
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,599
globally since January this is this is

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,700
March 5th okay so it's the week after

92
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,980
RSA

93
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,260
um so three percent of those websites

94
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,580
are malicious

95
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,459
that's 50 more likely than other domains

96
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,560
registered so I can do the math so so

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,500
two percent of newly registered domains

98
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,659
are malicious but three percent

99
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,780
of the coronavirus that's 50 more right

100
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,519
so that's marketing speak I don't like

101
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,140
Mark this is not the call checkpoint out

102
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,959
because like every vendor including mine

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,299
has marketing people that like try to

104
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,860
make things sound scarier so they can

105
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,220
sell more stuff I hate that

106
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,040
um so this is if you can't read this is

107
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,940
ftc.gov so this is a government

108
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,299
publication focusing on specifically it

109
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,400
says on how attackers exploit public

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
fear through phishing so hey

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,620
the attackers are starting to do fishing

112
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,560
campaigns themed around coronavirus and

113
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
covet

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,799
and so they track you know the number of

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,900
domains that are they think are Corona

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,299
related based on the domain name both in

117
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,660
domain names and in TLS certs that are

118
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,978
registered right and like almost

119
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,040
everything has a TLS cert these days

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
um

121
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
and so that looks scary and this is a

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
government publication saying hey

123
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
there's a lot of fishing going on so we

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,500
should worry about it so there are lots

125
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,600
of people worrying about it

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,139
um this is now a little later this is

127
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,940
um mid-april

128
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,820
it was an update of sofos

129
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,560
um that they've done an article in March

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
as well they'd updated it so this I

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,120
think is more reflective of what life

132
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,340
was like than checkpoint had

133
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,720
where

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
sofa says we're seeing like 3 000 new

135
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,479
domain registrations every day and over

136
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,440
35

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,540
000 so far

138
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,139
um

139
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,180
and so

140
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,780
you know that's my favorite picture of

141
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,360
how bad and how quickly bad things were

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,460
getting but and we'll come back by the

143
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,259
end of the talk you know to like how bad

144
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,060
actually was it okay that's I'm saving

145
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,979
that for the end

146
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,620
um but the the point of this talk comes

147
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,800
from a little thing in that other sofas

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,380
article where

149
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,139
um they mentioned that their Chief

150
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,780
scientist had launched a slack Channel

151
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,940
and I already knew about that because I

152
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,919
was in the slack channel so I've got a

153
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,259
colleague former colleague I guess I

154
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,139
mean still friend Spike had reached out

155
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,539
early in that that March time frame to

156
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,000
say hey we're getting slammed with

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,460
Corona and covet type domains and

158
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,740
everybody's saying hey these are bad and

159
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,600
they're they can't all be bad but we

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,120
need help sorting out the good from the

161
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
bad right and you guys are good at that

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
and so do you want to come aboard and

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
help and so yeah sure like this is a

164
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
this is a global crisis

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,320
you know domain man to the rescue and

166
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,639
um I'm fortunate enough that I have

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
enough seniority that at the drop of a

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,320
hat basically I can say yeah I'm going

169
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,300
to focus on this now this is a cool

170
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,320
problem

171
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,060
and it is a problem so I'm going to help

172
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,699
and I grab one of our senior threat

173
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,979
analysts who also is likes this stuff

174
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,960
and hey let's help do this so we jumped

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,139
in and so what this was was the Cyber

176
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,060
threat Coalition this is not to be

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,680
confused with these cyber threat

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Alliance

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
which already existed at that time

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
and that's a set of vendors including

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,259
Symantec and topos and others who share

182
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,979
threat intelligence with each other

183
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,660
prior to the release so when there's a

184
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,460
blog or something that comes out and

185
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
someone's announcing a scary new attack

186
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,620
the members of the CTA have already seen

187
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,840
that and had a chance to update their

188
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,360
products you know with whatever threat

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
indicators are in there whether it's a

190
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,660
file hash or a domain or an IP stuff

191
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,680
like that

192
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,020
and that's working that works well

193
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,120
um I don't know how much publicity I

194
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,199
guess I don't know how many people out

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,180
there are generally aware of the CTA but

196
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,819
they do good work so the Cyber threat

197
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,400
Coalition though was different this was

198
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,979
a slack Channel and it was open

199
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,900
invitation to anybody that wants to come

200
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,360
help help solve the problem

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,160
and so this is what the website looked

202
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,520
like back in 2020

203
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,919
and you can't read all of that but one

204
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,860
of the things it's offering is is a

205
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,360
vetted block list

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,639
okay so there's two lists but by now

207
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,819
right there's well over 30 40 50

208
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,120
000 covid Corona type domain names out

209
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,840
there

210
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
and

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,919
with enough people looking at the

212
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,259
problem almost every one of those

213
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,240
domains will have somebody saying that

214
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,380
it's bad

215
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,240
or that it's suspicious

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
and so the trick is like arriving at

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,300
some kind of consensus and so the CTC

218
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,720
provided both the open list like these

219
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,460
are everything that anybody has sent in

220
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,500
and said might be Shady

221
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
this is our vetted block list and so the

222
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,199
my my buddy and I

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,020
and Spike we were focused on how do you

224
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,080
go from a big list of 30 or 40 000

225
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,280
things

226
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,020
that's getting several thousand more

227
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,319
things a day that might be Shady down to

228
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,840
a list that's reasonable to give to the

229
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
the cowering public to put onto their

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,940
their web filters and firewalls and

231
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,320
stuff

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
um so that's what the Cyber threat

233
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,059
Coalition looked like in 2020

234
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,580
this is what it looks like today

235
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,459
a moment of silence for the CTC it it

236
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,700
did its job and has uh and then gone to

237
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,500
sleep

238
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,240
um so it went very early from the

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,580
researchers involved telling their other

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,019
researcher friends hey do you want to

241
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,360
come help with this problem but the the

242
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,220
website meant you anybody's welcome to

243
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,420
join

244
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,399
all comers we'll find something for you

245
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,760
to do right and so

246
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
part of the talk is

247
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,779
how do you put together an ad hoc group

248
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,420
to tackle a threat space and and what

249
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,100
are the lessons you learn

250
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,500
so one good thing about if you get 3 000

251
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,800
people looking at that's probably I feel

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,060
pretty safe in saying that's probably

253
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,740
the more people that have ever cared

254
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,320
about domain reputation

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
in the history of the world wide web

256
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,240
I don't know if is my ear not big enough

257
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,140
now I got it backwards there we go

258
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,660
no

259
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,580
okay

260
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,320
so that's a lot of eyeballs on the

261
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
problem and that's also a lot of

262
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,140
different approaches in perspective

263
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,360
those are both good things about

264
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,100
something like this

265
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,839
there's also a lot of confusion as I

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,339
mentioned you take any one of the

267
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,560
domains that show up on the big list and

268
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,839
there's probably somebody in the

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,420
Coalition saying yeah that's shady

270
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,580
and so there's noise to sort through

271
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,339
this was also interesting because this

272
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,260
attracted some artificial intelligence

273
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,420
machine learning researchers who said

274
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,300
hey this looks like a job for ML right

275
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,459
we've got this big huge set of things

276
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,459
and we can use our super cool new AI

277
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,260
technique to sort through and figure out

278
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,580
the bad ones

279
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,700
and the problem is that

280
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,279
the vendors are already doing this okay

281
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,800
and if you come in new to the space

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,560
fresh from University and you've got the

283
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,660
machine learning background but you

284
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,120
don't have a background in actually

285
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,220
researching websites to decide if

286
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,079
they're Shady or not

287
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,959
how are you training your system okay

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,680
and so so I I tend to wonder right and

289
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,720
we saw problems in the output and so

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,700
because this is a hacker con we can be

291
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,320
snarky

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,920
um

293
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,540
just because you call something machine

294
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,800
learning doesn't mean it's doing

295
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,420
anything more sophisticated than pattern

296
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,920
matching okay

297
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,860
so over in Colorado there is a county

298
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,959
Coronado County

299
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,440
and its website is

300
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,680
Corona right it's evil this is one of

301
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
the ones that was flagged by one of the

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,740
machine learning systems that somebody

303
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,140
in the CTC said this is a this is a bad

304
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,100
domain

305
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,260
no it's not a bad domain it's just

306
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,519
accidentally

307
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,620
getting left in there was a guy named

308
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,500
Francisco and he's a video producer and

309
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,540
so his website is Francisco oh it's

310
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,180
covid ah right so he got on the list

311
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,120
there were a whole bunch of reputable

312
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,100
large organizations from governments

313
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,000
companies and orgs that created a covid

314
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,680
DOT subdomain

315
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,860
because they wanted a place to gather

316
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,500
what's happening with covet and us like

317
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,940
this could be a domain for their

318
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,920
employees to go to

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,380
to see what the current policies were or

320
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,060
how we're keeping our customers safe

321
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,920
right there's a lot of those

322
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
and so those tended to get flagged all

323
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,600
right and so these are the kinds of

324
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
problems you have to sort through

325
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
all right so now we get to the fun part

326
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
so how bad actually was the the malware

327
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,320
phishing Etc space so like how many of

328
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,820
these things were actually fishing so to

329
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,980
go back to the the one from the the

330
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,019
government the FTC

331
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,860
by April we easily had 40 000 of these

332
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
domains running around and if you

333
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,360
actually look at

334
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,640
the ones the number of unique domains

335
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,260
that were actually

336
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,899
confidently involved in fishing it's

337
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,720
less than 200. so 200 out of 40 000 is

338
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,660
half of one percent so no the vast

339
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,240
majority of the covid domains were not

340
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,480
doing phishing campaigns

341
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
um

342
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,300
so what was going on well there was lots

343
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,920
of scams there were a lot of scams going

344
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,700
on

345
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,760
um everything from for 29.99 you can buy

346
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,220
the secret military grade covid-19

347
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,380
Survival Man how does the military even

348
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,660
have a covid-19 survival manual when

349
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,579
it's brand new okay they don't spoiler

350
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,740
alert right but that was one of one of

351
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,360
the sites there were miracle cures and

352
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,120
we're not talking necessarily the

353
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,880
the

354
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,720
hydroxychloroquinine or the horse

355
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
dewormer dyvermectin stuff I mean those

356
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,079
at least had some

357
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,700
non-peer-reviewed study somewhere with a

358
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,560
few small people in questionable at

359
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,540
least one that said it might help right

360
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,399
and then people would Trump this is the

361
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,380
miracle drug no this is like these are

362
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,600
like herbal cures like secret Peruvian

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,420
herb cures covid-19 like who knew right

364
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,880
so lots of that kind of stuff the

365
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,740
biggest one though were sites selling

366
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,880
masks

367
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,459
right there was a mask shortage

368
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,920
I had a cool mask that I made out of a

369
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,660
T-shirt that had my company logo across

370
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,399
there was like a little YouTube video on

371
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,380
how you make a

372
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,540
cloth mask out of a T-shirt that was

373
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,800
kind of fun

374
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,760
um so if you are a human and you're in

375
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,980
the CTC and you want to decide okay is

376
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,500
is this site a scammer not hot like how

377
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,639
do you know

378
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,440
right it looks legit

379
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,779
and you got to remember

380
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,300
that there were a whole bunch of small

381
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,639
manufacturing companies whose business

382
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,680
went poof

383
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,540
right and so they needed something else

384
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,339
and they said oh there's a mask shortage

385
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,740
I can retool my facility to make masks

386
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,019
and so there were a whole lot of new

387
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,760
mask manufacturers or they just wanted

388
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
to do that to be helpful there were a

389
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
lot of people who just wanted to help

390
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,680
right

391
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,720
so you couldn't necessarily say well

392
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,519
this doesn't this this company hasn't

393
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,899
been in business well not as a mask

394
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,399
manufacturer they have it but if you dig

395
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,500
a Little Deeper it's like yeah this is

396
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,060
just the site they set up for the mask

397
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,440
making stuff

398
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,480
but they've been around for 15 years

399
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,980
right

400
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,160
um it's also worth noting that the a lot

401
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,839
of the West African scammers these are

402
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,459
the guys who do pet scams or romance

403
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,959
scams or BEC type stuff they pivoted

404
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
like business opportunity and so they

405
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,300
got into advanced free Advanced fee and

406
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,940
it wasn't free shipment fraud where they

407
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,740
would spin up a professional looking

408
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,180
website

409
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,240
often built by contract in Pakistan

410
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,820
because that's a low-cost area to get

411
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,860
websites built they look really good

412
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,899
talking about you know their long

413
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,620
history as a medical device manufacturer

414
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,620
and then there would be like a fake

415
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,680
logistics company website like this is

416
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,480
who we use for our shipping and so they

417
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,920
would take orders from Desperate

418
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,779
hospitals for like a million dollars

419
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,339
worth of whatever

420
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,320
and ask for a hundred thousand dollar

421
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,940
ten percent you know upfront down

422
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,260
payment

423
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,540
and actually say okay they give them

424
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,579
paperwork showing that it has shipped

425
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,380
and again they've got this Logistics

426
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,540
website that also looks professional

427
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,180
that's who's shipping it so here's your

428
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,860
tracking number go to that website right

429
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
and that's all fake right so they were

430
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,760
that was that was bad

431
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,180
um there was some mail spam like

432
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,320
malicious spam where you have an

433
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,880
attachment

434
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,459
that's covet related in some form

435
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,740
or it's a link to a bad site but anyway

436
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,120
they were trying to get malware on your

437
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,800
computer several malware families doing

438
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
that there was one even a single

439
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,320
coronavirus ransomware that wasn't

440
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,420
really ransomware it was just a bad guy

441
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,339
thought it was a fun name

442
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,019
um it was doing something else

443
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,639
so everybody that was involved in the

444
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,279
CTC kind of shared this opinion that

445
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,860
yeah this is worse than normal right

446
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,440
there is a higher level of bad stuff

447
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,320
going on why it was fun to speculate

448
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,420
about the reasons well we haven't had a

449
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,220
global pandemic on this scale for a

450
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,660
hundred years okay so that's kind of

451
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,800
cool

452
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,440
um not to be facetious but like this is

453
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,139
history happening right around us

454
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,420
um people are somewhere between curious

455
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,480
and desperate we're all shut down stuck

456
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,800
in our homes and we've got this thing

457
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
called the internet which we haven't had

458
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
during a pandemic before

459
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,780
and so that led to probably the

460
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,160
environment where the bad guys were

461
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,020
thinking okay we can be opportunistic

462
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,720
and do some attacking so wading through

463
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
some actual data

464
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
so

465
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,780
we would like get these big lists of

466
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,720
tens of thousands of shady domains

467
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,359
because again this is somebody saying

468
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,699
it's Shady it's not just here are the

469
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,740
new coveted related domains these are

470
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,020
new domains and at least somebody says

471
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,820
they're Shady so you got to take it

472
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,320
seriously so

473
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,400
so one day I actually said okay let's do

474
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
this like more or less scientifically

475
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,580
rather than just whack through the list

476
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,380
let's actually keep track of some stats

477
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,980
so this is looking at 2000 allegedly

478
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,679
Shady domains from one of the shiny new

479
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,080
machine learning systems

480
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,200
um so if you look uh built this out so a

481
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,140
definite false positive is no we've

482
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,360
already had that in our database which

483
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,059
goes back 20 years this domain has been

484
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,740
in there since before the pandemic it's

485
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,419
got a benign rating of benign history

486
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,580
this is a false positive it's not an

487
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,640
evil domain a likely it was me it's not

488
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,080
in the database but I think it's

489
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,580
probably benign

490
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,400
a true positive is no we've got this in

491
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,860
our database marked as malicious from a

492
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,120
high confidence Source because that's

493
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,260
what we do

494
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,000
and then

495
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
um true positive or the Shady no

496
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,220
evidence of benign often evidence of

497
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,799
shadiness most of these placeholders so

498
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,299
if you're doing a machine Learning

499
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,260
System

500
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,960
okay and you and you look at

501
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,140
the false positives 26 and your true

502
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,720
positives of 30 you said this is a

503
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,679
crappy

504
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
machine Learning System because I'm

505
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
basically flipping a coin as to whether

506
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,799
a site is truly malicious or truly

507
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,820
benign

508
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,700
right now if you go to the the Shady

509
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
chunk the vast majority of the list all

510
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,880
right

511
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,500
then you can give the machine Learning

512
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,419
System a little more credit because okay

513
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,000
that's not a malicious domain

514
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
yet it could be right it could become

515
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
malicious in the future but currently

516
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,780
it's not it's a placeholder it's a part

517
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,260
domain there was a ton of domain

518
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,240
speculating going on right people

519
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,919
registering a domain hoping they could

520
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,799
sell it later to somebody but like if

521
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,200
there's a hundred thousand

522
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,600
covid type domain names what are the

523
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,820
odds that anybody actually got rich

524
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,640
selling one of those right that's hard

525
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,500
to do so

526
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,539
um so there's no harm blocking the Shady

527
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,059
ones there's no benign content there in

528
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,320
our judgment so you're not missing out

529
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,299
on anything if you look at that as the

530
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,740
ratio and then hey the machine learning

531
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,380
system's not doing too bad 26 false

532
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,860
positives out of 2000

533
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,160
not good not great but it's it's okay

534
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,140
right so then there were some that were

535
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,400
left there were a few leftovers that

536
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,380
were not in our database yet and so we

537
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,720
used our Dynamic analysis system

538
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,260
and so those 149 broke down like this

539
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,020
again 30 probably Shady maybe maybe

540
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,200
Shady 52 probably benign

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,240
um like fairly strong negative vote

542
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
weaker negative vote neutral mixed votes

543
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,980
probably benign weak positive of those

544
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,679
15 of the 52 as a strong enough

545
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,960
benign vote that it's probably a false

546
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,660
positive so you throw those on the false

547
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,059
positives and false negatives it's still

548
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,799
a decent machine learning system for a

549
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,840
first go for whoever built that

550
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
all right the last thing I wanted to do

551
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,860
as I was getting this talk together is I

552
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,539
thought ooh

553
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,400
I haven't heard anything about monkeypox

554
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,440
I mean I've heard about monkey pox but

555
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,140
in terms of the the web threat space in

556
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,520
the in the domain space I haven't heard

557
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,220
anybody saying that we've got an

558
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,080
epidemic of

559
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,660
fishing malware whatever monkey pox

560
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,940
domains so I haven't heard anything so

561
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,200
let's go look

562
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
you might just not paying attention

563
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,960
maybe so

564
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,539
the timeline here first U.S cases were

565
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,000
back in May it's still officially a

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,799
health emergency not an official

567
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,539
pandemic

568
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,820
um there are people in the health Public

569
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,260
Health space that are saying it should

570
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,000
be a pandemic but that's their arguments

571
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
back and forth

572
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,080
but in my mind this is still a good

573
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,520
comparative for what happened during

574
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,340
covid-19 because it's new relatively

575
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,160
speaking it's exotic it's dangerous

576
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
right

577
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,240
um and so yeah so what do we have going

578
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,460
on so I went back to June 1st so this is

579
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,440
four months right June 's August

580
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,960
September in our Global traffic logs

581
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,539
there are a total of 196 domains or

582
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,419
subdomains that contain monkey pox as

583
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,460
text

584
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,460
and it breaks down like this 62 of those

585
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,400
so almost a third

586
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,840
have already been either already been in

587
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,220
the system or have been put in our

588
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,500
system as benign in our judgment

589
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,400
only 4 and 17 lean shady and definitely

590
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,340
look Shady so it's about a three to one

591
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,340
ratio of benign to to malicious

592
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,880
or benign to Shady which is

593
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
much more benign than the covet world

594
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,980
was and it's also a whole lot less in

595
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,500
terms of sheer number right so both in

596
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,260
terms of overall volume and in the ratio

597
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,740
the monkey pox domain world is much less

598
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,840
Shady

599
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,220
um than kobit was and of the 113 they're

600
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,340
not categorized 16 don't even resolve

601
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,080
okay they're obviously typos where

602
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,140
somebody typed in monkeypox dot

603
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,600
something and it may not even meant as a

604
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,980
domain name but it shows up in the

605
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,419
traffic because it looks like it's a

606
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,400
valid domain name just doesn't exist

607
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,100
another 25 or more placeholders so a

608
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,260
good third of the uncategorized are the

609
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,000
same kinds of like no there's nothing to

610
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,640
see here at all

611
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
so I don't know

612
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,679
um is this just pandemic fatigue that's

613
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,480
why we don't have more monkey pox

614
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,580
domains running around

615
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,100
um there's there's less appetite from

616
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
the domain squatters to try to get rich

617
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,780
with the right monkey pox domain name

618
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,940
versus the right covid-19 domain name

619
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,280
just because they learned the last time

620
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,539
around that no you're not going to make

621
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,760
your fortune selling a disease-related

622
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
domain name

623
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,179
um or we just all have Pandemic fatigue

624
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,220
I don't know but that's

625
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,900
not a lot of threat from the monkey pox

626
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,419
world that is the that's the whole talk

627
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,220
um you can go get lunch now if you have

628
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,039
questions I'm happy to answer that but

629
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,879
thank you for coming
