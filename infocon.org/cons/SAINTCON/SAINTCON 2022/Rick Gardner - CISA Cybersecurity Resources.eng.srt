1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
uh so thanks for uh coming back from uh

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,100
from launch to kind of round two of this

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,280
so I believe I'm assuming most of you

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,860
were at the presentation here at 11 30

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,200
where it was our regional director kind

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,900
of gave an overview of sisa and so I'm

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,699
going to assume some of that in this

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,859
presentation I'm going to go really

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,340
quick I put a ton of slides into this

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,519
um it's not all about it's cyber

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,619
security resources okay so that's what

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,260
we had had entitled this my name's Rick

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,360
Gardner I'm with sisa and I'm the Utah

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,059
cyber security advisor so I'm going to

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,460
try to give you the nuts and bolts of

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,219
cyber security resources that we provide

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,200
but I've got a lot of additional

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,040
training resources at one point we've

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,379
got the Utah sciac that I just want them

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,660
to stand up and I'm going to kind of I

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,579
have a slide in here for them

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,820
we're going to talk about the grant some

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,219
of the monies that are coming out of uh

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,500
sisa to improve cyber security

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,700
resilience across state local areas but

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,799
just a lot of slides so I'm going to go

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,400
quick and really the intent is to you

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,439
know give you these give you an overview

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,380
but if uh if you need to follow up with

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,540
me and you want more information just

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,420
send me an email and so I can send most

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,820
of the stuff I'm going to present and do

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,500
a deeper dive with you if you're if

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,759
you're interested in some of our

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,640
services or you need more information

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,550
real quick about myself I'm

37
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,000
[Music]

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,880
four years in now as a cyber security

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,040
advisor with cisa

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,820
I was their number 11th hire and we're

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,240
at about 60 plus cyber security advisors

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,360
at this point and so this this agency is

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
growing really rapidly and it's been

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,280
really fun to be part of all that and I

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,140
used to have to cover Six States and

46
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,720
then three and now I've just got Utah

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,600
and so uh just having a having a blast

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,399
doing it and I appreciate you guys

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
coming out I I'm also in the military so

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,020
I'm dual-headed so I'm still in the

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,199
military I've got 28 years my last 10

52
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,000
have been on a defensive cyber

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,580
operations team some of our guys are

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,660
here and they're trying to mess around

55
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,540
with their flipper and turn my TV off

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,500
I quit it anyways uh just a ton of fun

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
on on the military side too

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,379
okay so uh with that again this is

59
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,739
really the mission for us is to improve

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,680
resilience and and maturity in critical

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,959
infrastructure so

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,700
um a lot of ways that we're going about

63
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,620
doing that and that's embedded

64
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,720
throughout my presentation so today

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,700
we're focused on cyber security but

66
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,280
there's a lot of other types of people

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
that are across the board working

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
um our mission okay and that's overall

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
resilience and maturity we specifically

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
work with State local tribal territorial

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,260
and we hit the 16 sectors so we're broad

72
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,500
right and if you've got questions save

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
them for the end I'll try to give you

74
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,519
some time at the end for questions but

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,080
this is where it gets to me a little

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,420
complicated it's who do we offer all of

77
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,480
our no cost voluntary resources for

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
we're focused on critical infrastructure

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
that's that's our goal that's the

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,379
Mission Vision and it's where my

81
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,840
priorities are but at the end of the day

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,319
there's a lot of dependencies and

83
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,360
support that critical infrastructure

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,819
needs to overall provide their critical

85
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,580
Services right so it gets a little

86
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,739
complicated

87
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,280
what we what we do primarily results in

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
reports right so when I come in and do

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,659
an assessment you do a pen test

90
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,360
we have this program that really enables

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,879
us as a federal government agency to

92
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,540
work with uh you know uh well the

93
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,340
stakeholders we work with so all 16

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,879
sectors right it's pcii so

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,519
this when we give you our reports they

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
go back through this program pcii

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
because you're part of critical

98
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,299
infrastructure it protects the report

99
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,620
from grama

100
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,040
from foia from civil litigation so

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
there's a lot of value in that so if

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,339
you're a ciso and at the end of the day

103
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,580
you you're voluntarily asking for uh you

104
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,320
know a risk assessment

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,240
there's there's no attribution where

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,419
this is going you you can't be foiled

107
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,820
it's for you it's to enable you it's to

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,160
highlight you know your overall you know

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,440
cyber security posture your risk areas

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,500
and it doesn't go anywhere so very

111
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,479
valuable program and it's really what

112
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,580
enables us to uh

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,259
come on site and have a pretty

114
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,780
transparent assessment on where you're

115
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,419
at right so lots of details I'm going to

116
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,160
continue

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
again I kind of highlighted this but

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,780
there's a CSA and a cyber security

119
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
coordinator CSC

120
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,180
for almost every state at this point so

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,780
Utah is uh still we in fact our CSC is

122
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,940
out for bid now and so that'll be a

123
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,280
position we'll feel here shortly

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
but we're really booming Across the

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,460
Nation so they're they're working

126
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,560
rapidly if you heard our regional

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,540
director

128
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,180
he said he's got three times the amount

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,639
of funding this year than he did last

130
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,600
year to grow our regional capacity so

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
it's pretty neat to be part of all that

132
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,620
and just see more effectively you know

133
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,080
work with you guys and give you some of

134
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
the assessments and the stuff you're

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,560
volunteering for

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
um

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,900
so this is me I'm a cyber security

138
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,940
advisor and these are the things I'm

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,240
really here to do so I'm available in a

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,699
lot of different capacities I primarily

141
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,979
provide on-site cyber security

142
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,660
assessments however I do workshops I I'm

143
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm a collaborator I I work with a lot

144
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,000
of different agencies and at the end of

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
the day

146
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,000
um there's there's quite a bit that I

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,940
can I can provide I'm pretty useful guy

148
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,400
so these are a lot of the things that I

149
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,060
do

150
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,520
so when you think of sisa

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
and you're thinking cyber security

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,440
resources there's a lot of them and so

153
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,419
what you typically do is you start with

154
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,000
me and I work with you on kind of a

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,380
strategic approach and what you you know

156
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,120
where you're at so we call it a cyber

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,400
protective visit and what you're ready

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,440
for you know so I don't typically

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,900
promote and offer a pen test right off

160
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
the bat

161
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
I want to First help you to understand

162
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,620
your overall cyber security posture and

163
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,900
we go from there but we do we do a lot

164
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,240
of stuff but it's kind of a strategic

165
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,419
approach so you're not needing to guess

166
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,940
well what's an RVA and am I ready for

167
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,680
that you know that's more of a

168
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
validation assessment that's something

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
that comes at the end after you've kind

170
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,960
of gone through

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,660
you know what is your posture we get

172
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,400
some phishing campaigns we get some

173
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,919
scans You're Building maturity we're

174
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,020
assessing that maturity and then on to

175
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,419
the next when you think of uh cyber

176
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,880
security it's reoccurring right it's not

177
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,699
something we do once it's it's not a one

178
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,699
and done it's a this should be on a

179
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,880
cyclic type reoccurring uh repeatable

180
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
basis that never really ends and we have

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,460
a lot of things we we can do to keep you

182
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,340
busy basically so this is where I start

183
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,680
so as a CSA

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I can't necessarily it's not smart

185
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,319
really to go right towards a validation

186
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,400
pen test I start with the crr so this is

187
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,220
six hours it's me on site with you

188
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,259
going through a series of about 360

189
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,740
questions okay so this is this is a tool

190
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,080
that Carnegie Mellon University helped

191
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,599
to develop it's based off the nist cyber

192
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,419
security framework and it's it's pretty

193
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,840
it's done pretty well so again no cost

194
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,680
voluntary based off the CSF to include

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,419
the cert rmm or the risk management

196
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,699
model it's going to look at your cyber

197
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,800
security posture you're going to get a

198
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
report the report's about 120 pages and

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,380
we're looking at these 10 domains okay

200
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,240
so we're starting with what do you have

201
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,180
you know asset inventory we're going to

202
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,099
grow from there and you can see we'll

203
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,379
look back then to how is your stuff

204
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,360
configured what are your controls what

205
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
capabilities do you have we specifically

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,820
look at people

207
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,299
technology information

208
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,020
and the facility so so we're looking at

209
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,679
you know those four areas across these

210
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,620
10 domains so it's it's it's pretty when

211
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,480
you think of what is your cyber security

212
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,540
posture it's pretty Broad and this

213
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,880
report helps for you to uh really better

214
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,580
understand what your posture is

215
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,500
and then it's going to give you maturity

216
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,519
indicator level mil one through five so

217
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,760
if you have you know three people and

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
you're providing you know you're the I.T

219
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,160
staff you're responsible for security

220
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,860
it's going to look for you know my

221
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,660
question base is going to be based on

222
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,360
what do you have and is there

223
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,839
overarching policy sop is there

224
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,120
repeatability to what you're doing

225
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,540
and then ultimately going into is there

226
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,600
management oversight to ensure that for

227
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,120
instance when you're you know changing

228
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,580
an access control list on a firewall or

229
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,980
a group policy on a server

230
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,220
is it being tracked you know is it being

231
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
done in accordance with policy and then

232
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,660
we get into the measurement pieces where

233
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,760
is it effective did it have its intended

234
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,860
effect did it work

235
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,320
is there any analytics dashboards

236
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,560
associated with that validation right so

237
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,660
that's how we kind of get from Mill one

238
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,120
to five and that'll all be indicated on

239
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,200
that 120 page report so lots to that

240
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,140
report to include graphs charts green

241
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,600
Amber Reds at the end of the day it's

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,940
going to give you the here is your

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,680
overarching posture

244
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,339
here's what you're doing well green

245
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,440
here's what's a work in progress and or

246
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,899
is maybe travel knowledge it's not

247
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,360
completely repeatable and then finally

248
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,160
the Reds of here's where we have

249
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,420
vulnerabilities these are your

250
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,640
opportunities for improvement again

251
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,220
because this is all non-regulatory

252
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,300
it's just based on framework approach

253
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,040
you do with this report what you want

254
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,260
right at the end of the day it can do

255
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,740
you a lot of good as far as it helps to

256
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,959
formulate a risk register right if I

257
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,120
asked you for your network what is your

258
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,860
cyber security posture

259
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
would you would you kind of know that

260
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,380
what are the top 10 risk areas would you

261
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,860
know that this helps to form that do you

262
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,220
have a risk register for your network

263
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,399
security right so this helps to get that

264
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,560
initial approach to here's where we're

265
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,140
at here's some options for consideration

266
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,779
on on how to improve so it's pretty

267
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,940
valuable again six hours that's me on

268
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,399
site with you I'm at about three months

269
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,500
just keep that in mind I'm always out

270
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,019
about three months and I think it's

271
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,519
going to get worse before it gets better

272
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,980
but I get two new hires like has been

273
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,560
talked to so it'll get better here soon

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,260
but right now I'm out a little ways

275
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,360
okay from there

276
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
it's the second assessment again

277
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,279
strategic approach we want to extend

278
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,220
your posture to external dependencies

279
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,820
supply chain right vendors third parties

280
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,899
so when we have uh and look at our

281
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,959
external dependencies have we applied

282
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,180
the same controls

283
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,160
we have the same you know repeatability

284
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,860
and maturity

285
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,100
on our own networks right as when we

286
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,320
bring in a third party have we applied

287
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,100
those same controls do we have you know

288
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,140
um your boilerplate contract language

289
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,779
does it include those controls with our

290
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,660
with our supply chain so many times

291
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,880
we're compromised right and or

292
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,339
vulnerabilities exist from the outside

293
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,500
those that are connecting in helping us

294
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
and so that's what this one's going to

295
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
give for you so again voluntary this is

296
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,700
about two hours and if you kind of don't

297
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,459
have real mature checklist that what

298
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,200
should we consider

299
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,160
for ensuring our vendor has so for

300
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
instance you know are they patching

301
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,339
their systems we require that you know

302
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,620
we have confidentiality Integrity

303
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,420
availability requirements for our own

304
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,899
network have we insured or passed along

305
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,079
those same controls to the vendors if

306
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,660
you don't have any foreign components in

307
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,420
use by policy on your network

308
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,820
then it have we applied that same

309
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,160
control on theirs or are they coming in

310
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,800
with you know foreign components they're

311
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,779
going to create big vulnerabilities for

312
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,639
us so it's just putting those things

313
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,700
over so again too easy to help you do

314
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,519
the this this is about two hours and

315
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
you'll come out of that with a lot of

316
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
you know again it's it's suggestions

317
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,779
it's opportunities to strengthen improve

318
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,000
your relationship with that with the

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,880
external third-party vendors right

320
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,700
the third thing I do that I really like

321
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,899
this and I think there's a lot of value

322
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,220
in this so

323
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,980
after I've left you with a here's where

324
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,480
you're at here's what we've looked at

325
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,660
with the vendor it's a dashboard so as

326
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,519
you're continuing to make improvements

327
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,800
as you're you know creating priorities

328
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,100
you're adding controls

329
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,660
you're writing policies things are

330
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,380
improving if you record those in this

331
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,060
dashboard that I come on site to help

332
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,320
you build

333
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,260
it's gonna it can do a lot for you so

334
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
the way this is this is kind of done

335
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,459
it's just kind of like the crrs based on

336
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,740
the cyber security framework we have the

337
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,700
same domains we're going to look at okay

338
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,680
and then you're going to have this

339
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,260
formulated dashboard so this serves as a

340
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,500
couple cool things one it helps to

341
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,940
document by put put on you know a

342
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,600
dashboard your your overall posture your

343
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,420
portfolio these are the applications I'm

344
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,940
using this is something that you can now

345
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,160
hand off to somebody right because

346
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,079
that's another risk is that you know

347
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,120
you've done all this work you're a Wan

348
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,740
manager and you've been here for 10

349
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,540
years and now I'm going to go work for

350
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,680
nice

351
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,260
right so well what did you leave behind

352
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,000
can your predecessor pick up understand

353
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,100
you know what kind of where you left off

354
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,980
this helps to do that okay so once it's

355
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,060
created

356
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,380
there's a lot of things I love about

357
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,600
this so kind of check out the uh the

358
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,040
screen on this so

359
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
it will compare you to others in your

360
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,380
same sector so when we talk about these

361
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,040
framework approaches to to going after

362
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,540
our cyber security improving cyber

363
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,000
security we're not we don't all have

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,339
unlimited budgets right we're not all

365
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,699
trying to you know build Fort Knox but

366
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,040
we got we are trying to

367
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,300
um you know

368
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,959
understand our posture and make you know

369
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,360
Investments wisely right

370
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,980
this is going to show you how you

371
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,620
compare to others in your same sector so

372
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,180
I feel like there's a lot of value in

373
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,579
that if you're a water system you

374
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,279
shouldn't be compared to you know a bank

375
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
you know it's going to compare you to

376
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,300
others in your same sector

377
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,940
as you make improvements and you use the

378
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,519
dashboard to track your improvement so

379
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,019
let's say you didn't you weren't

380
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,480
restricting any removable media

381
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,240
you you got that you know accepted into

382
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,740
the business you create that group

383
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,920
policy it's applied it's restricted you

384
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
identify that you mark that on the

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,699
dashboard it's going to show that

386
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,779
Improvement

387
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,480
okay your posture will change live on

388
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,980
the spot you'll be able to see the

389
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,899
improvements in multiple areas because

390
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,300
that actually is is a really good one to

391
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,420
go after but

392
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,019
you're going to be able to run

393
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,300
management reports so you're you're

394
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,040
doing all these changes all these

395
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
improvements throughout the course of

396
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,560
let's say a year

397
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,839
and now you need to show a return on

398
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,180
investment right hey you know we've

399
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,459
given you this four hundred thousand

400
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,980
dollars or whatever right where have you

401
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,139
invested it what has it done for our

402
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,480
business this is a way that it kind of

403
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,100
helps to quantify

404
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,980
that return on investment that's always

405
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,139
a hard thing to do when you're basically

406
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,380
mitigating risk right this this kind of

407
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,360
changes some of that so you can run you

408
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,300
can run management reports the scenarios

409
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,980
are awesome too I'd use my little red

410
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,199
clicker but you can't see it so it

411
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,139
wouldn't do you guys any good but it it

412
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,679
lets you uh run threat scenarios so

413
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,540
again too as you've created this is what

414
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,880
I have let's say you're not backing up

415
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,099
your data off site you're going to

416
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,740
answer it that way and then when it runs

417
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,839
a natural disaster scenario or your

418
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,359
primary site is is you know taken out

419
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,780
it's going to show you how well you have

420
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,400
that continuity

421
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,160
and so once you've identified that those

422
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
those threat scenarios help to put put

423
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,880
in the the you know this is in in life

424
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,919
without that control this is how it's

425
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,380
this is what's going to happen save same

426
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,160
with like a denial of service attack

427
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
ransomware they're doing a lot in this

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,419
dashboard to improve it too just so it

429
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,700
continues to be relevant and gives you

430
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,919
back what you need so this one is about

431
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
uh four hours me on site with you guys

432
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,940
too

433
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,480
okay from there I'm moving into more of

434
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,100
the technical offerings again I'm

435
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,080
focusing right now just kind of on the

436
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,700
sisa stuff

437
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,940
so you had you heard I think Sean uh

438
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,340
speak to we're we're pretty big and

439
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,740
growing there's about a thousand I think

440
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,320
now that are all within sisa we're

441
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,720
division you know we're we have regions

442
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,000
a lot of us forward deployed you know

443
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
I'm right now the only one in Utah but I

444
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,640
go back to you know 30 plus or so in uh

445
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,880
Colorado and then back to you know 800

446
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
or so at headquarters we have a lot of

447
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,600
stuff

448
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,220
and so um I can I can make sure that you

449
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,380
understand better all the things and

450
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,080
that you're engaging smartly and you

451
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
know getting what you want out of us and

452
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,760
I have other teams that help to do those

453
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,440
things too okay so I'm just the tip of

454
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,660
the spear so I'm just re-emphasizing

455
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,360
that so this is something we do really

456
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,320
well so we have an exercise team that

457
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,740
does you you name the scenario a lot of

458
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,539
times if you've never tested your

459
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,340
incident response plan

460
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,280
that's a really good opportunity so this

461
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
team they do this for 16 sectors Across

462
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,880
the Nation they're really good at it you

463
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,320
only have to sit through about four

464
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,539
meetings so these guys are going to

465
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,120
ultimately help to understand what do

466
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,460
you want you know literally what's your

467
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,440
end State your you know what do you want

468
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,980
to have as a result of this exercise and

469
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,640
then they formulate the injects the you

470
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,860
know the strategy so you get what you

471
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,200
want at the end of typically a four hour

472
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,120
exercise so four four hours of planning

473
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,700
we formulate it and then we come out on

474
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,520
site and or remotely and we help to run

475
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,980
it so pretty fun they do a really good

476
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,000
job

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,340
and if you're really struggling with

478
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,940
look I'm an I.T security

479
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,120
and no one really understands what it's

480
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,860
going to be like to go through let's say

481
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,559
a ransomware event you know that's a

482
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,600
great opportunity to well let's create

483
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
some transparency inviting the right

484
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,880
people in the same room going through

485
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,100
through those injects where they get a

486
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,260
kind of feel like hey how's this

487
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,600
Hospital gonna run when we can't

488
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
actually we don't have you know access

489
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,580
to patient records you know are we

490
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,160
shutting our doors down are we accepting

491
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
patients how's this going to continue to

492
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,940
run right so these guys do a good job

493
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,820
think of where you work and if you've

494
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,100
ever done anything like that in the

495
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,500
military we do this all day long where

496
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,240
it's like there's too many of them but

497
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,580
they're fun and you can get a lot out of

498
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,380
it so anyways we do that really well

499
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,880
okay

500
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,460
this is one of the teams we have so they

501
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,919
do malware analysis so if you get hit

502
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,960
with something and you're not sure what

503
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,900
it is send it in will help for you to

504
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,940
understand let's say again I'm going

505
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,039
back to malware there's just it's it's

506
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,980
what's really rampant out there right

507
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
now but you're not sure maybe the

508
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,780
variant of uh ransomware you're dealing

509
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,059
with we help to uh

510
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,460
you to understand that and we usually

511
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,840
have a whole lot that we're going to

512
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,260
give you back to help you

513
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,080
navigate through what you're dealing

514
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,840
with right so this is on my network you

515
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,700
know how to how to kind of eradicate it

516
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
what you're dealing with so white papers

517
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,360
so they've done a really good job with

518
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
that okay

519
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,919
I put this slide right here because

520
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm telling you we do all this stuff

521
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,780
right well we're young as an agency

522
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,659
we're growing we're building but here in

523
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,360
the last uh we're getting backlogged

524
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,780
okay so with elections with a lot of the

525
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,059
the Russia Ukraine stuff the shields up

526
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,240
stuff we're really being sought after

527
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
for a lot of these these services and

528
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
we're getting backed up okay so I put

529
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,159
this here so you kind of understand

530
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,159
you're looking at remote pen testing my

531
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,900
RVA my risk and vulnerability

532
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,539
assessments these things have wait times

533
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,760
like that RVA that's a big one you're

534
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,500
going to wait for every bit of I'm going

535
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,120
to say a whole year in fact we just had

536
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,880
a group get one here that they waited

537
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,580
two years for so again we're not that

538
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,100
agency anymore we're working towards

539
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,000
Effectiveness right but uh it's still

540
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,159
we're getting there so again that's why

541
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,659
that's my job is to help you understand

542
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,600
what you want you know what we offer you

543
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,980
kind of tell me what you want and I

544
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,900
create the this is probably when you're

545
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
going to get it and we have

546
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,940
opportunities to hey you know this is

547
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,679
big for us and we're running let's say

548
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,740
the playoffs here in Utah really is

549
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,299
there nothing you can do well actually I

550
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,679
have some Trump cards that we can say

551
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,000
yeah we're gonna we're gonna get this

552
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,880
it's gonna be quick I can do that in the

553
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,100
region and for the state but everything

554
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,740
has a wait time okay

555
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,360
so but in the meantime while you're

556
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,760
waiting let's say for that RVA that you

557
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,380
know it's going to be a while there's

558
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,419
low hanging things that we can get get

559
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,880
fast okay so this is where

560
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,340
anyone who works with us we really

561
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,039
promote you got to get this right so

562
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
this is this is the vulnerability

563
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,120
scanning this is the nessus you're going

564
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,340
to get a weekly report for us this is

565
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,640
not hard to set up we can get you these

566
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,820
scans running very quickly okay and if

567
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,460
you've worked nessus at all this is it

568
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,380
takes tuning right so this isn't a tool

569
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,059
that just works

570
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,640
um for everybody in the same way it

571
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,039
takes configuring and tuning and at the

572
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,840
end of the day we we're doing a pretty

573
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,880
good job at it and if you're having this

574
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,740
done for you let's say by a vendor or

575
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,059
this is something you run on your own

576
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,520
still would encourage you to validate

577
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
your scans with ours okay so take

578
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,559
advantage of that one

579
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,600
and by the way the way to do these right

580
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
to request this service again through me

581
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
shoot me an email I've got forms you'll

582
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,520
fill them out ask for them I'll

583
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,039
encourage you to better understand I

584
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,659
need to better understand who are you

585
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,600
are you in critical infrastructure

586
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,240
um and I helped to prioritize some of

587
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
that and get you uh what you want okay

588
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,320
from there again this one's available to

589
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,360
you pretty highly available but it's web

590
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,700
application scanning so most of our

591
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,760
stakeholders that request the NASA scans

592
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,600
the phishing or I'm sorry the

593
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
vulnerability SCI High scans

594
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,440
we add this right on there because it

595
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
kind of goes hand in hand this is

596
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
external facing right so yeah I should

597
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,679
have clarified that when we're not

598
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,320
scanning internal devices this is

599
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,900
outward facing devices okay same with

600
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,000
web application scanning so external

601
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,740
facing devices

602
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,980
let us help you to

603
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,200
ensure configuration of your web

604
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,419
application is set up you know properly

605
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,020
there's no vulnerabilities okay

606
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,880
um okay this is another one that would

607
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,340
do pretty good job at fishing so you've

608
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,780
probably all been part of phishing

609
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,120
campaigns in fact I'd say here in this

610
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,940
you know venue you guys are the ones in

611
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,820
charge of them most likely but we do a

612
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,659
good job at this so has anybody received

613
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,700
these from sisa in here and can help to

614
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,620
validate or say yeah we do a good job I

615
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,900
mean these guys are really crafting

616
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,059
their stuff like we're seeing in the

617
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,059
wild and so the way this used to be done

618
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,620
is it was six weeks and done this is now

619
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,900
ongoing so when we set these up for you

620
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,860
they're done in kind of uh complexity

621
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,539
layers so three different ones so it's

622
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,880
kind of a build up mid and then they get

623
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
a little bit more complex but we just

624
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,659
keep them going until you guys really

625
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,400
tell us to stop

626
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
um you get back click rate reports so

627
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,640
that you know as it you know staff you

628
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,440
get a chance to do some more training

629
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,480
and awareness you know on the especially

630
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,580
the clickers right they usually need a

631
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,520
little bit more remediation training but

632
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,760
the more our people are on their toes

633
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,860
right when they're at work and they're

634
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,480
they're hesitating before they're

635
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,919
clicking that's that's kind of the

636
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,720
environment we're trying to create right

637
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,679
we're trying to give our users more

638
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,659
um you know just uh exposure to uh some

639
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,340
of these tactics techniques and

640
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,200
procedures being used to guess against

641
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,080
us so highly recommend a phishing

642
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,779
campaign again all at no cost okay

643
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,480
uh the Vader so these Vaders they're

644
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,360
awesome these are really harder to get

645
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,120
um I re I recommend these typically to

646
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
Industrial Control Systems more complex

647
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,400
type systems but that's this is again A

648
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,240
Team

649
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,419
of really you know high-end very smart

650
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,580
guys in fact a lot of them I'm surprised

651
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,020
with they're from the Cyber protection

652
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,720
teams dods so I've met a lot of these

653
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,779
guys but they do a great job at looking

654
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,779
at your architecture so how how is it

655
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,020
stood up they actually do look at device

656
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,960
configuration they do traffic analysis

657
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,059
and they give you back again like I've

658
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,000
I've previously stated reports on how to

659
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,260
improve okay so PCI protected reports

660
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,380
and and I have worked with some big you

661
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,600
know I'm just gonna no no attribution

662
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,260
but pipeline you know an entity that

663
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,080
brings in six billion a year and they've

664
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,600
paid for a ton of these and they've said

665
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
ours is they're the best they're the

666
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,520
most usable we've found the most and so

667
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,760
it's like just validation to me who's

668
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,100
out here you know pushing some of this

669
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,559
stuff right for your use but they do a

670
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,400
great job so consider a Vader

671
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,020
specifically if you're with any type of

672
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,539
industrial control type system

673
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,580
you have a kind of complex environment

674
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,820
these are these are a really good uh

675
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,220
again no cost service

676
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,919
remote pen testing so this is kind of

677
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,500
obvious right but again before we want

678
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,860
to offer sort of to me this validation

679
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,200
and Pen tests again external facing

680
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
devices

681
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,960
we're going to want to go through some

682
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,760
of those other activities first but we

683
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,020
do pen testing again they're they always

684
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,760
well not always but they'll typically

685
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
find a way in they're pretty good

686
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
actually so again I'm constantly kind of

687
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,659
impressed with the and it was asked in

688
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,059
the last session about kind of the staff

689
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,000
and who who we have and if they're of

690
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,760
how do how is the question but

691
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm seeing some of these guys as the

692
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,980
best and the brightest honestly they're

693
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,840
the guys that could go on to make a heck

694
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,059
of a lot more money but quite honestly

695
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,940
they're really into the mission and

696
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,539
doing some of this work for the nation

697
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:50,580
and uh I I've met a lot of these guys

698
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,740
and they're good so these these rpts

699
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,200
think about that one as a requesting

700
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,960
from sisa and this is the last one so

701
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,260
this is the most comprehensive this is a

702
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,020
tender it's called the RVA so it's risk

703
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,419
and vulnerability assessment and this is

704
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,360
going to give an organization

705
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,960
an external pen test it combines fishing

706
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,539
again these guys are going to probably

707
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,000
end up in your network but you're going

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,179
to work with them as administrators so

709
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,520
that you know I get some things within

710
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
the network are off limits

711
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,080
sometimes

712
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,940
the activity you're doing at a certain

713
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,460
time in the day is off limits so you'll

714
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,860
work with us on the scope we have

715
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,640
agreement for them so it's hey you know

716
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,140
you want us to be there you're voluntary

717
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,179
for us to be here and therefore you know

718
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,179
we're not responsible to right because

719
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,320
we're not uh our stuff's it's it's not

720
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,960
gonna it's not hard knocking and

721
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,279
pounding it's not going to take down

722
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,539
your network

723
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,659
it scans it's validation of password

724
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,059
complexity they have a tool that they

725
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,820
run to validate uh separation of Duties

726
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,100
lease privilege it's it's really cool

727
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,500
some of the tools they use they end up

728
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,640
on site so it's a weak off-site it

729
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,020
results in a week on site and uh they'll

730
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,580
be in your networks and then you're

731
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,520
going to get back these reports on all

732
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,100
the areas that they you know hey we

733
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,779
tested this and weren't able to get in

734
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,320
so validation to include this is where

735
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,600
we did get in this is how maybe they

736
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,899
pivot
