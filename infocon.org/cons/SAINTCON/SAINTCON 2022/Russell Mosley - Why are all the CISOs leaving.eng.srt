1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
thanks for coming I'm super excited to

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,200
be here at saintcon this is my first

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,060
saint con

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,980
um got a slightly older version of my

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,280
deck but I think we're we're good to go

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,840
um so does anybody here know what the

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,000
average tenure of a CSO is today

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,779
less than a year that's a good guess

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,380
anybody else

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,140
18 to 24 months anybody else any other

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,180
numbers you want to throw out there

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,300
three years yeah so I did a lot of

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,679
research on this topic and it really

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,000
depends where you look like there's a

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,920
lot of different studies I saw anywhere

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,280
from 18 months to five years

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,440
um but it feels like most of them are in

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,180
the 24 month range so I'm kind of

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,460
sticking with 24 months two years as an

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,160
average across my research

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480
um

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,760
so a little bit about me and there's a

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,960
couple of the studies that I looked at

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
on the bottom if you want to look at

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,680
them for a reference this ESI thought

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
lab one and this hydrick and struggles I

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,460
don't know how to pronounce that Global

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,280
CSO survey but my name is Russell Mosley

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,739
and I've held CSO roles at two

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,119
organizations

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,720
one was a pretty small tech company

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,420
software company and

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,460
um they were really good about investing

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,080
in cyber security kind of taking the

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,380
recommendations of the team doing

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,700
everything

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,900
um you know that we that we thought

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,299
should be done and from there I moved on

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,520
and took a CSO role at a much larger

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,979
organization both of these are federal

41
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,600
government contractors

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,180
the larger one had just won a lot of

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,520
work and they were looking to grow from

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,259
a few hundred people to well over a

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,020
thousand and they decided that they

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,340
probably should start thinking about

47
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,780
cyber security and wanted to hire the

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,320
first CSO so I took that gig with a lot

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
of promises on the budget and resources

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,659
that would come with it and that's why

51
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,939
I'm now recovering CSO because it didn't

52
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,860
work out that way

53
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,259
um I'm a principal consultant with

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,420
crowdstrike I don't work on the product

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,780
side I work in services on a team called

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,520
strategic advisory

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,098
so in strategic advisory at crowdstrike

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,580
we perform security assessments and we

59
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,680
perform or externally facilitate

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
tabletop exercises so basically

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
practicing your incident response

62
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
process and I really really love doing

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
that I've been on that team for a little

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,800
over a year I've run one of the tabletop

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,420
teams at crowdstrike so that's what I

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,420
get to do every day tomorrow I'm running

67
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,840
a tabletop for a very large

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
international law firm next week I'm

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,440
running one for one of the big four

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
Airlines it's a lot of fun and if

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
anyone's interested in learning more

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,140
about crowdstrike the work we do we're

73
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,840
also recruiting heavily and I'd love to

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,660
talk to you about opportunities there

75
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,640
a third I'm a conference organizer so

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,959
I'm on the board of directors for

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,640
besides charm and that's linked there on

78
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
my Twitter

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
um back in Baltimore I'm from I'm from

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,220
Maryland and I'm also a director with

81
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,739
the blue team Village at Defcon which if

82
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,560
you haven't haven't been to Defcon along

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,099
with the massive uh main con there are

84
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,599
all these Villages that focus on

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
different areas and there's like 20 of

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,620
them and the blue team Village is one of

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,180
the first villages to focus really on

88
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,700
Enterprise cyber security and so I got

89
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,019
involved with that a few years ago and

90
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,780
helped run that event as well I also

91
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,920
volunteered a number of conferences

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,319
every year there's several b-sides back

93
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,319
in the DC area so I help with all those

94
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,580
and I was just at gerk on two weeks ago

95
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,959
and I've already seen a few people that

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,239
I got to see there I was doing his job

97
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,159
on one of the tracks at gercon setting

98
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,480
up the speakers trying to help when

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
their Tech didn't work when they were

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,379
giving presentations so really enjoy

101
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,239
being at conferences and would love to

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
get to know more of you so why am I

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,860
giving this talk

104
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
um well as I kind of just described I've

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,459
been a CSO with a pretty supportive

106
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,319
Organization for cyber security great

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,540
environment to learn a lot and come up

108
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,659
in I've also been a CSO with a not so

109
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,420
supportive organization

110
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,640
um and now I'm a consultant to csos and

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,200
a funny thing happened

112
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,519
um the first like six months it

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,860
crowdstrike into being a consultant and

114
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,200
that was that almost every client I had

115
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,360
either had a new CSO

116
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,760
they had a CSO vacancy or they had a CSO

117
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,620
on the way out it was pretty stunning to

118
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,440
see I mean I had read articles about the

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
short tenure of csos

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,180
and as soon as I got into Consulting I

121
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,460
immediately saw this but I also saw the

122
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,500
impact that it had on organizations with

123
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,820
this turnover

124
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,440
foreign

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,479
so let's start at the beginning

126
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,120
um what's a CSO this is a chief

127
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,340
information security officer supposedly

128
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,600
the person that has overall

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
responsibility for cyber security at an

130
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,540
organization

131
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,580
but if you ask around in the

132
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,259
practitioner Community or you know look

133
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,360
on infosec Twitter you'll see that the

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,340
more common description of the CSO role

135
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,520
is that of scapegoat and I have kind of

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,660
some tweets up here I don't know if you

137
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,919
can read all of them back there in the

138
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,060
back of the room

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,580
but the perception here is that csos are

140
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,259
frequently used as scapegoats when

141
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,060
there's a security breach and they are

142
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,540
fired for it as a result

143
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,800
um now something that I've more

144
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,080
personally observed and felt as a CSO

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,940
was that I was there really you know

146
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,340
simply to check a box right we have a

147
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,259
CSO so cyber security is good we're

148
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,120
covered now right was kind of what I

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
felt and I've observed with a lot of

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,180
other organizations that I've helped in

151
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,800
my role at crowdstrike

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,259
I particularly like this tweet on the

153
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,840
bottom right from Rich Mogul uh where he

154
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,539
says uh job number one for csos is to be

155
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,120
fired after a security incident

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,400
job number two is signing audit

157
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
paperwork

158
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
and somewhere down the stack they do

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,380
security stuff

160
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,080
maybe if they're lucky

161
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,360
and I think that that Rings true in my

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,419
experience as well so

163
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,080
um

164
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,000
you've probably seen the cyber security

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
product like mind map of all the

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,860
different products there's also ones for

167
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,139
like all the different fields that you

168
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,000
can use to show people just like how

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
broad the field is here's one that I

170
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,220
found for CSO responsibilities

171
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,820
and uh just in the center there you have

172
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,300
building relationships leading change

173
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,360
managing finance managing supply chain

174
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,419
core behaviors and leading people

175
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,699
and none of that is cyber security work

176
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,580
right it's all management functions

177
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
then you get out to the perimeter and

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,440
you have management or oversight of

179
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,780
security operations governance you know

180
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,300
risk compliance lots more

181
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,160
um but I think that's okay

182
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,660
um it's the job

183
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,780
csos should be prepared for this

184
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
so I'm not saying that this is an issue

185
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,800
it's just part of the equation to

186
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,900
consider here

187
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,960
and my observation the biggest issue is

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,479
really unrealistic expectations of a

189
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,220
cyber security program

190
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,620
especially at all of the lar I'm sorry

191
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,620
the 99 of organizations that are not

192
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,500
large Enterprise everybody else seems to

193
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,300
have unrealistic expectations of what

194
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,880
cyber security can do with limited

195
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,620
resources you know with a very small

196
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,780
team

197
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,000
uh so here's a meme that I think is

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,740
pretty accurate for reflecting that

199
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,900
right there's your perceived security

200
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,780
plan and then there's the the budget and

201
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,759
then of course the expected Roi at the

202
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,780
bottom

203
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,039
um I like this one for smaller

204
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,099
organizations you know like I said you

205
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,319
hired your CSO so you're good right well

206
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,120
if your budget likes that looks like

207
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,900
that

208
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,340
you know you definitely don't have the

209
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,000
tools for the job

210
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,400
then there's the fact that csos aren't

211
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,780
really chief of anything

212
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,759
so I'm curious what all of you think if

213
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,460
the CSO being that they're the Chief

214
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,500
Information Security Officer is really

215
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,199
part of the c-suite

216
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,880
anyone think they're part of the c-suite

217
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,159
that they're really a c-level executive

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,560
if they actually are

219
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,800
yep so you know it really depends on the

220
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,099
company but in most cases uh they're not

221
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,620
um generally they tend to be director

222
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,780
level VP level they're not really a

223
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,159
full-fledged member of the c-suite

224
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,120
and this is this could be another entire

225
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,220
talk but if you haven't heard about it

226
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,199
you know there's this supposed Talent

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,020
shortage in cyber security right

228
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,520
um and I would agree that there is for

229
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
you know the most experienced folks

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,020
there's definitely a shortage and a lot

231
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
of opportunity but if you're not looking

232
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,559
for a unicorn there's plenty of people

233
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,120
out there and if you're willing to train

234
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
people which is again another entire

235
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,620
talk but have you ever looked at any CSO

236
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,940
jobs on LinkedIn

237
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,700
I grabbed a few here earlier this year I

238
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,640
gave this talk in May and uh at nullocon

239
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
um so I've got three examples here this

240
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,200
Versant Health says there's 430

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,580
applicants for that one uh wish

242
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,000
976 applicants and uh Tupperware got 317

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,100
applicants

244
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,360
now I don't know if there's Bots or

245
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,100
something doing this but I know that

246
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,019
when I was posting jobs at my last CSO

247
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,760
role I would get like 30 applications a

248
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
day for security analysts and engineers

249
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,380
and they seem to be real people

250
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,180
um certainly massive numbers here but

251
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,500
really what I wanted to point out on

252
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,480
this slide is if you look at each one it

253
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,420
shows the level of the role so for

254
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,160
Versant Health it says full-time

255
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,660
director

256
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,440
for which it says full time executive

257
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,740
and for Tupperware it says full-time mid

258
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,580
to senior level

259
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,260
so even these companies don't really

260
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,320
know where a CSO fits

261
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,800
then there's the hiring process

262
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,300
um another Trend that you'll learn about

263
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,459
if you're not already familiar is when

264
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,880
looking for cyber security roles having

265
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
to go through many rounds of interviews

266
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,700
so it's the same for csos

267
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,339
this is from Nikki Bim she posted this I

268
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,100
think this is LinkedIn

269
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,880
um

270
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,160
she's an impressive leader I've had the

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
chance to work with her and she was the

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
CSO at carrier right the HVAC brand

273
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,680
she says he or she had 14 interviews

274
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,000
with GE

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
12 interviews with NBC and neither one

276
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,740
hired her

277
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,320
she's now the CSO at Rockwell Automation

278
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,839
and congrats to her and them but but why

279
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,839
is this why do we have to go through all

280
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,120
of these interviews to get hired

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
um hold on to that thought

282
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
I think this is a really important part

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,399
of the of the equation is reporting

284
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,019
structure

285
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,380
so if you're a CSO and you report to the

286
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,959
CIO your budget is essentially a line

287
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,240
item in the I.T budget

288
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
and it's a it's a really common

289
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,459
reporting structure especially at less

290
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,440
mature organizations in terms of their

291
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,940
cyber security program

292
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,700
but now you're in a situation where you

293
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,800
know confidentiality is really competing

294
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,180
with availability for for dollars

295
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,940
um and I think that csos really should

296
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,079
be seen as there to protect the

297
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,000
company's assets

298
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,740
in my opinion they really shouldn't even

299
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,079
report to the CEO because in this

300
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,220
country

301
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,740
the job of the CEO is really to increase

302
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,560
value for the organization it's not to

303
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
protect assets I would say as a

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,040
generalization

305
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,620
um and the csos rather should report to

306
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,940
the CFO

307
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,880
or the board or a risk officer if you

308
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,040
have that

309
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,720
based on the role and what they should

310
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,540
be doing for these organizations

311
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,980
the government the government is

312
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,420
actually taking notice there was an SEC

313
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,399
ruling actually I think it was a

314
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,920
proposal for new rules that would

315
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
require publicly held companies to have

316
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,140
board directors with cyber security

317
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,019
expertise

318
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,820
now I don't know if that will have any

319
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,040
teeth and you have to Define expertise

320
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,339
right but hopefully

321
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,640
um you know the government will uh as a

322
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,959
result of all the breaches that we see

323
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,240
happening all the time

324
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
um help companies see the importance for

325
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,380
cyber security expertise

326
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,019
but the reality is that um csos are

327
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,720
being used as scapegoats and as check

328
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
boxes for compliance

329
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,720
and they tend to be Chiefs in name only

330
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,579
and usually they don't have sufficient

331
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,680
resources to do their jobs

332
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
take a look at this budget I have

333
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,120
circled here for a 1200 person company

334
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,399
and they have one person listed for

335
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,320
security

336
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,240
and this tweet from guidepoint security

337
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,760
where companies are saying that cyber

338
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,500
insurance is the first line of defense

339
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,680
I actually performed an assessment for a

340
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,300
company this year

341
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
that didn't have anyone dedicated to

342
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,860
cyber security that was one of our

343
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,240
recommendations that they built out a

344
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,639
team and start with somebody at least

345
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,019
the director level

346
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,940
and this was a company with an 800

347
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,940
million dollar a year budget

348
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,320
um with nobody dedicated to cyber

349
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,180
security it's really it's kind of been

350
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,459
surprising to me as a consultant uh the

351
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,200
maturity overall out there because I've

352
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,220
had the opportunity to see some

353
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,019
companies that do have really mature

354
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,240
programs but the majority in my

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,040
experience uh really don't will have

356
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,120
really have a lot of work to do

357
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,820
and so this is the result the csos are

358
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,959
leaving

359
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,600
the average tenure is around two years

360
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,300
uh Coal fire even has a Blog here on

361
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,800
what to do when you are expecting your

362
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,600
CSO to leave

363
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,300
and uh you gotta love seeing things like

364
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,019
the life after CSO podcast

365
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,519
um there's one article there in the back

366
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,399
it's above the coal fire one and it says

367
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,720
that at the time

368
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
24 of Fortune 500 csos were on the job

369
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
for a year

370
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,459
and I think that was from 2020 and and

371
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,459
that largely matches my my Consulting

372
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,819
experience

373
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,800
so it's obvious to me why csos are

374
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
leaving

375
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,720
um you know and there's a lot of ways

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,700
you could sum it up but I think that you

377
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,260
know in general it's a it's a lack of

378
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,800
support it's burnout

379
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,139
[Music]

380
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,100
um

381
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,500
they have accountability for cyber

382
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,079
security breaches without much ownership

383
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,300
and you're generally seen as a junior

384
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,279
exec and a scapegoat

385
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,899
and I like this quote here eventually

386
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,399
you get you get tired of trying to

387
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,660
convince people of all the reasons why

388
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,860
they should listen to you and you Rage

389
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,220
Quit

390
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,880
so what can we do and I want to talk

391
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,839
about

392
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,300
we as an us cyber security practitioners

393
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,339
and then also talk about businesses and

394
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,480
what can they do to improve this

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,100
situation

396
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,779
so

397
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,660
um I see and hear and have said a lot of

398
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,060
things like this many times it's it's

399
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,740
kind of never-ending you know they won't

400
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,880
get you what you need and then they

401
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,639
blame you uh all the execs have admin

402
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
rights

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,660
I had to explain to my CIO that Macs do

404
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,220
get viruses and I think that was like in

405
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,560
2016.

406
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,360
um and of course the we have cyber

407
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
Insurance you know why do we need that

408
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,899
we have cyber insurance

409
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,940
um

410
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,680
well really

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
um have you ever thought that it might

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,040
be it might be us or we might be a part

413
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,260
of the problem yes I have a hard time

414
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,540
seeing with the lights you forgot what

415
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,339
what's that

416
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,920
we're compliant yes

417
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,680
the box is checked

418
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
if you put yourself in the shoes of the

419
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,440
CIO or the CEO of the board

420
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,459
you know they ask us to give them a

421
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,959
presentation we're going to spend our

422
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,699
money on what the results are and a

423
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,320
common question is like well if we do

424
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,360
all this are we secure right can we be

425
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,699
secure and what do we tell them

426
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,980
we tell them no you can never be fully

427
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,620
secure right like you can spend all this

428
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,959
money but if there's a dedicated threat

429
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,940
actor they're still going to get in no

430
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,699
matter how much money we spend

431
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,160
so we tell them they can't be secure and

432
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,720
then we're surprised and we get upset

433
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,540
when they would prefer to buy insurance

434
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,279
rather than spending money on proactive

435
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,139
cyber security

436
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,600
so I'd like you to kind of put yourself

437
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,940
in you know from the lens of

438
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,699
the CIO the CEO other Business Leaders

439
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,620
and think about it try to think about it

440
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,760
from their perspective a little bit

441
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,060
so

442
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,639
um malware Jake Jake Williams he gave a

443
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,279
talk last year at Blue teamcon I was

444
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,019
there and and sat in his talk and took a

445
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,040
lot of notes and it was kind of the

446
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,560
inspiration for me doing this

447
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,839
um his talk was called uh stop talking

448
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,279
Nerdy To Me

449
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,980
translating the value proposition of the

450
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,259
blue team to the c-suite and if you go

451
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,820
look on YouTube you can find it I think

452
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,160
he gave it at a few different events and

453
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,740
at least one of them recorded it

454
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,000
um and I think that he's really right

455
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,579
and uh the talk is excellent

456
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,800
um you know the point here I think is

457
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
that we as a cyber Security

458
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,540
Professionals fail at communicating to

459
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,059
Business Leaders and I like this visual

460
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,480
here you know we show up with massive

461
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,579
amounts of information

462
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,220
you know jargon lists of technical

463
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,400
arguments to explain things

464
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,559
um which really is a waste of time to

465
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,419
these Business Leaders because they

466
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,619
don't understand it the way we

467
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,000
communicate

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,339
so we need to think about and learn to

469
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,199
communicate in ways that Business

470
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,220
Leaders will understand

471
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,780
um and and Jake's tweet uh if you can't

472
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,179
read it what he's saying is if you want

473
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,940
to Turbo Charge your infosec career head

474
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,000
over to the Harvard MBA reading list

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,820
pick a book on business case studies and

476
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,160
start using those to analyze I'm sorry

477
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,100
and nogla I can't pronounce that infosec

478
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,919
issues to The Bu leadership

479
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,260
their analogies won't be perfect but

480
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,320
they didn't understand you at all before

481
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,380
and I think it's a great it's a really a

482
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,480
great suggestion the Harvard MBA reading

483
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,919
list if you have a chance even to read

484
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,200
just a few of those books especially if

485
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
you have interest in cyber security

486
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,100
leadership role at some point in your

487
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,899
career it will it will really be helpful

488
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
um so someone I used to work with he

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,179
liked to say to me stop admiring the

490
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,260
problem

491
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,480
when I was giving him all the reasons

492
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,580
why we should do something differently

493
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,980
or you know invest in something new and

494
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,539
I really love that line

495
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,340
so I think here that you know really the

496
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,900
approach we should take when talking to

497
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,020
Business Leaders is to ask them what the

498
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,940
organization's concerns are about cyber

499
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,020
security

500
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,900
and then shut up and listen

501
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,539
listen to what the business is concerned

502
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,500
with

503
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,260
then after you've done that

504
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,379
suggest solutions to reduce risk

505
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,820
and this is really more going back to

506
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,460
malware Jake's talk last year blue team

507
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,380
con this was his suggestion

508
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,539
that to succeed we need to propose

509
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,760
change in the language of business not

510
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,559
Tech jargon

511
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,000
and understand that business is about

512
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,220
risk I mean also profit But ultimately

513
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,559
business decisions tend to be made based

514
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,980
on risk

515
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,480
So This Thread was interesting and I

516
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,760
love the reply to my comment here but I

517
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,020
was just posting

518
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,360
in response to some Thread about you

519
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,000
know csos making Headway that when I was

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,940
a CSO I tend I tended to make the most

521
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,000
progress at Coffee

522
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,400
uh at lunch and at you know non-business

523
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,419
meetings

524
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,220
um talking to people asking them about

525
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,960
their kids asking them what they did

526
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,059
this weekend because I think it's about

527
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,160
building trust and and relationships

528
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,140
more than anything else you know if you

529
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,280
just invite

530
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
Business Leaders to meetings and tell

531
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
them that you need them to do things

532
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,760
like what's in it for them like you're

533
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,860
making them defensive right you're

534
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,840
basically giving them work without

535
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,820
helping them understand why they have

536
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,440
that work

537
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
um and so I think it's really important

538
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
to try to build relationships in what

539
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
you do

540
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,520
all right so what about businesses

541
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,380
I think it boils down to one word that

542
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,940
they really need to invest in cyber

543
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,020
security

544
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,880
you know they need to stop looking at

545
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,620
security as overhead and really start

546
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,380
looking at it as an investment

547
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,120
but it's up to us the cyber security

548
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,700
Workforce to influence them to do that I

549
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,660
don't think that they're really going to

550
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,440
learn this on their own

551
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,400
so start thinking about cyber security

552
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,480
as asset protection or loss avoidance

553
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,440
so really along the lines of insurance

554
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,059
also consider that cyber security

555
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,760
investment it frees I.T to support

556
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,059
Revenue generating operations by having

557
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,760
a separate security team from I.T this

558
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
is one of those steps in maturity right

559
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,520
you have i t first then you have

560
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,140
dedicated security people who probably

561
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,960
start an I.T before you have a separate

562
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,640
cyber security program

563
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,260
and by having that separate cyber

564
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,059
security program you can free those I.T

565
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,380
people to do what they are there for

566
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,140
right supporting Revenue

567
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,539
also businesses need to take a

568
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,460
risk-based approach to cyber security

569
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,740
which I mentioned before learn about the

570
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,299
organization's risk

571
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,280
then look at where you have risks from a

572
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,740
cyber perspective in that overall risk

573
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,059
program

574
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,039
don't build for compliance it's a good

575
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,900
place to start if for really immature

576
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,280
cyber Security Programs you've always

577
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,539
got that hammer if you have to meet

578
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:28,799
compliance

579
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,120
but risks should be the focus

580
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,780
and I also think that this is really

581
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,520
important to treat staff as Investments

582
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,039
give them what they need tools training

583
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,799
time off

584
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,059
raises to stay current with market value

585
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,700
which is seems to be very rare you know

586
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,559
in most cases people have to change jobs

587
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,260
to move up and to really be compensated

588
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,880
the way that they should be

589
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
and so to validate some of these points

590
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,539
I just wanted to quickly share a few

591
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,620
highlights from one of my favorite

592
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,320
studies on the ROI of cyber security and

593
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
I mentioned this one earlier this is ESI

594
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
thought lab they published this study in

595
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,860
2020 about driving cyber security

596
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,260
performance and they surveyed about a

597
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,460
thousand companies for this so it's

598
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,860
pretty Broad and they rated the cyber

599
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,960
security maturity the Investments the

600
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,000
plans and practices of all these

601
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
different organizations and then

602
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,059
presented their analysis so I just want

603
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,480
to share a few quick nuggets

604
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,640
first they said in here that cyber

605
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,559
security leaders in this case leaders

606
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,179
they mean the leading organizations the

607
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,440
ones that had the best cyber security

608
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,840
program that had reduced risk of the

609
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,460
best with cyber security those

610
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,740
organizations give csos a larger

611
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,780
business role

612
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,700
um so it says that like part the way

613
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,679
down the first paragraph there

614
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,039
um that uh the role of the CSO is really

615
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,260
moved from a generalized I.T role to

616
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,380
that of a specialized cyber risk manager

617
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,480
and in these firms csos typically share

618
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,100
more responsibility for things like

619
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,039
digital transformation and data privacy

620
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,159
they also tend to be involved in more

621
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,260
diverse business areas like operational

622
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,500
resiliency product development Supply

623
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,200
Chain management and even geopolitical

624
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,940
risk management for larger organizations

625
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,159
they also published this list of the

626
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,020
best practices of the Cyber Security

627
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,299
leaders that they observed and I wanted

628
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,820
to call out a few statements here and

629
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,100
number one if you can't read it they

630
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,620
said that leaders invest 25 percent more

631
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,799
than non-leaders on cyber security per

632
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,940
employee

633
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,220
and increase that investment more each

634
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,200
year than the average so this goes to

635
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,659
reinforcing the need for investment

636
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,100
okay

637
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,919
and number three cyber security leaders

638
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,640
have the CSO report to the CEO

639
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
the CEO or the board

640
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,360
there's other good stuff in there as

641
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,659
well but those go to my earlier points

642
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,280
and they consistently use the word

643
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,539
invest here

644
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,100
saying that greater cyber security

645
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,340
investment generates an Roi of close to

646
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,440
two dollars for every dollar spent

647
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
now of course you have to consider who

648
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
are the people who paid for the study

649
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,600
and there are a lot of cyber security

650
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,640
companies in there just wanted to point

651
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
that out

652
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,580
but they also said that leaders that

653
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,520
spend 20 percent more per employee on

654
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,000
cyber security than the non-leaders do

655
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,020
um and then they also talked about

656
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,580
investing in people

657
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,460
and they said that investing in

658
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,919
resources and training is a key plank of

659
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,620
any successful cyber security strategy

660
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,480
that the leading organizations invest

661
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
more in skills training and resources

662
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,820
and that investing in people brings the

663
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,320
biggest reduction in Risk

664
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,539
so what does the future hold for the CSO

665
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,039
role

666
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,600
well certainly higher salaries

667
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,840
particularly after the the Uber CEO was

668
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,700
held liable for the cover-up of their

669
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,539
2016 hack

670
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,780
um

671
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,880
the article on the right what's next for

672
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,440
csos this is from that hydric and

673
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,480
struggle study that I mentioned earlier

674
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,799
and it says something interesting in

675
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,440
there that the majority of csos that

676
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
they

677
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,740
um that they pulled want to be something

678
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,600
other than a CSO

679
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,100
and that more than half of them want to

680
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,820
be board members

681
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,720
and the black box that's hidden in the

682
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,679
back there

683
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,440
it says that the role of the CSO should

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,580
die

685
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,159
that there should be a cro a chief risk

686
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,860
officer and a VP of infosec

687
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,779
with the tech managed by the VP of

688
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,659
infosec and the executive is the risk

689
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,700
officer

690
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,860
a few weeks ago I was at crowdstrike's

691
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,960
Falcon it's the it's our user conference

692
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
and George Kurtz mentioned in his

693
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,640
keynote that something that crowdstrike

694
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,380
is observing is that as Boards of

695
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,960
directors of organizations are turning

696
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,799
over

697
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,220
we are seeing an increase in a trend of

698
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,159
former csos being added to boards

699
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,620
and we are we're hoping that this is a

700
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,360
trend that will continue because it

701
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,159
means that uh there will be more

702
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,600
consideration for cyber security at the

703
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,039
board level and I think that's also

704
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,020
exciting for all of us especially

705
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,159
especially if you have career

706
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,020
aspirations for a cyber security

707
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,820
leadership role that we hopefully will

708
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,320
see more people at higher levels of

709
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,120
organizations with a cyber security

710
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,220
background

711
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,440
so these are my conclusions

712
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,539
cyber security leadership is definitely

713
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,480
a challenging role

714
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,539
success requires Tech and business savvy

715
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,299
I think we all could stand to learn more

716
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,620
about business

717
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,240
and try to look at things Through The

718
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,299
Eyes Of The Business Leaders

719
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,760
Business Leaders need help understanding

720
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,799
the value proposition of cyber security

721
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,419
Investments

722
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,100
and it's really up to us to make that

723
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,279
happen

724
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,480
and businesses should also invest more

725
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,740
in people

726
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
training and stop only hiring the

727
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,440
unicorns

728
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,059
uh and my closing thought is this never

729
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,980
take a CSO role without a guaranteed

730
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,360
exit package

731
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,959
thank you
