1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,820
thanks for everyone

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,179
coming by

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,020
today we're going to talk a little bit

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,440
about not shooting ourself in our feet

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,780
which is something that we in

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,780
information security tend to do more

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,199
often than we like

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,000
first off my name is Tyler Strickland

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,939
I'm a manager of one of the managing

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,619
managers on the detection engineering

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,080
team at Ray Canary I've been there for

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,019
just over a year a great company we get

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,420
to work with some really cool folks

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,660
um fun fact I've now lived in Provo four

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,760
times in my life I can't escape the

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,379
place where it can't escape me I'm not

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,480
quite sure which

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,100
um but it's good to be back it's been 15

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,700
years now

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,640
and before we dive into the content I

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,980
have a warning for you all

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,460
some of this may trigger flashbacks

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,399
of experiences you may have experienced

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,219
some of it may also trigger feelings of

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,359
guilt

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,459
because none of us are perfect in some

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,479
of these areas

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,960
so just to be warned you know you may

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
need to have some of your heart

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,260
medication nearby

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,439
it's a hard subject

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,280
so let's talk about a story so

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,799
in a past life I managed vulnerability

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
management

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,520
and for any of you that's managed

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,259
vulnerability management you know that

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,180
that it can be sometimes a knock down

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,640
drag out fight to try to protect an

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,080
organization

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,939
and when I joined that organization

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,400
there really wasn't much of a

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,700
vulnerability Management program

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,140
effectively we were asking the system

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,700
administrators to log into our

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
vulnerability management tool find the

46
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,720
vulnerabilities they needed to fix and

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,460
go fix them

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,280
and you can imagine that that probably

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,640
didn't work out so well and it didn't no

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,340
one ever fixed anything and over the

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,680
course of the next several years we

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,659
spend a lot of time thinking and working

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,340
toward trying to build a vulnerability

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,680
Management program that actually worked

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,340
within the organization that we were

56
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,040
operating and in the end we did we were

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,319
fixing 80 90 of vulnerabilities within

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
our SLA and some of the foundations of

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,099
how we built that program and other

60
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,360
aspects of our information security

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,300
program or what kind of drove me to look

62
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,099
into

63
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,300
this topic or think a lot about this

64
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,620
topic

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
So today we're going to talk a bit about

66
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,420
some symptoms of relationship issues

67
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,220
between information security and the

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,660
rest of the organization

69
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,060
we're going to talk about a root cause

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,500
for that or something that might be

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,900
leading to some of these symptoms and

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,819
then we'll talk about some treatments

73
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,560
some things that we can do to make

74
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,780
things a little bit better than they are

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,640
today

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
so first off we're going to talk about

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,140
symptoms that we see in our partners

78
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,819
next we'll come back and talk about

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,640
symptoms we see in ourselves

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
it really does feel sometimes like other

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,980
teams do Scurry away when infoset comes

82
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,959
to call right we're you know because we

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,239
bring that pen tester for we bring that

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,700
list of vulnerabilities we bring that

85
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,459
big project that uh perhaps is going to

86
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,019
take away from them delivering on one of

87
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,239
their key deliverables uh or we're

88
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,780
asking them to make a big change to that

89
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,640
major Endeavor that is going to make or

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,140
break the their quarterly goals

91
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,459
so

92
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,140
let's talk about some symptoms here

93
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,319
number one deprioritization

94
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,780
sometimes it feels like

95
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,340
anything that we ask of other teams just

96
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,060
goes really slowly

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,220
right

98
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,140
either some other project is more

99
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,260
important or their resources are

100
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
prioritized elsewhere

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,420
um we just can't get the support we need

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
in the time we need it oh you want to

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,340
fix that vulnerability in a month give

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
me three right

105
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,540
sometimes things just don't flow the way

106
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,019
that we hope or expect them to or other

107
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,180
things that we look at as not being

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,798
critical to the business or definitely

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,440
not security get prioritized but dark

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,680
mode have to have dark mode at the same

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
time we're trying to get them to fix the

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,400
SQL injection that could get you hacked

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,659
any minute now right

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,820
number two avoidance

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,440
this is the part where they kind of

116
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,600
maybe run away from us or they forget to

117
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,880
call us right so there's this in major

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
project that's happening you know the

119
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,780
this thing that's going to drive the

120
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,280
business going forward and we hear about

121
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
it six months in after it's already been

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
designed the requirements are are

123
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,639
decided upon we have a date we've

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,340
already made the press release and oh

125
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,800
infosec by the way

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
should probably know about this

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
but don't change anything please don't

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
change anything because that's going to

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,680
impact our delivery date

130
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,360
they maybe leave us out of important

131
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,800
discussions about systems to buy or

132
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,120
decisions to make about how to design

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,520
certain aspects of the system

134
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,919
I've even seen cases where

135
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,780
other teams within the organization have

136
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,759
had tried to hire their own security

137
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,740
people so they didn't have to work with

138
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,880
us

139
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,940
right so the infrastructure security

140
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,039
liaison or administrator right so then

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
if you know if you want to talk to them

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,580
no you go to that security person they

143
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,100
have to you know somehow sit between you

144
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,520
and The Business

145
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,600
we don't find about problems till they

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,699
are a big problem they've exploded

147
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,740
instead of being something we can fix in

148
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
five minutes they take five weeks or

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
five months right

150
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,039
symptom number three

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,039
Blissful ignorance

152
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,560
maybe they just don't care they're not

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
interested in learning about information

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,660
security or how it impacts their job or

155
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,419
denial that their this for whatever

156
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,620
they're doing has any security

157
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,960
implications

158
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,860
but I need to put that Dev server on the

159
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,240
internet in order to work with our

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,280
partner I have to it's the only way to

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,860
do it and it has to be done yesterday

162
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,240
which is why it's already up there and

163
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,560
you're just now finding out about it

164
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
even though it has RDP exposed to the

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
internet and we're getting attacked left

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,139
and right

167
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,479
that anyone have that experience

168
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,560
what do you mean I shouldn't click on

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,259
every link in every email that's my job

170
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,380
I've heard that right it is my job to

171
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,880
open every attachment and click on every

172
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,900
link

173
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,400
and you know what

174
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
and sometimes it may be actually uh

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,500
that terrifies Us in information

176
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,919
security

177
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,600
and symptom number four outright

178
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,460
hostility

179
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,400
maybe they're not just slowing down

180
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,660
security initiatives but they're

181
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,020
actively working against them

182
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,819
we tell them what best practice is and

183
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:06,960
they say they don't care they want

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
nothing to do with best practice because

185
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,220
in their mind they just have to get that

186
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,660
product delivered

187
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,020
you do your job I'll do mine I even saw

188
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,259
one occasion where a an executive level

189
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,860
person told their team do not talk to

190
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,599
information security

191
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,460
only managers only senior leadership

192
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,599
gets to talk to information security

193
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,740
because they're getting in our way

194
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,620
they're getting on our turf

195
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,259
obviously that does not lead to good

196
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,680
security outcomes uh in fact

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,380
it often leads to things like attrition

198
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,060
it leads to companies having major

199
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,800
security issues down the road

200
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,660
if things have devolved to outright

201
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,160
hostility

202
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,199
there are big problems that are

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,560
happening

204
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,419
now let's talk about some symptoms that

205
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,280
we see within the information security

206
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,000
team itself

207
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,440
first off then US versus them mentality

208
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,419
and I want to say this before I dive

209
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,639
into these I'm as guilty as most of

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,120
these as as probably anyone is we've all

211
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,740
done it we've all experienced some of

212
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,000
these symptoms

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,259
we need to be honest about that with

214
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,639
ourselves

215
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,220
sometimes we feel like we're better than

216
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,020
those teams are working with I know

217
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,639
Windows Administration better than the

218
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,319
windows administrators

219
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,300
and you know what there's some what at

220
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,979
tiny little aspects of it where I may

221
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,219
but I definitely can't do their job

222
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,320
yeah

223
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,880
we've we view it as a roadblock

224
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,140
bonus points out there for anyone who's

225
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,880
heard of the bofh

226
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,500
a

227
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,779
I encourage you to do some Googling and

228
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,580
read some really hilarious stories from

229
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,820
the early days of the pre-internet

230
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,740
um the bastard operator from hell is

231
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,380
about the well is that the bastard

232
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,019
operator administrator from hell but we

233
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,600
view I.T as being a whole bunch of

234
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
people that are bad at their jobs and

235
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,519
they're getting in the way of security

236
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,519
we start talking about pepcac

237
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,620
and losers

238
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,279
and all of that builds up walls and

239
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,820
barriers between us and those teams

240
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,440
I spent some time in the Navy I was an

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,140
Electronics technician

242
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,019
my job was to fix the electronic

243
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,420
equipment that other teams use we

244
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,220
weren't users we didn't use most of the

245
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,380
things that we worked on we had to make

246
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,700
sure it was functional and fix it when

247
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,640
it broke and there was a tendency among

248
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,339
a lot of these Electronics technicians

249
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,620
when the see the uh there's a position

250
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,820
in the Navy called an operations

251
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
specialist they're the ones who

252
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,140
operate Radars right we would fix the

253
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,180
radar they would operate it and they

254
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
would have a problem with it and they'd

255
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,240
call us and say it's broken we come up

256
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
there and like ah you have this switch

257
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
wrong they've flipped we'd flip the

258
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,459
switch and treat them like an idiot

259
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,320
and you know what the next time it broke

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,779
they didn't call us

261
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,940
or when something was really broken they

262
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,260
definitely didn't call us because we're

263
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,880
just going to blame it on them

264
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,959
that's not how you build relationships

265
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,839
threatening to have them fired for

266
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,940
things it doesn't help either

267
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,399
but it happens happens a lot

268
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,380
how many of you have seen

269
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,660
when you know someone proposing that

270
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,540
someone fails three phishing tests and

271
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,399
they should have some sort of a penalty

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,060
like an official on the record penalty

273
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,680
that doesn't help

274
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,940
they're going to be scared they're going

275
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,800
to be skittish with anything that

276
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,359
information is security is involved with

277
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,860
next Bubbles and walls we kind of wall

278
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,600
ourselves off from the organization

279
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
sometimes

280
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,220
we are perhaps afraid that they'll get

281
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
in the way of what we're doing

282
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,680
um we may not consider the impact of our

283
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,040
actions of our projects our proposals

284
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,980
our requirements on those teams

285
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,260
we throw our requests really demands

286
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
over the wall and say hey this is what

287
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,620
you have to do figure it out

288
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,700
you see that I'll often often in

289
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
vulnerability Management Programs right

290
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,019
you run the scan you come up with a list

291
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,339
of 70 000 vulnerabilities you've export

292
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,079
it to excel

293
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,720
you hand it to them and say fix them

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,399
go you have a month

295
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,779
we'll scan it again in a month you

296
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,339
haven't fixed them well you're in

297
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,440
trouble

298
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
it happens far more frequently than most

299
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,360
of us like to admit

300
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,120
another one you can't go live without

301
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,200
this particular control

302
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
you know security architecture there you

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,880
know there's probably a few security

304
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,980
architects in the room

305
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,200
we want to have you know apt level

306
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,640
protection a lot of these applications

307
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
and so we'll sometimes block

308
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,480
applications from going live without

309
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,000
particular controls or things in place

310
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,279
and at the same time across the table

311
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,720
they're they're kind of quaking in their

312
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,519
boots saying but but I have to deliver

313
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,380
tomorrow or next week

314
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,360
no I'm not arguing that they're in the

315
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,160
right but I'm also not arguing that that

316
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,920
we are there there's a there are some

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,420
problems underlying the cover under the

318
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,899
covers there

319
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,880
next smoke and mirrors

320
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,120
who here has used fud to drive Security

321
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,459
Programs

322
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,380
I think most of us have to some degree

323
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,660
or another right fear and certainty and

324
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,000
doubt are something that that get used

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,019
for and against us all the time

326
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,060
we use it in our trainees

327
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,140
we use it in meetings to get our way

328
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,360
we also sometimes try to obscure what

329
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
we're doing

330
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,899
being afraid that they're going to get

331
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,399
in the way of a particular security

332
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,959
program right

333
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,420
oh but but if I install that agent on

334
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,680
there and tell them really what that

335
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,660
agent's going to do because you know

336
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,160
most EDR tools are actually remote

337
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,420
access Trojans right

338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,040
if we tell them what's on that agent can

339
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
actually do they'll actually stop it

340
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,279
they'll get in our way

341
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,500
or my favorite the apts are coming

342
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,779
and I I hope that little QP chart here

343
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,019
doesn't cause trauma in anyone

344
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,940
but sometimes we do act like that as

345
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,339
what's happening

346
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,200
you know we we give them metrics that

347
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,339
say

348
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,620
we stopped 50 000 attacks yesterday

349
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,560
because our firewall blocked 50 000

350
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,979
packets

351
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,339
and then finally

352
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,760
but mommy said so or in in our terms

353
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,980
usually but the CEO said so or the board

354
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,420
said so

355
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,920
we feel like the only way that we can

356
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,540
get anything done is through coercion

357
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,600
we're forcing them right

358
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
um

359
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,120
I was at uh a company that had that was

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,380
a close partner with another company

361
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,139
that had a breach a big company I won't

362
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,019
say the name uh really really big health

363
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,820
or company and we were we worked very

364
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,100
closely with them and so our mandate was

365
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,220
to get it right

366
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
insecurity and you know what

367
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,399
that's the starting point for some

368
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,019
discussions but it can't be the ending

369
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,760
point

370
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
so

371
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,779
some of you might argue

372
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,459
that these things what I'm calling

373
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,760
symptoms are actually causes right these

374
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,860
things that we do are causing those

375
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,540
symptoms either listed for our partners

376
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,740
and you know what you're probably right

377
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,380
they are causes

378
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,240
but they're not

379
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,820
the root cause for a lot of this

380
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,860
I want to propose a root cause that

381
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,940
perhaps underlies some of if not much of

382
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,339
the these issues that we experience

383
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,760
because most of these are in the end

384
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
self-inflicted wounds

385
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,339
so to talk about that root cause I want

386
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,399
to set some fundamental truths here

387
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,980
first off most of the people we're

388
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,440
working with within it

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
and within the business

390
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,579
are good people

391
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,279
trying to do their jobs

392
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,899
they're not hacking the company there

393
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,579
are some that are you know most of us

394
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,019
have dealt with Insider threats that

395
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,279
really are trying to hack the company

396
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,480
from the inside

397
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,100
I've had to deal with those they're not

398
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,839
fun they're the least favorite part of

399
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,940
my job but most of them are

400
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
fundamentally good people trying to do

401
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,000
their job and some of them are really

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,040
good at it and some of them are not as

403
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
good at it just like in information

404
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,959
security we're fundamentally generally

405
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,180
good people not all of us there's some

406
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,440
been some ceases that went a little bit

407
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
off the wire if you read some of these

408
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,620
news stories over the years

409
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,079
but most of us are good people trying to

410
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,339
do good things to protect our

411
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,600
organization

412
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
similarly some of us are really smart

413
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
and some of us are not so smart some of

414
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,120
us are really good at our job some of us

415
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,399
are not as good at our job right

416
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,040
we're all normal good people trying to

417
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,899
do good things

418
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,240
unfortunately

419
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,139
our actions don't always reflect that

420
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,420
good intent some of the things we do so

421
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,699
like those symptoms we just walk through

422
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,579
maybe may not reflect the intent of what

423
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,899
we're trying to do right we're trying to

424
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,060
protect an organization

425
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,680
we're starting to talk about pepcac

426
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,599
doesn't necessarily reflect that intent

427
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,260
I would posit that one of the reasons we

428
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,420
behave the we the way we do

429
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,760
is that we are at War and we feel like

430
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,199
it

431
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,779
our organizations really are under siege

432
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,820
from invisible attackers

433
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,220
that can attack from anywhere at any

434
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,560
time from any angle

435
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,320
it can be a USB dropped in the parking

436
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,860
lot an exploit against a website an

437
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,699
email that gets sent in

438
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,519
it can be physical attacks though I'd

439
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,079
argue those probably happen less than

440
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,240
most of the rest of these

441
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,280
um

442
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,220
attacks can really come from anywhere we

443
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,500
are truly Under Siege and what that

444
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,900
means is

445
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,480
we view ourselves in some way shape or

446
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,500
form as soldiers right we're or security

447
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,419
guards or whatever metaphor you want to

448
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,579
use where they're protecting the

449
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,339
organization in sometimes very literal

450
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,319
physical ways right if we're pulling an

451
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,520
all-nighter trying to respond to

452
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,919
particular vulnerability right we are

453
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,100
putting our body right there trying to

454
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,860
get that that vulnerability addressed

455
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,679
and so we align with this Mission and we

456
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,260
most of us are very deeply committed to

457
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,679
that mission it hurts us

458
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,840
when we're not able to protect our

459
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,780
organization it hurts us when someone

460
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,760
clicks on that email

461
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,500
when someone gets on the phone with that

462
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,539
pen tester to very kindly help them

463
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,000
install malware onto their system that

464
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,320
hurts us at our core

465
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,340
because of this we tend to be very

466
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,900
distrustful distrustful by Nature right

467
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,600
of most of the people in the company buy

468
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,520
their job are trained to be trusting and

469
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,900
to work with each other and be really

470
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,059
nice and we're telling them don't trust

471
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,500
anyone

472
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,140
and that's hard to take for someone for

473
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,820
some people

474
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,640
we also have this constant sense of

475
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,820
urgency everything has to be done right

476
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,080
now

477
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,820
or the attackers are going to get us the

478
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,280
apts are coming now

479
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,799
sometimes these things really do need to

480
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,360
be done right now there's no question

481
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,860
about that

482
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,460
but in our work almost everything has

483
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,160
that sense of urgency to it

484
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,620
and we come to this to build this

485
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,520
mindset where those who do not cooperate

486
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
with us

487
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,900
who do not have the same commitment to

488
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,539
the mission that we do

489
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,880
are our enemies

490
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,620
if you're not with us you're against us

491
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,220
All is fair and Love and War right we

492
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,700
we kind of use that mission to build up

493
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,980
that US versus them mentality

494
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,799
and so because of that view there are

495
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,620
things that we do that will push away

496
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,360
our partners

497
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,340
so I'm going to take

498
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,600
you know we talked about symptoms

499
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,460
earlier so let's take it to a higher

500
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,580
level

501
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,160
these people that should be our allies

502
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,100
often end up our enemies

503
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,600
and here are some reasons why that

504
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
happens

505
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,100
at a fundamental level we tend to do

506
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,660
some basic things we run a rough shot

507
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,940
over our obstacles focus on the mission

508
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,740
more than the people

509
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,980
we don't always follow our own advice

510
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,980
how many of you have said you have to go

511
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,840
through this security assessment process

512
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,720
before your website goes live and then

513
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,039
turned around and sent your own

514
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,080
information security website live

515
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,200
without going through that process

516
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,020
I think a lot of us have

517
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,919
um

518
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,260
sometimes or even kind of jerks about

519
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,720
things right

520
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,740
we we're not that nice sometimes

521
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,600
so what are some of the things that that

522
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,760
fall along these lines number one

523
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,039
poor communication

524
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,799
we don't necessarily share our needs our

525
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,660
plans our goals with with those Partners

526
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,880
in I.T or in the business they don't

527
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,559
understand what we're trying to do or

528
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,820
why we're trying to do it

529
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,980
along the same lines

530
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,860
we don't care or try to understand what

531
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,240
they're trying to do or why they're

532
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
trying to do it

533
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,320
going back to the dark mode example

534
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,700
they may be doing it just because it

535
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,980
looks cool

536
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,020
they may be doing it because one of

537
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,340
their biggest customers said if you

538
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,740
don't get dark mode I'm dropping you

539
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,120
I hope not

540
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,520
that's kind of crazy but things along

541
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,260
those lines happen all the time and if

542
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,059
we don't understand

543
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,260
why they're doing what they do

544
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,500
we can ask them to do some things that

545
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,760
simply don't make sense from their

546
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,260
perspective

547
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,360
we've got to talk to each other instead

548
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,100
of at each other

549
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,939
we've got to listen

550
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,299
next

551
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,400
requirements

552
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,280
following similar lines if we're not

553
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,840
talking to them we don't understand why

554
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,220
they're trying to do what they're doing

555
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,320
or what they're trying to do

556
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,480
we may sometimes give them requirements

557
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,799
that don't make sense from their

558
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,940
perspective

559
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,140
if we look at that vulnerability

560
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,940
Management program example I gave

561
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,480
earlier we have hand someone 70 000

562
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,059
vulnerabilities and say fit it in

563
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,880
their their plates already full in their

564
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,220
minds at least right

565
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,880
we're saying do so much more with the

566
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,980
the time that you have now we're always

567
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,299
saying that we're always going to be

568
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,559
saying that

569
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,220
but the way we say it matters a lot

570
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,100
and if we don't work with them to

571
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,360
understand

572
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,460
the implications of our requirements on

573
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,260
what they're trying to do

574
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,320
we can end up with some very grumpy

575
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,340
people

576
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,379
with some enemies instead of allies

577
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,659
sometimes we put requirements down that

578
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,360
don't necessarily align with risk

579
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,419
they may be they may feel arbitrary or

580
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,460
onerous to the people that are receiving

581
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,559
them now they may not be arbitrary or

582
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,720
onerous we may have very good solid

583
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,480
Logic for them but are we communicating

584
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,360
that to them clearly in a way that they

585
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,240
understand from their perspective

586
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,340
I don't think that we do all that often

587
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,299
we struggle with that in information

588
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,400
security

589
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,900
and again going back to requirements

590
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,960
that we don't necessarily keep ourselves

591
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,539
we can be some pretty big Hypocrites in

592
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,240
information security sometimes

593
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,059
and that burns relationships that causes

594
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,220
us to lose trust with our partners

595
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,919
one example of that was a an

596
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,900
architecture team that I that I knew

597
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,580
that

598
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,159
used an opportunity of a database

599
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,600
upgrade

600
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,480
to say we need to revisit your entire

601
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,360
database architecture

602
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,700
so the database team is walking in

603
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,780
saying we just need to upgrade in

604
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,059
version 11 to version 12.

605
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,320
and it's going to take so many hours

606
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,000
over so much time

607
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,559
and information security comes in and

608
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,320
says oh this is a great opportunity

609
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,940
we haven't been able to look at our

610
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,100
Oracle databases to see if they're

611
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,220
configured properly let's do that now

612
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,559
it's only going to double your time and

613
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,760
your budget

614
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,280
but that's okay right

615
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,559
and then we are surprised when they get

616
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,780
upset or they they struggle with what

617
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,559
we're asking of them

618
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,539
next bad processes

619
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,580
sometimes we're just throwing things at

620
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,620
them without a good well thought out

621
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,020
process that actually works we look back

622
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,400
at that vulnerability Management program

623
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,440
I talked about that existed when I first

624
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
arrived at this company

625
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,860
um

626
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,780
there was no process

627
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,280
it didn't work

628
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,039
they hadn't agreed to anything

629
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,020
um

630
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,460
in time

631
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,280
once we've built a good process

632
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,140
that their leadership especially their

633
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,080
senior leadership c-suite leadership had

634
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,539
agreed to

635
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,380
it made it much easier to be successful

636
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,480
in that in executing that process

637
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,580
because we're not going up to random

638
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,140
system administrator and saying all

639
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,039
right you got to Pat your sister

640
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,240
tomorrow

641
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,460
no we're we're doing something that's

642
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,860
normal that's expected that that their

643
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,780
leadership has bought into

644
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,840
uh in ways that perhaps

645
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,520
they may not have in in the past

646
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,919
you know something that uh

647
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,020
tends to go along these lines is you

648
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,520
know we like to put our our web

649
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,380
application review steps right at the

650
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,179
very end of the process the end of

651
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,220
application development before they go

652
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,400
live

653
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,860
and then that process somehow ends up

654
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,039
taking four to six to eight weeks and

655
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,720
they're sitting there sweat pouring off

656
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,460
of their faces because the press release

657
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,960
says they're going to deliver on a date

658
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,700
if they can't deliver on the date they

659
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,960
don't get their bonus they lose their

660
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,679
job

661
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,779
right we don't understand that we don't

662
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,220
think about that

663
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,840
but it happens

664
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,459
that's why the next item

665
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
risk assessment gaps this kind of

666
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,279
follows along the same lines of

667
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,080
requirements but

668
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,240
when we don't measure risk or we don't

669
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,020
communicate risk to them clearly

670
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,179
or our risk decisions don't match up

671
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,460
with what works in their brain

672
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,320
we can lose trust

673
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,500
example say every two weeks

674
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,320
when the latest Chrome update drops it's

675
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,940
emergency patching time

676
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,919
oh because

677
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,640
every single Chrome update

678
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,620
is critical

679
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,059
every single one

680
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,740
in fact just about every single browser

681
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,559
update is critical if you look at CVSs

682
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,799
score

683
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,080
but if you have to say the sky is

684
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,580
falling every two weeks because Chrome's

685
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,260
getting updated but no one's actually

686
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,400
getting hacked it's not actually

687
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,740
impacting the business you may be losing

688
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,419
trust

689
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,520
we also don't think about acceptable

690
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,000
risk in our business in the I.T world

691
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
there's no way to eliminate all risk we

692
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,740
have to be able to accept some amount of

693
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,900
risk now that should be an educated

694
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,240
decision made by the people who have the

695
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,400
authority to make that decision

696
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,380
but often in information security we

697
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,679
don't like to accept any at all

698
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,940
and that makes us the house of no

699
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,580
anything comes to you nope I said you

700
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,640
know it is our way or the highway

701
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,980
and in the end

702
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,960
if that's how it works

703
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,340
they're going to take the back roads and

704
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,299
they're just going to skip us all

705
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,480
together

706
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,740
so let's talk about a few treatments how

707
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,320
can we do better here

708
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,500
um

709
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,240
there's some behaviors that along the

710
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,679
way can help us

711
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,779
to

712
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,400
to build a stronger relationship with

713
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,960
our partners that that's founded on

714
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,419
trust

715
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,460
number one respect

716
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,700
we need to show them respect

717
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,940
if we go into better than now greater

718
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,799
than thou holier than thou mentality

719
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,720
with our partners

720
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,760
we're building those walls up they're

721
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,440
going to try to run away and run around

722
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,179
us

723
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,919
we need to assume that they have

724
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,580
positive intent we may not understand

725
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,900
their intentions we may not understand

726
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,640
their incentives and we'll talk about

727
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,140
that later

728
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,580
but we need to assume that they're

729
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,679
starting from a good point they're not

730
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,720
always and that's okay

731
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,419
and we can deal with those those moments

732
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,460
uh when we need to

733
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,200
but we need to assume positive intent

734
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,960
that's hard I've seen security

735
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,820
architecture teams who are in the throes

736
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,260
of a Warfare

737
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,059
uh or at least what they felt like was

738
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,240
Warfare where in their minds every

739
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,340
application developed out developer out

740
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,400
there had very negative intent

741
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,220
I don't believe that was the case

742
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,500
I think they had just had they had built

743
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
up a negative relationship over time

744
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,960
to where neither side trusted each other

745
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,179
at all and nothing got done

746
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,820
if we treat them as allies instead of

747
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,159
enemies if we bring them into our

748
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,700
meetings ask for their opinions their

749
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,500
their ideas ask them to help designing

750
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,600
Solutions

751
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,039
we might actually learn something

752
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,740
next communication

753
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,120
we need to shut up and listen sometimes

754
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,340
I've heard I'm not a c so I've never

755
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,779
been a seesaw but I've heard that one of

756
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,240
the most valuable things the CSO can do

757
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,720
is to walk into their peers offices and

758
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
shut up and listen to what their peers

759
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,080
care about

760
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,000
and I believe that

761
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,039
if we are trying to understand what our

762
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,260
peers care about what drives their

763
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,120
business

764
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,740
what they're trying to do what Their

765
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,080
roadmap looks like

766
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,240
and then using that to inform our

767
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,460
roadmap and our decision and our our

768
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,779
design points

769
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,419
are the likelihood of our success goes

770
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,340
through the roof

771
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,820
we need to have honest and direct

772
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,580
conversations with them about risk

773
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,320
and we need to listen to them when they

774
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,179
push back about some of our risk

775
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,559
assessments because sometimes they're

776
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,760
actually right

777
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,960
when I first took over this

778
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,399
vulnerability Management program I was

779
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,960
relatively new to the security industry

780
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,840
and I went down the Chrome is an

781
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,220
emergency patch

782
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,260
Road

783
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,500
and I was fortunate to have a system

784
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,600
administrator that sat me down and said

785
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,580
Tyler is that really the case

786
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,740
is it really an emergency patch

787
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,779
and when I sat down and really thought

788
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,340
about it I had to be honest with myself

789
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,320
and say no it wasn't

790
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,640
now is it something we need to

791
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,020
prioritize and make sure we get out

792
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,100
there in a reasonable amount of time

793
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,799
sure it's not an emergency though

794
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,360
and a lot of the things that we call

795
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,240
emergencies really aren't

796
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,279
one of my big struggle with the the

797
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,080
common vulnerability scoring system that

798
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,340
we use today

799
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,039
is that we don't think as often as we

800
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,559
should about environmental risk we don't

801
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,899
think about the specifics of how the

802
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,640
that particular risk impacts Us in the

803
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,179
organization we see CVSs 9.8 or 10

804
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,279
depending which version of CVSs you're

805
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,120
you're using and we scream patch now or

806
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,580
we're gonna die

807
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,559
but most of the time that's not actually

808
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,980
the case

809
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,940
we also need to help them understand how

810
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,740
their implications and their how their

811
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,700
actions impact risk

812
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,320
uh

813
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,080
I've seen a few cases where

814
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,419
when we talked through the outcome the

815
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,760
output of say a penetration test

816
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,340
and say because of this

817
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,320
the the attackers were able to do that

818
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,960
and and maybe go straight to an example

819
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
in the code or on the system

820
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,419
uh I remember there was a major

821
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,419
uh vulnerability years ago that impacted

822
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,820
our backup systems

823
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,279
and the vulnerability was so reliable

824
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,140
and the people should say the POC was so

825
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,440
reliable that in I could type out a

826
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,179
single line of code and have you know

827
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,880
hit enter and be root on whatever backup

828
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,820
system I wanted to be doing that in

829
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,799
front of them and saying this is the

830
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,940
risk

831
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,980
I'll tell you some backup admins were

832
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,419
scrambling to try to get that fixed

833
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,600
because we brought it home to them

834
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,279
if we can help them understand where

835
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,500
we're coming from it makes a huge

836
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,600
difference and their willingness to work

837
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,640
with us

838
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,440
same thing with any penetration test

839
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,980
output uh a big one nowadays that a lot

840
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,240
of organizations are struggling with is

841
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,039
credentials stored in in source code

842
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,820
repositories

843
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,020
if you can run a scan and show that

844
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,399
there are 50 credentials out there that

845
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,200
work to get into your AWS environment

846
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Etc

847
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,279
that can open some eyes

848
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,740
and perhaps help them understand why

849
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,640
we're doing what we're doing

850
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,559
next we need to consider their

851
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,659
incentives

852
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:19,740
what is driving what they do

853
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,380
what does their bonus depend on

854
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,860
will their boss deny their bonus if they

855
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,360
don't deliver a particular project on

856
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,940
time and infosec is jumping in saying no

857
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,260
no no no no no

858
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,700
you can't do that

859
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,840
there's no way you're going to deliver

860
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,399
that on time because we have our

861
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:38,000
requirements

862
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,419
now sometimes that's the right answer

863
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,760
it's not always though

864
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,980
what does their boss care about

865
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,679
because most of the time

866
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,840
they care about what their boss cares

867
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,539
about our infrastructure team there are

868
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,760
two things that he cared about was email

869
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,100
up was the internet up

870
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,860
if either of those was answered in the

871
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,880
negative

872
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,860
it was all hands on deck

873
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,379
so can you help the boss care about what

874
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,300
you care about

875
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,940
can you speak to them in terms of what

876
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,040
their boss cares about

877
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,199
a lot of the time it's availability for

878
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,260
infrastructure teams at least right

879
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,739
well availability is on the CIA Triad

880
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,560
and if we talk in terms of availability

881
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,759
it can help convey our message

882
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,940
but change absolutely starts at the top

883
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,980
those incentives need to come from the

884
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,619
top ideally from the c-suite if not the

885
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,040
CEO

886
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,800
next we need to look inward we need to

887
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,099
look at our processes to be honest with

888
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,179
ourselves about whether those processes

889
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,399
actually work are they doable

890
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,640
do they actually address risk

891
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,560
or are they simply something to make a

892
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,900
compliance person smile and Nod right

893
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,280
now we have to do our compliance things

894
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,200
there's no question about it but how

895
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
many of these are paper exercises and

896
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,000
how many of them actually impact risk

897
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,680
let's be honest with ourselves about

898
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,140
that are the things that we're asking of

899
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,000
them realistic

900
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,500
do they real are they really going to

901
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,420
have the time to do this

902
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,180
uh do we understand how they're going to

903
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,320
impact things

904
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,020
and our risk assessments accurate

905
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,119
if the sky is always falling it's never

906
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,160
falling

907
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,839
crying wolf

908
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,520
doesn't work

909
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,740
after the first time or two we lose

910
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,098
trust

911
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,380
and number five

912
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,540
help them look good

913
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,000
if we make them look good then they're

914
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
going to be incentivized

915
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
to help us

916
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,780
a number of years ago some of you may

917
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,300
remember a particular Citrix netscaler

918
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,619
vulnerability

919
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,339
uh that that became a big thing right

920
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,660
before Christmas this was somewhere

921
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,200
around oh 2019 period I think

922
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,960
and this was the real deal this was

923
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,800
something that was easily exploitable

924
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,920
um netscaler a lot of the time is on the

925
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,260
Internet by by Design it's just what

926
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,760
what it does

927
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,700
and so we ended up having to ask our

928
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,940
Citrix administrators to work

929
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,280
on Christmas Eve Christmas day to patch

930
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,800
this vulnerability

931
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,680
and you know what it hurt me to do that

932
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,180
because that's the last thing I want to

933
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,740
have to ask of anyone

934
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,800
but we did and they did we got the

935
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,859
vulnerability passion within two weeks

936
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,000
organizations throughout the globe were

937
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,900
getting hacked through this

938
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,040
vulnerability

939
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,460
it was the real deal

940
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,480
but when we limit

941
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,060
what we're doing to the real deal we can

942
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,980
we can make a lot of difference

943
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,260
now that Citrix admin who was working

944
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,940
those long hours on Christmas Eve and

945
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,619
Christmas Day and a couple days

946
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,060
afterwards

947
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,460
we have we were fortunate we had an

948
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,160
internal program to be able to give a

949
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,660
spot bonus to someone

950
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,220
we were able to give that person 500

951
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,578
dollars

952
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,900
to say thank you

953
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,859
that same person

954
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,599
a year or two later

955
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
reported pen testers out of the boo they

956
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
saw something weird

957
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,260
and they challenged the pen testers

958
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,180
and helped us block what they were

959
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,320
trying to do

960
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,500
these things work if we can win allies

961
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,000
across the company

962
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,640
they will tell us things are broken

963
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,079
early

964
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,000
and we can fix them before it's hard too

965
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,780
hard to fix them

966
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,980
some of you may be thinking but Tyler

967
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,260
does that mean we have to be a pushover

968
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,240
no it doesn't not at all

969
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,900
we can still be hard on problems

970
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,280
while being nice to people

971
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,380
do we have to condone bad behavior

972
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,500
absolutely not please don't

973
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,400
but we can condone bad behavior

974
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,339
while fighting day and night against the

975
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,720
true threat actors that are out there

976
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,640
will this lead to worse security

977
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,140
outcomes

978
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,400
well

979
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,980
sometimes being mean gets you results

980
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,839
really quickly

981
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,700
but that tends to die off

982
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,619
even quicker

983
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,900
we can build these relationships the end

984
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,380
result will be far far better

985
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,599
than it would have been if we were jerks

986
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,900
about it

987
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,760
so in summary

988
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,880
most people are good

989
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,119
infosec is hard it's dang hard

990
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,980
relationships are hard too

991
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,320
but if we approach things from this

992
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,560
mentality of we're in a war

993
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,660
they're blocking our battles

994
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,820
their enemies

995
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,520
then that will sabotage what we're

996
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,119
trying to do

997
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,400
if we treat them like allies if we help

998
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,900
them to understand where we're coming

999
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
from and we try to understand where

1000
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,740
they're coming from

1001
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,359
we're gonna win a lot more than we fail

1002
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,560
and we're probably going to win a lot

1003
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,359
more than we do today

1004
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,700
so

1005
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,099
just be excellent to each other that's

1006
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,940
really all you need to do

1007
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
we'll leave a a couple moments for

1008
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,980
questions or thoughts if anyone has them

1009
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,099
um

1010
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,119
final note here I work for Red Canary

1011
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,000
this is in the sales pitch I love their

1012
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,859
core values

1013
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,300
to try to do what's right for the

1014
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,040
customer and we're kind and authentic

1015
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,140
and that is a value that I I have seen

1016
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,680
uh demonstrated day in and day out

1017
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,440
if you want to learn more about this

1018
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,540
topic or review some of the stuff we've

1019
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,359
taught I've talked about uh I wrote a

1020
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,220
blog entry to go along with this if you

1021
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,920
go to Ray canary.com

1022
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,660
you'll find that blog

1023
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,720
um

1024
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,700
and you know we'd love to hear your

1025
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,400
thoughts and experiences so I'll open it

1026
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,660
up if anyone's like would like to throw

1027
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,140
anything out

1028
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,119
all right go ahead

1029
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,320
favorite books is the question uh I

1030
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,119
would say one that I'm actually reading

1031
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,220
through right now that I find a really

1032
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,640
good example of this is radical candor

1033
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
um radical Candor is about combining

1034
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,520
being direct with people when they need

1035
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,579
it with

1036
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,440
really showing them respect and kindness

1037
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,180
along the way

1038
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,320
um I think it is a strong

1039
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,540
uh approach to solving problems in ways

1040
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,279
that that don't burn relationships

1041
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,680
another thing I'll recommend is actually

1042
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,859
learning about negotiation I went I had

1043
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,780
a an employer that was kind enough to

1044
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,579
send me to a negotiation course for my

1045
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,440
annual personal development a few years

1046
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,099
ago and that absolutely changed how I

1047
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,339
how I saw working with our partners

1048
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:39,660
that's really where the the point about

1049
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,820
thinking about incentives comes comes

1050
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,940
from uh you can negotiate far better if

1051
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,740
you understand the the incentives that

1052
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,619
that uh that are driving our other

1053
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:50,820
people

1054
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,800
so another another question yep

1055
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,459
communicate with them

1056
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,020
especially with certain companies all

1057
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,200
those girls I just described in 198

1058
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
2

1059
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,540
so the question is how do you

1060
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,920
communicate these priorities outside of

1061
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,960
security

1062
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,800
outside of I.T I think these principles

1063
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,020
align to that perfectly and and what I

1064
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,119
what I say when I or what I mean when I

1065
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,380
say that is

1066
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
if we go to say a manufacturing Boston

1067
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,000
we try to understand what's driving them

1068
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,099
and what their goals are

1069
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,319
and then we start talking about how

1070
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,359
security can impact those goals and how

1071
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,500
we can help with those goals

1072
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,640
I think we find that we have a lot in

1073
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,800
common you know there may be heavily

1074
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,680
focused on certain aspects of it and we

1075
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,960
may need to tune our our approach to

1076
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,240
certain things uh to meet what they're

1077
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,619
trying to do obviously operational

1078
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,319
technology is its own Beast it requires

1079
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:21,240
its own approach but you know in a

1080
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,960
hospital environment in a uh you know

1081
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,220
any sort of environment that isn't

1082
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,560
focused on technology those same core

1083
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,020
values can apply if we show respect to

1084
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,160
our peers if we're trying to understand

1085
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,599
where we're coming where they're coming

1086
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,700
from and we communicate with them if we

1087
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,560
listen

1088
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,119
um I think we can achieve a lot

1089
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,339
any other thoughts or questions out

1090
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:45,300
there

1091
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,140
oh go ahead

1092
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,140
so the question is how do we incentivize

1093
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,900
security incident reporting

1094
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,520
um I think there are a few ways we can

1095
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,859
do that one of them can be to help them

1096
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:10,980
understand the impact of security

1097
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,060
incidents maybe have demonstrations of

1098
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,980
of things that are happening when they

1099
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,660
click that link what actually happens

1100
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,400
you know get one of your red team guys

1101
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,500
maybe or a red team person if you want

1102
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,300
to operate a consultant this is what

1103
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,500
happens when you click click that

1104
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,880
phishing link

1105
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,900
um

1106
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,859
another way is to

1107
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:34,040
talk about

1108
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,359
maybe some of their personal challenges

1109
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,859
and how it impacts them personally and

1110
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,319
there was a you know

1111
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,140
we for an education program a couple

1112
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,540
years ago we talked about how to secure

1113
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,760
passwords and focus but on like on purp

1114
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,880
people's personal passwords at home how

1115
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,839
they could use I think we were talking

1116
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,460
about keepass at the time

1117
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,560
and there was a tremendous amount of

1118
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,180
interest because people are worried

1119
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,500
about hackers getting into their bank

1120
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,579
account

1121
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:03,180
and so if we can talk to them in in

1122
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,740
terms of the things that they care about

1123
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,180
in terms of their day-to-day business

1124
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,819
and help them to really understand the

1125
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,740
attacks that they're going to see

1126
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,540
and the types of things they might

1127
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,119
observe I think it can it can help

1128
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,420
um one of the things that uh I think

1129
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,339
he was the second keynote we had this

1130
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,560
morning talked about a lot of our

1131
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,300
training doesn't necessarily align with

1132
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,920
the attacks that that people actually

1133
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,280
see I think if we if we can align that

1134
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,900
training to the things that they're

1135
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,160
going to encounter in their day-to-day

1136
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,079
business

1137
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,880
and especially if we stuff that they can

1138
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,920
encounter in their personal lives

1139
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,300
that will make a big difference there

1140
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,599
all right any other final thoughts we're

1141
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,140
at uh last five minutes here

1142
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,880
if not we'll close it out thank you

1143
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,619
everyone for coming along I'll be around

1144
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,060
the next few days either walking around

1145
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,520
or hanging out of the ray Canary Booth

1146
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,100
uh would love to chat with you

1147
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:11,080
[Applause]
