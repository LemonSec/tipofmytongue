1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
so just get into this real quick and

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,080
talk about building socks and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
foundations of security operations talk

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,740
about who I am real quick my name is

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,000
Bart stump for those of you who don't

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,059
know me I work with most you know

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,160
grifter he and I helped run the uh the

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,719
black hat knock there I've done that for

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,420
about 15 years now uh so being been

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,980
pretty involved with

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,260
building knocks socks and technology and

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,760
kind of running that and and talk about

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,199
some of my experiences here and how we

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,960
can relate that to your day jobs so who

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,180
am I again a little bit about that what

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,820
I what I do at black hat I'm also a

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,280
senior SC during the day with netwitness

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,059
I have twin boys that turn 15 in April

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,800
and a covid dog so

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
all right let's get into it

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
so the way I'm going to kind of Base all

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,680
of this and what I built it off of is

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,200
people processing technology uh you hear

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,360
those terms thrown around quite a bit in

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,879
the sales world we use that a lot uh but

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,079
there is

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,600
a a business framework that was set up

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,699
using people processing technology and

29
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:03,660
the biggest thing that we'll talk about

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,820
with these is the balance between the

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,900
three

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,360
so the people process technology

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,140
framework uh Loosely I would call it a

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,040
framework I don't know if there's

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,020
anything specific that way but it's kind

36
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,420
of a methodology more than anything

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,520
um so what do they do what are we

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
talking about for the most part it's all

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,159
pretty straightforward right but when we

40
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,320
talk about people the people do the work

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,299
okay so you have people that are sitting

42
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,340
in this case we'll talk about socks the

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,780
people are doing the work that that

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,280
needs to be done and what the function

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,140
of that sock is

46
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,000
the processes make that work more

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,740
efficient so when we have something to

48
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,119
do those people know what they're

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,740
supposed to do to accomplish that task

50
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,840
to get through whatever that goal is

51
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,060
those processes make those people more

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,259
efficient

53
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,119
and then the technology helps people

54
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,780
their tasks helps people do their tasks

55
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,119
and automate those processes and there's

56
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,079
a little bit to talk about with

57
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,240
automation we'll get into a bit here but

58
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,979
again these these three pieces are all

59
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,299
about balance

60
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,700
uh it's been around since the early 60s

61
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,219
but was popularized popularized excuse

62
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,979
me in infosec in the late 90s by Bruce

63
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,160
schneier we all know who Bruce is

64
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,020
um the the pieces to this is that

65
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,340
everything changes right especially in

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,959
our industry

67
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,360
minute to minute day by day things

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,099
change right people process and

69
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,379
technology and so it's all about

70
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,780
adapting those pieces to each other and

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,640
kind of finding the balance between them

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
uh if you don't have strong processes

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,560
the actions of people can be highly

74
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,239
ineffective and waste the value of these

75
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,640
the existing technology and therefore

76
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,560
money and the amount of time that I've

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,900
seen shelf where in the sales world is

78
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,800
uh

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,420
there's a lot of money wasted because of

80
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,319
that kind of stuff because we didn't

81
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,459
have the right people we didn't have the

82
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,319
right processes we didn't have the the

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,760
amount of people to implement that type

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,099
of thing but it seemed like a

85
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,720
um a golden ticket right to solve all of

86
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,220
our problems so we have to find the

87
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,200
right balance

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
so if you think of it as a three-legged

89
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,019
stool

90
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,700
people processing technology always

91
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,680
changes right so again people come and

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
go the experience that those people have

93
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,420
will come and go the technology changes

94
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,400
as we all know on a daily basis and

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,900
therefore one of the things that doesn't

96
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
change but should is the processes so if

97
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,500
we have this three-legged stool and one

98
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,180
day we get some really cool technology

99
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,400
we add to it and that lag's the only

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,440
long one we don't have the processes and

101
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,260
people to run it we're going to run into

102
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,640
one of the worst things that we could

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
have uh in a sock right so when we have

104
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,900
to stuff something under that leg we

105
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,900
have to find the balance by kind of

106
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,420
hiding other things right and making up

107
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,980
for where we lack in those other areas

108
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
it can certainly become annoying you're

109
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,640
going to find that again the people will

110
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,200
be more efficient maybe the process

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,239
isn't haven't caught up or maybe that we

112
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,620
don't have the right technology that

113
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,299
we'd need at this point to solve a

114
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,620
certain problem

115
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,360
some of those examples of finding that

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,739
balance

117
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,760
um

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,560
Gabby gave a talk earlier about threat

119
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,879
hunting if we have threat hunting

120
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
without visibility it's obviously not

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,760
really going to be a thing but if you

122
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,140
hire threat Hunters

123
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,819
that can't threat hunt that's going to

124
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,620
be a problem if we have Technical

125
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,540
Solutions that we don't have the people

126
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,700
to run or to operate throughout the day

127
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,739
those will also cause US problems so the

128
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,540
balance between all these three these

129
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,079
three things changes daily

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,639
so let's dive into what the people are

131
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,440
the people again are the human resources

132
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
available to the organization or sock

133
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,180
and they do the work

134
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,520
so talking about the brain power

135
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,540
um

136
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,460
as we've talked about the processes in

137
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,259
technology really affect the people that

138
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,419
you hire and need on your team some of

139
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,979
this I'll tie back into in some stories

140
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,419
that we've done at black hat and things

141
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,680
over the years

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,479
but as far as the people go for us in

143
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,060
the socket black hat it really

144
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,520
it really is the the key to what we have

145
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,800
I am far from the smartest guy in that

146
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,060
room

147
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,960
um

148
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
I would say I've kind of grown more in

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
the role of a leader as far as pointing

150
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,419
people in the right direction and making

151
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,560
sure that we have the right people

152
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,540
making sure we have the right technology

153
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,699
and processes in some of those cases

154
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,199
but these are the pieces to think about

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,020
when we get into talking about people so

156
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,460
between the experience and expertise

157
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,180
let's give some examples here again

158
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,259
really quick so if you're at a

159
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,060
university

160
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,620
and the IET Department in that

161
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,979
University is generally uh compromised

162
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,560
of of comprised of people that are

163
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,479
students or people that haven't

164
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,620
necessarily been in the industry very

165
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,720
long you may have one or two people that

166
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,520
are a little more senior and have some

167
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,020
experience that can help out with that

168
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,419
but you really need to kind of balance

169
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,979
what that looks like even within your

170
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,440
people so hiring a bunch of new guys

171
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,300
that are straight out of college may not

172
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,440
help if you have a whole bunch of new

173
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,520
technology that you're trying to

174
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,699
implement or super deep processes that

175
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,160
those people may not be experienced with

176
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,340
so uh at that point too we're also

177
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,800
talking about what do we need inside of

178
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,780
our socks so again based on the

179
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,160
technology and the processes that we

180
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,259
have do we need red team blue team

181
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,060
people do we need threat Hunters do we

182
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,340
need analysts uh do we need senior guys

183
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,320
that are specific to a firewall

184
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
technology a Waf technology there's a

185
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,400
lot of things that kind of come into

186
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,100
play here and and I'm gonna beat this

187
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,840
dead horse the whole talk but it's all

188
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,220
about the balance and kind of where that

189
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,680
comes from I've seen people that will go

190
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,419
out and pay

191
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,100
the smartest person they know the

192
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,600
biggest person in the industry whoever

193
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,580
they can to make a splash they pay them

194
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,500
and that person goes and works there for

195
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,940
maybe six months because there isn't the

196
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,500
work to do there isn't anything for them

197
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,840
to do they don't feel productive there's

198
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,100
definitely a balance within the people

199
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,360
that we have to find as well

200
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
so uh retention and turnover and then I

201
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,900
kind of have sub all of their culture

202
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,580
it's a big deal as well when we're

203
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,139
talking about people so let's say that

204
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,300
we can hire these people we have the

205
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,319
people that we need we have the

206
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,639
expertise that we need we have the

207
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
experience that we need

208
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,780
can we keep those people is there a

209
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,900
problem that we have at our company

210
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,660
um that that we're not enabling people

211
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,979
maybe we're not paying them what we

212
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,060
should

213
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,060
again an example here University versus

214
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,940
a Silicon Valley tech company right so

215
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,620
is it going to be as compelling for

216
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,240
someone getting into the industry to

217
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,979
stay at a university when they've been

218
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,840
offered

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,060
double the salary moving to Silicon

220
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,380
Valley right there's there's a

221
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,600
completely different conversation with

222
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
that as well there's a lot more that

223
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,300
comes to it but there is something to to

224
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,199
be said about keeping your people right

225
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,060
um Technical enablement and training so

226
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,280
again we may hire somebody at super

227
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,020
senior he may know a lot have the

228
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,759
experience that we need in running what

229
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,740
we have as far as the technology goes

230
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,020
and even the processes in some cases

231
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,759
but once we change that and we're not

232
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,560
enabling those people there's definitely

233
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,360
a reason for them to look elsewhere and

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,500
if there's one thing that we know about

235
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,780
this industry is that there is plenty of

236
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,759
opportunities so if we let people start

237
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,419
looking they will likely find something

238
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,740
looking isn't always a bad thing either

239
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,440
though so let's let people grow help

240
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,800
them grow where we're at in our

241
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,479
specific sock at that point and and

242
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,919
really just breed a good culture

243
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,560
enabling those people breeding a great

244
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,840
culture keeping people around is also as

245
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,580
big sometimes as it is hiring the right

246
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
people right

247
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,720
um tribal knowledge one last example

248
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,940
about that tribal knowledge is a huge

249
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,860
deal that I've seen at some companies

250
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
people leave and there's literally a

251
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,240
different company a gaping knowledge

252
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,460
hole of the existing environment that

253
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
exists so again keeping people happy

254
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,199
breeding a good culture and making sure

255
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,819
that they stay is just as big as finding

256
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,979
the right people

257
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,599
so what are some different roles that we

258
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,020
may need again looking at what that is

259
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,339
with people and what we're looking for

260
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,159
in people it depends on our environment

261
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,820
right so we may need

262
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,320
l1234 analysts right how high do we go

263
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,940
there some other things that will come

264
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,600
into play here will also be mssps

265
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,640
Consulting we may not hire everybody

266
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,440
specifically but we still need that

267
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,080
maybe it's a one-time use to to deploy a

268
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,519
new technology or Implement new

269
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,959
processes that we haven't really worked

270
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:58,940
with before

271
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,580
finding that specialty isn't necessarily

272
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,260
mean hiring somebody or having somebody

273
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,820
on staff either right so there's a lot

274
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,100
to it when it comes to the people and

275
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,920
the roles that we provide

276
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
contractors resident Engineers or all

277
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,740
all different options there and kind of

278
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,060
what we're looking for and what we need

279
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,019
to

280
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,860
um

281
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,100
use to be successful in the sock

282
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,580
budget so when I say budget and we're

283
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,160
talking about people it's not always

284
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,720
salaries right

285
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,459
obviously budget will come into play for

286
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,560
a whole lot of other things now if we're

287
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,019
paying for an mssp or if we're paying

288
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,060
for contractors or paying for Resident

289
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,220
Engineers that obviously comes into play

290
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,019
and that's more than that person's

291
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,760
salary in most cases right

292
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
uh the technology Consulting support

293
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,660
maintenance unexpected costs albeit a

294
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,240
pandemic or a breach or anything else

295
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,860
like that these are all things that take

296
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,180
into consideration when you're talking

297
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,100
about the budget and the people

298
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,899
and then again

299
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,220
um

300
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,540
with some of the other things that we

301
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
just talked about with culture and kind

302
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,240
of breeding a good environment for those

303
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,980
people that want to stay in there is

304
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,839
there is a cost to that in some cases so

305
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,959
culture building Technical enablement

306
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,640
Training things to keep your people

307
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,339
happy and stay around is is certainly a

308
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,700
big piece

309
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,920
so the processes what are the processes

310
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
do and kind of how do they play into the

311
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,700
people and the technology as we get into

312
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,800
that so they're repeatable actions that

313
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,420
theoretically will produce the same

314
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,320
result

315
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,779
independent of who performs them so

316
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,240
again if we're having turnover if we

317
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
have people that come and go and grow

318
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,899
and move on we need to be able to to run

319
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,640
that operation the same that we did when

320
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,140
that person was there right so these

321
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,180
processes need to be documented they

322
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,500
need to be practiced and they need to

323
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,899
make sure that it's it's repeatable for

324
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,360
everybody that's doing it

325
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,519
so jumping into processes and kind of

326
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,500
having a plan now I talked about it

327
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,420
again and we're beating this dead horse

328
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,700
that is called balance but the people in

329
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,860
technology are going to affect the

330
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,540
processes that you can and should run

331
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,700
within your organization

332
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,240
if we are implementing processes that

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,620
don't apply to us right obviously that's

334
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,880
a problem or even if they haven't been

335
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,740
updated in five ten years that's that's

336
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,019
equally a problem

337
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,940
so where to start

338
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,680
what kind of processes should we have

339
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,839
how do we keep our people

340
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,339
uh productive and and complement them

341
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,720
generally where we start you're going to

342
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,579
be compelled to follow a certain

343
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,320
framework or a certain compliance

344
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,420
because of the industry here right

345
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,100
and that's

346
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,320
that's big enough to see this this eye

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,899
chart is there for a reason this isn't

348
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,760
even all of them right so if we're in

349
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,160
health care or education or the energy

350
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,760
sector or government compliance or

351
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,360
compliance that we have to follow

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,839
because of a parent company I've seen

353
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,980
Acquisitions that corporations have to

354
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,360
deal with all kinds of stuff because the

355
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
parent Corp now has different processes

356
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,560
and procedures right and they try and

357
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,620
trickle that down

358
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,579
compliance is a huge deal and it's

359
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,680
certainly somewhere to start it'll give

360
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,720
us a lot to build off of and it'll give

361
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,279
us a really good base on what we're

362
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,779
looking for and what we need to be aware

363
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,040
of

364
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,440
one big thing that I always tell people

365
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
though and I think

366
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,100
doesn't get said enough is that

367
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,640
compliance is not security okay if you

368
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,500
could go through the checklist of any

369
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,820
ISO

370
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,600
sit near any of those and and never be

371
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,060
secure you may be compliant but that

372
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,680
doesn't mean that you're secure right so

373
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,620
don't don't become complacent just

374
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,420
because we're compliant

375
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,640
this was just a decent

376
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,980
um slide that shows just how involved

377
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,899
some of those Frameworks are and again

378
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,120
it doesn't mean that you're comply or

379
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,620
excuse me it doesn't mean you're secure

380
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,380
you may be compliant you may be good on

381
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,420
that checklist but it doesn't

382
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,680
necessarily mean that we're anything

383
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,420
close to secure

384
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,519
some of these compliance Frameworks are

385
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,620
a lot more involved than others and may

386
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
take a whole lot more time and again

387
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,500
that may affect your people and

388
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,360
Technology as well right if we have

389
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
people on board that don't know the

390
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,480
compliance framework that we're

391
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,519
following that can obviously cause us a

392
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,720
lot of problems

393
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,760
so just remember compliance is not

394
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,620
security

395
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,700
so that's kind of where we're starting

396
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,320
right if we have a compliance framework

397
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,820
that we're going to follow there's a lot

398
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,920
of checklists there there's plenty of

399
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,300
things to get through and kind of

400
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,279
understand and kind of give us the right

401
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,260
foot but then on top of that there's

402
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,880
industry best practices so again if

403
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
you're in a healthcare industry there's

404
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,680
plenty of other vertical or companies in

405
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,300
that vertical that share information

406
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,480
whether we're talking about thread Intel

407
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,880
iocs local meetups I know places around

408
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,139
here that there's just some of the

409
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,399
bigger corporations that get together

410
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,959
and meet I've been involved with those

411
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,920
so

412
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,899
learn what those best practices are

413
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,399
learn what the technology is that you're

414
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,160
using and how that applies to you and

415
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,560
your organization and apply those on top

416
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,180
of the compliance and framework that

417
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,719
you're already doing

418
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
one of the biggest pieces that that

419
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,600
we've taken from black hat and honestly

420
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,899
I can tell you we've we've learned the

421
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,720
most is from our mistakes and we've

422
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,200
definitely messed up before so

423
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
to Sean's point when he was talking just

424
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
before lunch here about imposter

425
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
syndrome

426
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,320
um

427
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,899
don't don't take a mistake as something

428
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,700
that means you're wrong or that you

429
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,019
don't belong or any of those other

430
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,180
things mistakes are something to be

431
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,220
learned from and I can tell you how many

432
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,779
times grifter and I have messed stuff up

433
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,540
is is most people probably wouldn't

434
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,040
believe it we just hide it really well

435
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,139
or we can we can move on and we've hired

436
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,160
the right people and have the other

437
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,380
processes in place to kind of compensate

438
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,360
for that as well so

439
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,279
um learn your lessons take something

440
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,079
from all those mistakes and and

441
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,699
definitely apply those to what you're

442
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,560
doing in the future

443
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,380
um one quick story is that we

444
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,480
we found technology that that has helped

445
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
us a lot at black hat and kind of what's

446
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,500
helped us is is those technologies have

447
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,180
also provided people so we've gone now

448
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,860
from an open source environment that we

449
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,940
are running so Chris boxes and open BSD

450
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,760
um to now we have vendors in there so

451
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,440
one of the first ones that we had

452
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,620
anybody that might know the story uh

453
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,180
they were a vendor that provided a whole

454
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,040
lot of equipment not just firewalls or

455
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,360
switches they provided everything so it

456
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
was kind of nice for us to be able to go

457
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
to them and ask for everything

458
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,060
one of the processes that that came into

459
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,899
play because of this was uh on stage one

460
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,180
day there was a zero day announced about

461
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,139
this vendor and that next morning before

462
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,360
the trainings kicked off

463
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,459
they decided that they were going to

464
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,459
push a

465
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,480
not fully fledged production

466
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,760
OS firmware update to these APS because

467
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,260
they were scared of the zero day at

468
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,420
black hat and they took the the network

469
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,220
down for about four hours it's one of

470
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,440
the longest outages that we've ever had

471
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,000
but it was one of those things that they

472
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
meant well

473
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
they were concerned about the things

474
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,339
that came out and they tried to do well

475
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,180
and provide a secure environment for us

476
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,560
but nobody talked to us about it because

477
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,600
there's not a chance in hell that I

478
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
would have let him push an update

479
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,540
something that had never been tested

480
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,940
right before training started

481
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,459
so we now have processes and technology

482
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,620
in place because of what those people

483
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,680
did right we now have

484
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,899
our back on all of our role-based access

485
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,600
control on all of our systems they can

486
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,100
get in and make changes in most cases

487
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,079
but they can't commit it there's myself

488
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,699
and a few other guys that can get in and

489
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,260
commit those changes once they've talked

490
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,240
to us explain what they're trying to do

491
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,579
and then we will commit those changes

492
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,160
so again processes come from something

493
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,079
learn from those mistakes it's certainly

494
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,399
something that sucks and it's one of

495
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,300
those things that it was the longest

496
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,120
we've ever taken that Network down

497
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,320
but we've grown from it we've certainly

498
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,300
added pieces to our environment what

499
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,279
we've done because of that mistake and

500
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,259
it was absolutely a mistake on on our

501
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,839
part on their part it was it was just

502
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,680
one of those things that shouldn't

503
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,180
happen right so

504
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,339
learn from those lessons make sure that

505
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,839
you don't beat yourself up over it

506
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,100
you're not an imposter because you made

507
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,959
a mistake just just learn from them and

508
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,720
fix those going forward

509
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,939
so automation I have this in the

510
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,059
processes section obviously there's

511
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,799
there's technology to it but one thing

512
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,900
that I beat on so again I work for net

513
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,319
witness and we sell soar one of the

514
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,579
things that I have conversations with

515
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,380
customers all the time is that

516
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,740
automation does not solve anything

517
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,020
it does not solve your problems that you

518
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,059
need those processes to do it doesn't

519
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,040
solve your people problem

520
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,140
it makes it more efficient you have to

521
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,760
have those processes in place already

522
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,919
before you automate something right

523
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,080
those those processes need to be the

524
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,820
same and repeatable so if we're trying

525
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,080
to automate something that's not the

526
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,340
same and repeatable you're never going

527
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,840
to be able to automate it but then on

528
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,100
top of that

529
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,419
you shouldn't automate everything

530
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,799
anyways right there's plenty of things

531
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
that we can do to get through if there's

532
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
if you get 100 phishing emails a day and

533
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,260
you need to verify if it was clicked on

534
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,179
or if it was valid right

535
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,740
you can automate the majority of that

536
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,179
before you give it to an analyst that

537
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,400
kind of settles what it was and maybe

538
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
what the next step is

539
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
but if you try and automate it without

540
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,260
already having a process in place of

541
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,299
what you're doing for phishing emails or

542
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,039
stolen credentials or whatever the case

543
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,440
is automating it's not going to solve

544
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,360
anything for you so don't get ahead of

545
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,799
yourself in any of these pieces either

546
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,480
right and we'll talk about maturity a

547
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,980
little bit coming up too that I touch on

548
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,000
this but

549
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,980
automation is obviously a big piece to

550
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,440
technology but it ties into processes to

551
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,539
me more than more than anything

552
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,280
automation enables the team it doesn't

553
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,140
replace them and the processes

554
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,520
definitely have to be in place in order

555
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,140
to enable them so so have the other

556
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,720
pieces in place to make yourself more

557
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,860
efficient but it's certainly not

558
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,460
anything that will replace either

559
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,500
so the technology

560
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,480
this one is is an interesting space we

561
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,700
all know how much technology there is

562
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,400
um and it's a crazy world but these are

563
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,500
the tools that provide us uh the

564
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,059
capability to do the work that we're

565
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,480
doing based off those processes right

566
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,059
so how do we select that technology

567
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,400
once again beating the dead horse the

568
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,679
people in processes have to stay aligned

569
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,720
with the ever-changing technology and

570
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,059
more than either of these

571
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,740
in some cases you could probably argue

572
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,299
people in the in the environment but

573
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,580
more than either of these Technologies

574
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,200
probably the one that changes the most

575
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,900
technology is Ever Changing

576
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,940
again to Sean's Point here earlier most

577
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,740
of us have ADHD and that's why I enjoy

578
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,240
this environment right because it always

579
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,620
changes keeps a challenge and there's

580
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,260
there's just ever growing information

581
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,059
um but that can be just as much of a

582
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,059
headache to a sock team a CSO or

583
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:30,960
anything else

584
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm sure you guys have all seen this

585
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,600
there's a cyberscape this is the one

586
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,299
from optiv and again an eye chart

587
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,919
intentionally

588
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,720
those are the technologies that exist

589
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,580
for all the different areas that we need

590
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,220
to protect right your environment may

591
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,500
not need half of these spaces to be

592
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,480
protected but you're gonna have to go in

593
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
even to one of these

594
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,940
areas and decide what technology works

595
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,260
best for you

596
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,820
a lot of that's going to come into play

597
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,320
based on the people that you have hired

598
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,880
a lot of that's going to come into play

599
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,559
based on the processes that you have and

600
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,460
a lot of that's going to come into play

601
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,200
based on what you're trying to

602
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
accomplish as a sock anyways right so so

603
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
take all that into consideration

604
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,440
I would say that the best in breed is

605
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
not always the best

606
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,380
there are plenty of things that it works

607
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,360
well in certain environments

608
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,740
excuse me and especially if you can

609
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,600
afford that right

610
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
but don't feel like if you don't get the

611
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,919
the best in breed in a certain area that

612
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,919
you're insecure that your organization

613
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,740
is incapable there's there's plenty of

614
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,900
people that don't and then even at that

615
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,580
best in breed is certainly a changing

616
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,919
term as well so

617
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,080
um the always changing world of vendor

618
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,660
products becomes very difficult to keep

619
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,780
up with uh and it's it's it's hard to

620
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,280
understand kind of where that is so make

621
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,179
sure that you're taking into

622
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,620
consideration the people you have the

623
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,480
processes you have and what the goal of

624
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
your organization and sock is

625
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,039
so let's talk about open source versus

626
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,140
paid so again one of the big stories

627
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,260
that that I talk about from black hat is

628
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,780
we started using so Chris boxes that's

629
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,980
kind of how the environment started

630
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,419
before we were

631
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,340
grifter was around a lot longer than I

632
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,900
had and even at that there was maybe

633
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,760
four people total that ran that Network

634
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,799
as to where now we have almost 100

635
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,080
people in Vegas that that work at that

636
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
sock

637
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
open source worked for us uh to an

638
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,080
extent right it's limited to things that

639
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,299
you can do the amount of scripts you can

640
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,580
set up the amount of

641
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,740
things that you can be prepared for that

642
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,460
are

643
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,860
in adamantly going to happen right is is

644
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,480
something that comes there's something

645
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,520
to be said for paying a vendor who's

646
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,140
done the work who's built the the

647
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,000
product it works the way it's supposed

648
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,320
to

649
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,480
um and the amount of time that it takes

650
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,520
to even maintain open source in some

651
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
cases can counteract a budget for for

652
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,120
that technology many times

653
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,520
one of the one of the examples and

654
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,780
stories that I've got here is that we've

655
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,480
talked I worked at Tumblr and ran their

656
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,340
Network for a little over a year and

657
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,980
helped migrate them from a million

658
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,380
dollar bill in equinix to their own Data

659
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,500
Center

660
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,299
Tumblr was started by more developers

661
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,460
than it was networking or Security Guys

662
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,580
right and this is an interesting

663
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,860
Dynamic that I've seen multiple times in

664
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,120
startups

665
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,220
the engineers and the developers have

666
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,780
great ideas they've set up this whole

667
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,940
product that

668
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,580
millions of dollars is made off of it

669
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,960
and now all of a sudden they want to

670
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
hire these networking guys to come help

671
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,620
set up and design a data center

672
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,120
environment that they're not necessarily

673
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,100
used to right

674
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,840
some of the conversations that I got in

675
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
with those guys are still to this day

676
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,500
some of the weirdest conversations I had

677
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,659
ever heard we talked about buying load

678
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,520
balancers

679
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,380
and this is not made up I couldn't even

680
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,299
try but one of the guys sat down and

681
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,500
wanted to have a serious conversation

682
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,320
with me and he was one of the developers

683
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,840
and and he said that instead of paying

684
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,100
the money he thought that it would be

685
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,080
great that if we use top of racks which

686
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,720
is an ospf and somehow load balanced

687
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,700
with this it was an insane conversation

688
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,919
that I was just my jaw was on the floor

689
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,659
even trying to understand what he was

690
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,580
saying all of this because they thought

691
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,679
it was better that we don't just go pay

692
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,000
someone why are we paying millions of

693
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,720
dollars to F5 for a load balancer when

694
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,539
when I can balance that load on my own

695
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,700
and there's so many things that go into

696
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,980
that that technology the

697
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,140
the amount of things that have been uh

698
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,760
considered the the environments that

699
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,320
have been gone through it just doesn't

700
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,900
work very often in open source when it's

701
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,820
that big of an environment the other

702
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,200
thing that I talk about with open source

703
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,720
that I've seen many times is we've gone

704
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,840
into as a consultant as a trainer as a

705
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,120
sales guy I've seen uh going into an

706
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,440
environment where they're trying to

707
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,679
replace something and it's a really

708
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,659
terrible time for this team at that

709
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,520
point because there's open source that

710
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,220
was in this case it was an elk stack

711
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,539
that had been set up and maintained by

712
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,940
one guy but the other guys didn't know

713
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,799
how to set up and maintain an elk stack

714
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,600
so when that guy left had better

715
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
opportunities

716
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
they were all kind of scrambling to

717
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,039
figure out how to gain that visibility

718
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,539
if something broke they didn't know how

719
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,580
to do it how to solve that how to fix it

720
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,539
and they were all just kind of

721
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,000
scrambling to fix one thing for basic

722
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,740
visibility right

723
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,780
um on top of of being open source

724
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,520
there's no support of that in most cases

725
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,659
so

726
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,159
um take all those things into

727
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,720
consideration I'm not saying that you

728
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,039
shouldn't use open source there's plenty

729
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,140
of things that that it makes sense for

730
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,179
but again take those things into

731
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,700
consideration and at some point

732
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,980
the cost that it takes to maintain an

733
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,360
open source environment just doesn't

734
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,059
weigh the same as it does to pay for for

735
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,520
a solution

736
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,320
um the ability to execute so again tying

737
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,880
back into the people that we have so if

738
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,380
we don't have the people somebody leaves

739
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,059
and we can't execute on that environment

740
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,740
that stack make sure that it stays

741
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,720
maintained and provides the value that

742
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,340
it was intended to

743
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,940
um

744
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
that's a problem the biggest thing that

745
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,240
I would say about open source is it's

746
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,760
not free right open source is not free

747
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,980
the product may be free but you're going

748
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,480
to take man hours you're going to take

749
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,799
development hours you're going to take

750
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,940
support hours you're going to take

751
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,059
troubleshooting hours that just isn't

752
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,500
the same when you pay for that have

753
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,780
support now again weigh those costs

754
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,980
maybe you have somebody that's cheap

755
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,900
enough does it well enough and you're

756
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,179
confident will be around as long as that

757
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,640
organization exists and can run it it's

758
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,659
just something to take into

759
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,640
consideration

760
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
so again the maintenance on on what that

761
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,740
technology is this isn't necessarily

762
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,500
just paying for support you have to have

763
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,120
people that are maintaining that

764
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,159
solution if there's an upgrade because

765
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,380
there was a zero day or or a bug and

766
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,760
something else that needs to be solved

767
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,100
there is maintenance that goes into any

768
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,320
product right make sure you have the

769
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,960
people and the processes to maintain

770
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,000
that technology

771
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,799
um

772
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,620
to Jason's Street Point the other day

773
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,720
low hanging fruit isn't there's no use

774
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
to going after the low-hanging fruit if

775
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,419
there's fruit all over on the ground

776
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,360
right so if we're not patching devices

777
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,299
it's more worrisome than uh running the

778
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,620
latest and greatest and having the best

779
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,299
in breed technology if you can't keep up

780
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,580
on on just patching your ends your your

781
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,919
end users workstations

782
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,980
understand the technology road map of of

783
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,900
what it is that you have implemented so

784
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,640
again if you have a technology that's

785
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,460
implemented let's say packet visibility

786
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,340
a Sim anything like that know what their

787
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,679
roadmap is as an organization I've been

788
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,140
in many situations where people were

789
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,220
caught off guard but it was something

790
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,980
had been talked about for months that a

791
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,380
solution was going to move to and then

792
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,539
you have really angry customers really

793
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,340
angry sales guys and it's just

794
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,320
frustrating when it was communicated and

795
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,880
somebody didn't stay on top of it now

796
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
it's everybody else's fault right so

797
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,360
make sure that you're aware of what that

798
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,940
technology looks like where it's going

799
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,200
and what you need it to accomplish in

800
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,419
your your environment

801
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,220
and on top of that just keep up with

802
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,419
industry Trends again we talked about

803
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,419
best practices keeping up with iocs

804
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,580
keeping up with the security world uh

805
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,279
Twitter seems to be the news place for

806
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,659
for this industry which is interesting

807
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,179
but uh I you don't see me talking on

808
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,460
there much but I am very

809
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,220
involved reading lurking and kind of

810
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,539
understanding what's going on in the

811
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,980
industry at least

812
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,380
so stay on top of all that

813
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,059
and then again providing the overall

814
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,880
balance of that technology what is it

815
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,020
that we're trying to get out of this

816
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,820
technology

817
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,940
um what is it that we need to accomplish

818
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,340
with this in our environment is it

819
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,200
something that we have the people to

820
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
provide that value or is it again and

821
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,140
we're just going to pay for this we're

822
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,340
not going to be able to implement it for

823
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,140
six months we're going to be angry when

824
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,000
those renewals come up and and not get

825
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,260
the value that we needed out of that

826
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,760
Technology based on the processes and

827
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,799
people that we had in place

828
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,840
the value comes from the usability and

829
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,240
the integration of that technology so

830
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,100
the other piece within technology and

831
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,140
again finding that balance is making

832
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,059
sure that these pieces of Technology

833
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,260
work together if we have a firewall that

834
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,720
doesn't firewall or doesn't feed data to

835
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,539
our Sim or doesn't it doesn't provide

836
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,100
the value that we need that's a problem

837
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,720
no matter what the technology is right

838
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,900
there's no reason to implement a laugh

839
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
if you're only website is an intranet

840
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,860
you know there's there's different

841
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,840
things and I've seen I've seen all of

842
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,380
that right new shiny toy shows up uh and

843
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,059
and they find a reason to buy it and use

844
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,559
it that's that's not always the case and

845
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,880
should be something that is certainly

846
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,179
vetted and put into the environment with

847
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:25,100
with an intent and not just thrown in

848
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,900
so maturity

849
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,140
um based off the current capabilities uh

850
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,059
build off of your current capabilities

851
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,039
excuse me and don't get distracted from

852
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,020
the purpose of your sock so again

853
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,820
the type of organization you're in what

854
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,380
you're trying to do and what that means

855
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,440
to you is all coming into one big piece

856
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,700
here

857
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,020
there are a whole different bunch of

858
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,700
sock maturity models that you can kind

859
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,039
of look at follow

860
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,779
um

861
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,340
that I like to talk about this from from

862
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,380
a few different angles I think a lot of

863
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,299
cases people get ahead of themselves

864
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,020
this one I believe is from Accenture

865
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,760
again all kinds of different security or

866
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,679
sock maturity models that that kind of

867
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,240
play into where those Technologies

868
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,980
should fit based on your maturity right

869
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
we've talked about

870
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,580
um people processing technology and

871
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,700
through all of that there is a maturity

872
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,159
of what each of those provides providing

873
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,659
that balance if we get way ahead of

874
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,159
ourselves again

875
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,220
with threat hunters or with specific

876
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,659
technology we don't have the people or

877
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,700
the process in place you can absolutely

878
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,679
stumble and fall and cause yourself more

879
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,980
headache than than anything else

880
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,899
um the maturity model is is interesting

881
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,539
to kind of to follow and break down uh

882
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,399
based on different things that that

883
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,580
we've done at black hat as well again

884
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,179
the uh where we started was

885
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,760
basically more of a network we're not a

886
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,860
sock it's a it's a knock is what we call

887
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,240
it and that's for different reasons we

888
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,279
provide more of a stable Network as our

889
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,320
main goal but there's plenty of security

890
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
in the registration data that that we're

891
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,919
there for as well but we wouldn't get

892
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,480
ahead of ourselves trying to provide

893
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
again while we had the open source data

894
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,320
had no tap or a way to get the

895
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,700
visibility or wouldn't necessarily

896
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,799
brought in a packet visibility tool

897
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,659
right

898
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:11,399
so all along the way finding the balance

899
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,440
but again kind of not getting ahead of

900
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,460
yourself making sure that we're

901
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,320
following the road map and and staying

902
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,440
on plan is all a big piece of what we're

903
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,600
trying to do being reactive versus

904
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,020
proactive through here again provides

905
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,279
um kind of a level of what you're

906
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,500
looking for and what technology people

907
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,559
in process we're looking for

908
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,419
rolled through this pretty quick but

909
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,120
we'll uh kind of wrap this up so make

910
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,039
intentional decisions and stay true to

911
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,179
what the goals and purpose of the

912
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,880
environment that you're in are so

913
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,520
again threat hunting the technology the

914
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,500
people the processes any of those if you

915
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,059
put it ahead of yourself and don't have

916
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,860
the other pieces in place to balance

917
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,179
that out and provide the information

918
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,880
that you're trying to get it's it's not

919
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,559
going to be what you're looking for so

920
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,659
finding that balance and staying on top

921
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,580
of what you're doing in your environment

922
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,260
is all kind of the key to what you're

923
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,720
looking for and building that out

924
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,820
that's all I've got for today so any

925
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,059
questions

926
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,919
perfect

927
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,290
thanks guys

928
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:20,319
