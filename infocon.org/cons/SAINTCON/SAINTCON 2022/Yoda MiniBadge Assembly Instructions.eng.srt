00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,080
all right welcome to the tutorial for

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,639
the yoda mini badge

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,559
this here is the yoda mini badge it's

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
one of the ones that i've created

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,480
and if you're lucky enough to get your

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,320
hands on one it's probably one of the

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
coolest badges you'll see at sync con

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,279
i'm not biased at all

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
we're going to go through the assembly

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,680
process

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
let's get started

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,519
let's get everything outside out of the

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,840
bag here

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,920
all right

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
inside of the bag

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,360
are the assembly instructions which is

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
nothing more than

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
a note for you to come and find this

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
video

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
you can find it on youtube saying khan

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,800
channel

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,399
we're highly recommending that you

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
follow these instructions

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
to prevent issues with the led filament

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
so while i'm setting that aside let's

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,239
talk about the led filament here it is

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,640
this is the led filament it's actually

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
inside of this paper tube and it's kind

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
of a rigid thing to protect it because

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
that led filament is super fragile

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,119
in its just raw state we're going to set

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
this aside and attach that almost last

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
other things inside the baggie the pcb

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
of mr yoda himself

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
so you can kind of see it's a green pcb

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
and that's the front side shows the yoda

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,240
on the back side it has a star wars logo

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
and you can see positions

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
for

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
leds and other things i'll just point

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
them out so there's an led position up

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,880
at the top

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
another one here on his shoulder and

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
another one down here by his feet these

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,280
uh provide back lighting for the mini

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
badge in the center here grouped

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
together are two led or sorry two

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,119
resistor pads and we're gonna attach the

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,759
resistors first here in just a moment

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
the rest of the things inside of the

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
baggie there's three of these two

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
position

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
uh header pins

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
there's two resistors now depending on

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
which yoda you get you might get one

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
that has red

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
on both positions or you might have one

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
that's a red and a green and those will

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
correspond to the red indicator or the

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
green indicator here but if you have one

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
that has

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
both red you put one in both positions

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
and it doesn't matter at all

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
lastly there's three leds and these are

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,879
the ones that do the back lighting

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
effect on the yoda we're gonna go

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
through on how to attach those here in

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
just a minute so what we're gonna do is

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
go ahead and get started in order to

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
assemble we want to pull out the

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
resistors first i always find resistors

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
are the easiest to get installed and

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
kind of set the pace for what we're

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
doing

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
i'm just going to pull those resistors

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
out of this package and set them on the

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
table here

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
this is the first time you've ever done

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
something like this you'll notice that

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
these resistors are super tiny little

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,319
components in fact i'm going to zoom the

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
camera right down here

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
so you can even kind of barely see the

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
fact that they exist

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
the leds here are also very small

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,760
they're physically about the same size

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
but we're going to go ahead and show you

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
how to attach those the best way to

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
attach

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,040
a resistor or any other component that's

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
smd is to do one side at a time and so

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
what we're going to do is we're going to

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,959
um

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
start tinning

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
one side of each one of these components

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
and we're going to start with the

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
resistor so right here in the center

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
there is i'm going to add just a tiny

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
bit of solder to one side of that pad

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
and just for good measure i'm going to

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
add just a little bit there

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
and what you can see here is that now

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
i've got those pads

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
and one side has a little blob of solder

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,120
so i'm going to take

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
one of these resistors

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
resistors do not have polarity and so

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
they can go in whatever orientation you

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,319
want them to

110
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
and i'm just going to set it

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
right here on top

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
so that it's bridging that blob and the

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
side that does not have a blob on it i'm

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
gonna see if i can get this down just a

115
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
little bit closer and make that a little

116
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,319
easier to see

117
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,680
the lighting effect might be a little

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
rough but

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,079
i'll move this over here

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
and i'm just going to set that resistor

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
right here and once i have it in place

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,919
i'm just going to rest the closed

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,479
tweezers on top

124
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
and i'm just going to heat up the solder

125
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
on this side and you'll feel this

126
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
resistor sink

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,040
underneath of the tweezers and now that

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
particular resistor is attached on one

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
side i'm going to grab this other one

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
we're just going to repeat the process

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,479
so i'm going to set it across the two

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
bridges here

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
about where i want it i'm going to hold

134
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,759
just a tiny bit of pressure on top while

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,280
i heat that solder

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
and that resistor is just going to sink

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
right down in there

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479
and now what we'll see

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
is that it's attached

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
on one side and not the other and so to

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
finish up the attachment i'm going to

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
put it in this orientation it's a little

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
easier for me

144
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
and i'm going to take this little angel

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,080
hair solder

146
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
and i'm just going to put

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,759
it up against the component and i'm just

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,320
going to heat it with the iron

149
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
and that's as much as you need right

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
there is just a tiny little bit of

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
solder

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
and that'll complete

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
the connection

154
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
on the other side so no now those

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,759
resistors

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
are in place and ready to go

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,759
so what we're going to do is the exact

158
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
same process

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,759
but with each one of the three leds and

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
so in order to prepare that

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,479
i'm going to take the pads i'm just

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
going to put a little blob on that pad

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
on that pad

164
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,240
and on that pad to get things ready then

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
i'm going to take the leds here i'm

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
going to grab my tweezers

167
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
and i'm just going to

168
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,360
see if i can nestle that underneath that

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
plastic

170
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
and pull these leds out you have to be

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
kind of careful to not pull or snap them

172
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
or they'll fly all over the place and

173
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
i'm just going to lay these onto the

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,039
table

175
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,240
and we're going to take a real quick

176
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
look at these because

177
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
leds do have a polarity and it's

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
important that they're put

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
in the right direction

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,880
or they won't work properly

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
and so it might be kind of hard to see

182
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
but i'm going to pick one of these up

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
and i'm going to show you

184
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
what that looks like underneath if you

185
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
can see that you'll see a line with a

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,680
little bit of a nub and that nub points

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
to the negative side

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
of the circuit

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
uh and on this yota badge the negative

190
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
side is on the right hand side and so

191
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
you want the nub that you can see right

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
here to point to the blob of solder that

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
i've put down here on the right hand

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
side and so in order to do that i got to

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
kind of turn this thing over

196
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,840
and put the top part of the led facing

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,880
up

198
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
the nub is facing to the right

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
and i'm going to grab that led

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
and i'm going to heat

201
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
this blob of solder and i'm just going

202
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
to slide

203
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
that led into it

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
and then i'm going to rest

205
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
the

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,199
tweezers on top and i'm just going to

207
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,680
heat that up one more time to make sure

208
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
it's flushly mounted to the board

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
so next led over here again it's kind of

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
hard to see but

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
the nub is going to face right and so

212
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,759
i've got to just turn this over

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
so i'm going to turn it like that i'll

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
set it on the board

215
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
get another bite at it

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
and i'm just going to hold it heat this

217
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,880
solder and i'm going to slide that led

218
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
into it and you'll notice on this one

219
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,639
this happens sometimes

220
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
that that led is raised off the edge

221
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
because when you're holding the tweezers

222
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
it's kind of hard to keep it flat

223
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
and so the way you fix that is you just

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
rest the tweezers on top you're not

225
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
putting a ton of pressure you're just

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
heating that little blob of solder again

227
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
and you'll feel

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
the led will sink

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
right back down flush

230
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,599
onto there and again we're just doing

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,199
one side of each one of these leds at

232
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,199
the moment

233
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,560
last led

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
this one's nub is facing to the right

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
and so i've actually got to flip it over

236
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
like this

237
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
and i'll set it on the board

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,319
and i'll re-grab it to make it a little

239
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
easier okay and we just knocked it out

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
of place and so we better verify which

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
direction it's supposed to be again

242
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
because you it's hard to tell on the top

243
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
so

244
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,039
the nub here is facing

245
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
that way and so now i'm just going to

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
turn it over and face it back the way

247
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
that i want it to go

248
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
sometimes they're a little finicky

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
but i'm going to grab the tweezers

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
and again last time i'm going to

251
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,880
push that into the solder blob

252
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
and then i'm just gonna rest my tweezers

253
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,680
on top nice and gently

254
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
and i'm gonna finish up

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
soldering that down

256
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
and then to finalize each one of those

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
three components

258
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
i'm just going to take

259
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
some of this solder

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,880
and i'm just going to put a tiny little

261
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
piece up against the edge where i want

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,080
the solder to be and i'm just going to

263
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
touch it with the iron

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,399
and it'll complete that connection for

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
all three

266
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
of these there's just a miniscule amount

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
of solder that's necessary here if

268
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,560
you're putting a ton on there

269
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,320
um it'll it'll blob up and it'll make it

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
you know it'll potentially burn up the

271
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
the leds so be a little bit careful it

272
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,519
doesn't take very much

273
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
and so now i've got the two resistors

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,959
and the three

275
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
back side leds on here and so we're

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,080
ready now to actually install

277
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,040
the lightsaber for our little yoda and

278
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
so to do that i'm going to

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
kind of zoom us out just a little bit so

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,560
we can see a little bit better here

281
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
this again is the led filament the

282
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
little green line here indicates which

283
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
color of led filaments in there this

284
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,839
one's green it's the most common but

285
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
there are blue and pink

286
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,720
uh red

287
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
and maybe even some other colors out

288
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
there some are a little bit more rare

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,519
than others

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
and they're given out randomly so it's

291
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,079
not like you get the one you want or

292
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,240
whatever okay so inside of here is an

293
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
led filament i've opened up that in with

294
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,959
some tweezers and i'm just going to kind

295
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,480
of shake it out

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
these are very fragile meaning that if

297
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
you bend it like this

298
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
it'll snap and it'll break and it won't

299
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
work anymore

300
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
a couple of other things to note about

301
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
this led filament is on one side here

302
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
you'll see a hole

303
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,680
in the

304
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
piece of metal on one side and you'll

305
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
see no hole on the other

306
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
so we're just going to reference the

307
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
side of the hole

308
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,120
and i'm just going to have you kind of

309
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
hold it to reinforce it and you're just

310
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
going to bend

311
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
that

312
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,360
down

313
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
right there at that hole if you bend it

314
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,440
back and forth too much it will break

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
off and that's not what you're going to

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
want so you're going to just bend it

317
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
down and leave it in that position and

318
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,680
then on the other end you're going to do

319
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,279
the exact same thing

320
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
in the exact same direction so it's

321
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
going to point the same way just

322
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,120
reinforce it and just kind of grab that

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,279
and bend it down so that you've got both

324
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,480
of those facing the same direction

325
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,160
okay then we're going to take the end

326
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
with the hole the top

327
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
and we're going to stick it on the top

328
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
part of the lightsaber for the yoda so

329
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
it's going to go in the top

330
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
and then the bottom side

331
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
will fit into that hole

332
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
and then the point is to kind of get it

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
to where it mounts itself flush

334
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
to the pcb

335
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
once it's there it's a whole lot more

336
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,560
stable and it the there's a much

337
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
less or there's much less chance you're

338
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
going to break that filament

339
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
so we're going to turn it over and we're

340
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
going to solder that filament on the

341
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
back side and that's done by just

342
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
connecting solder here

343
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,880
and connecting solder here

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,160
and then once those are done

345
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
we want to make sure that that filament

346
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,279
is resting

347
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
or snug to the board again that keeps it

348
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,440
from breaking because the pcb is

349
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,839
actually quite rigid and so after that

350
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
he's not going to break it's pretty

351
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,639
pretty

352
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,680
robust

353
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
last thing to do is to put the header

354
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,399
pins on

355
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
and so i generally use like an extender

356
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,600
board

357
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
or my badge or whatever to do this it

358
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
makes it a lot easier to hold all these

359
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,959
things in position i'm going to stick

360
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,760
these headers with the long ends down in

361
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
this configuration so on the two on the

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
left hand side and the one on the top

363
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,079
on the right hand side this one only

364
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,880
takes three sets instead of four

365
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,639
and i'm gonna rest the yoda

366
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,880
in each one of those and i'm gonna take

367
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,320
a moment

368
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
and i'm gonna solder each one of these

369
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,439
connections

370
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,160
so that it's connected to the board

371
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,680
and once it's connected this mini badge

372
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
is complete

373
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
meaning that you should light up and

374
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
work in fact i've got a little power

375
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
board right here and let's go ahead and

376
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
just test it

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
so i'm going to bring this down here and

378
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
if we put this in here

379
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
our yoda should

380
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,760
immediately start

381
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
lighting up well and actually he's not

382
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
quite in the right position

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
so there he goes

384
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
and so what he is he's got a red

385
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
backlight and he's got a green

386
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,160
lightsaber

387
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
i'll turn these lights out here maybe to

388
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,239
make this a little bit easier to see

389
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,720
and so there is your yoda mini badge

390
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
and it wouldn't be fun if you didn't

391
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
have a couple of friends and so just to

392
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,519
kind of show you here's the blue version

393
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
which has color changing leds

394
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
those are pretty rare

395
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
uh here's a red version

396
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,680
or actually that's the pink version of

397
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
the yoda this backlit with red leds and

398
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,399
there's also a red version and i don't

399
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
know if it'll fit in here but

400
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
yoda's got a couple of friends

401
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,920
and there is the yoda mini badge for

402
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,079
sync con 2022 hope you enjoy
