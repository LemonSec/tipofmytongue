1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,860
big crowd

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,500
awesome topic yeah

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,660
highlight of my career I get to speak

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,599
about an acronym

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,960
PCI DSS so um

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
we'll go ahead and get started I'm sure

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
you know a thousand people will come in

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
a little later

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,800
but um

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
excited to be here thankful for Saint

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,180
Khan for letting me speak a little bit

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,260
and uh

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,439
we're going to be talking today on um

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,960
this thing called PCI DSS for the

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,899
uninitiated PCI stands for payment card

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,020
industry and DSs is data security

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,620
standard so

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,559
if you're in the wrong room then

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,079
you're in the wrong room right

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
hopefully not

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,039
so who is this guy and why should you

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,600
listen to me

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,120
um I'm Gary Glover I work at a company

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,100
called security metrics here in the

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,879
valley

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
and um

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,660
so I've been doing cyber security for

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,460
about 18 years working for security

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,979
metrics for that whole time January will

30
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,320
be my 19th year at security metrics so

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,820
just a little bit of time here working

32
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,400
with the payment card industry and with

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,700
data security and stuff like that so

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,060
before that I was a developer a software

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,939
developer for 10 years I worked for a

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,759
small company called Novell and then

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
um another company called Corda which is

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,820
now Domo maybe people have heard of Domo

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,200
here in the valley

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,340
so

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
at

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
Novell I wrote printed all the printer

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,180
driver download code for netware so if

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,560
anybody even remembers what a printer

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,200
driver is then then you're old like me

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
before that for seven years I was a

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,220
mechanical engineer at an aerospace

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,259
company called McDonald Douglas worked

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,659
on things like space station Mars Rover

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,180
single stage to orbit

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,740
um did a little antimatter propulsion

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,860
research stuff like that so this is my

53
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,439
third career hopefully this one sticks

54
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,000
till the end that's what I'm hoping for

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
right

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
so that's who I am

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,380
um

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,540
this is who I work for security metrics

59
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,420
we're we've been around since 2000.

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,720
and we do lots of different things

61
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,220
security assessments and Consulting and

62
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,020
penetration testing those are the areas

63
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,060
that I'm involved with as security

64
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,319
metrics

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,780
and digital forensics we also do

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,840
vulnerability assessment

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
scanning so we we're an ASV an

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,360
authorized scan vendor in the PCI the

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
payment card space

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
um we also do some managed security

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,319
services so that would be things like

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,239
managing people's firewalls small

73
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,760
Merchant firewalls things like that also

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,819
some internal scanning of internal

75
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,040
vulnerability scanning appliances things

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,220
like that we also then also work with

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,260
security compliance programs which would

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,900
be us working with really you know

79
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,760
hundreds of thousands of small companies

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,379
helping them

81
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,660
fill out self-assessment questionnaires

82
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,040
answer

83
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,819
um

84
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,860
uh there's look at their scans answer

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,300
questions about their scans stuff like

86
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,980
that so that's kind of what security

87
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,220
metrics does we do that for kind of PCI

88
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,940
HIPAA glba or I mean gdpr

89
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,980
things like that so that's a little bit

90
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,599
on security metrics we're kind of right

91
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,819
at 1600 North right by the freeway you

92
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,500
might have seen our building

93
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,720
there

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
so a little bit more about kind of me

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,640
and my PCI DSS background why am I here

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,500
speaking on this why did Saint Khan have

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,959
me come to speak to all you people I

98
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,659
kind of started doing PCI before it even

99
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,080
existed there was a program called cisp

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,840
which is a Visa program card Brands had

101
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,879
their own kind of data Security Programs

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,680
before that

103
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,900
um then pcid ss1.0 came around

104
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,000
and that was a result of the card Brands

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
actually trying to play nice together

106
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,239
which they typically don't do very well

107
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,000
and so they got together came up with a

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
common set of security standards and

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
started a PCI DSS

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,180
and you know it's been a little bit more

111
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,220
structured as time goes on back in the

112
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,959
early days it was kind of cowboy-ish you

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
just sort of wrote whatever you wanted

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,500
and and the assessment was a little more

115
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,360
open now they're getting a little bit

116
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,060
more tight on some of those things as

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,520
far as that the card Brands formed

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,860
something called the PCI Council which

119
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,960
is a group that actually manages the

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,680
standard itself kind of a standards body

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,860
and they're made up of of independent

122
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,020
people and then the card brands have

123
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,300
some representation on the PCI Council

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
so that's a little bit about where that

125
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,139
comes from but it's changing over time

126
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,580
it's a good thing we'll talk a little

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,620
bit more about that uh over the years

128
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,120
I've been a member of a lot of different

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,479
task forces in the payment card space

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,479
small Merchant task forces and

131
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,460
encryption and cloud computing and

132
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,120
penetration testing special interest

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,340
groups and

134
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,419
um

135
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,040
you know all kinds of different things

136
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,680
over the years currently I'm a member of

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,720
the PCI council's gear which is the

138
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
global assessor Global executive

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,240
assistant round table which allows us as

140
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
PCI assessors and cyber Security

141
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,560
Professionals to give some feedback to

142
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,419
the PCI Council themselves rather than

143
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,960
them just trying to make up rules in the

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
cloud or in in this Ivory Tower so we're

145
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,460
able to feed back to them some of the

146
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,020
real stuff that's happening out in

147
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,120
industry

148
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,180
um the last one is why do I like PCI DSS

149
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,100
hold your Tomatoes I'm sure it's not

150
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,199
always a really fun topic for a lot of

151
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,539
people there are some really good things

152
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,580
I think about it as far as standards go

153
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,860
there's a number of security Frameworks

154
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,720
out there

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,380
um

156
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,460
in the world HIPAA and high trust and

157
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,639
fedramp and those kind of things

158
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,780
PCI is one of the standards that

159
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,880
actually has some enforcement in place

160
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
and people actually are kind of looking

161
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
at compliance

162
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,020
um to that so I think over the last 19

163
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,000
years there has been some improvement in

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,820
Security in that industry for sure plus

165
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,740
it's just a good kind of collection of

166
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,419
of really good data security things

167
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,819
there's 12 areas and they're pretty

168
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,620
common across any kind of a security

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,060
framework

170
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,979
so

171
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,000
um

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
you know kind of at the end of the year

173
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,340
it's nice to feel like hey I've

174
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,319
was able to help a lot of people I was

175
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,000
able to see lots of different networks I

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
was able to

177
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,539
um uh get a lot of experience

178
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,100
it's not a perfect standard

179
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,960
but it's something that's moving forward

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
I think so

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,460
it's not really a fun process compliance

182
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,199
is really not a fun process to really be

183
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,500
in but it is what it is

184
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,880
so a little bit about what we're going

185
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,319
to be doing today

186
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,580
um

187
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,720
we're going to do a little quick

188
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,880
background on PCI DSS as far as history

189
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,400
goes some characteristics of the new

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,060
Ford auto changes maybe some timelines

191
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,039
now kind of the topic what should you be

192
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,460
doing now what's next some of the top 10

193
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,319
changes we won't go over all the changes

194
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,180
but some of the main changes that I

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,940
think are going to be most

196
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,120
effect you know affect most people

197
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,740
customized approach is a new kind of way

198
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,380
of validating compliance and this is a

199
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,300
do or do not kind of a thing you know do

200
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,680
you want to use that we'll talk about

201
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,039
what what that means and and sum up kind

202
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,660
of some of the immediate changes wrap up

203
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,580
and then have time for QA if if there is

204
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,380
any time for that

205
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,400
um

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,160
so before we do that I I sort of just

207
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,360
wanted to get an idea how many people

208
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,120
have heard of PCI DSS before

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,160
so I'll look everybody here in the

210
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,960
audience that's great that's probably

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,180
why you're here right

212
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,960
um

213
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,280
how many of you have been audited before

214
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
so we got

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,259
a few so how many have been audited uh

216
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,120
twice

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,500
hold up your hands you've been audited

218
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,240
more than once anybody one guy back

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,380
there two

220
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,880
twice three times

221
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,860
four times

222
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,539
five times

223
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,060
so four times so you guys both had four

224
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,960
times right so hold up your hands again

225
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,940
so just to give back to the community I

226
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,259
have some socks for you guys who have

227
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,260
been audited more than four times

228
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,419
so Winnie

229
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,760
help me out there

230
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,380
Winnie is my beautiful assistant she's

231
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,179
gonna pass out the socks to those guys

232
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,860
with her hands up was there three did

233
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,339
you have three

234
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,019
here's another one

235
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,620
oh

236
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,060
all right here's another one so that's

237
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,040
cool how many um

238
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,839
how long who's been in cyber security

239
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,019
the longest so how many have been in

240
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,140
cyber security for five years

241
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,720
okay 10 years

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,160
I can't see very good uh 15 years

243
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,959
20 years

244
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
wait is that every oh there's one guy

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,100
still 22 22 23 20. so what was 20 again

246
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,160
we got two guys 20. wait are you one of

247
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,440
the guys that won the socks too

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,980
so one other guy all right here's one

249
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,160
so if you won socks you you know I think

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
weren't you the guy who actually called

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,060
it cyber security is that what you're

252
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,260
the guy

253
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,060
so those two guys that have been in for

254
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,160
over 20 to 20 years we've got some

255
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,839
T-shirts for you if those are the wrong

256
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,339
size you can go to our booth and

257
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,560
exchange them

258
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,760
so

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,620
um interesting you know so it's a it's

260
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,880
this is something that's really been

261
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,920
along around for a long time PCI DSS

262
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,760
compliance and um

263
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,459
um you know kind of all fun aside I

264
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,320
think really you probably feel better

265
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,060
when you get through this process it's

266
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,220
nasty it's not necessarily fun but you

267
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,019
probably feel a little bit better it's a

268
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,519
big accomplishment

269
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,779
um

270
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,600
so let's move on here so this is the

271
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,240
little quick history lesson December 20

272
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,959
2004 was the first version of PCI DSS I

273
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,140
started in January of 2005. so just kind

274
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,839
of right in there at the time they had

275
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,279
barely come out with it I think really

276
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,959
nobody knew about it until January of

277
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,339
2005. that was 1.0 2.0 was October of

278
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,100
2010 so that's kind of a five years Gap

279
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,080
there

280
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,560
3.0 was 2013 three years three two one

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
may 2018. there's you know some versions

282
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,779
in between there you can tell you know

283
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,880
three two came out and then three two

284
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,620
one came out right after it because of

285
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,560
some SSL certificate challenges

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,839
um so you know not everybody is perfect

287
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,760
and the standard evolves and that's a

288
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,980
good thing and then 4.0 came out this

289
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,200
year in April 2022 it really hasn't

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
changed a whole lot as far as there's 12

291
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,100
main areas of the security

292
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,220
controls those are the same

293
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,860
and it's just been changed throughout

294
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,779
this time period to keep up with the

295
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,300
industry Bad actors new technology

296
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,680
etc etc

297
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,720
so there's the history lesson here's

298
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,000
some quick stats on 4.0

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,060
there are 53 new requirements that will

300
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,519
apply to everybody who who undertakes to

301
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,700
be compliant to PCI DSS now that sounds

302
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,019
pretty amazing that sounds like a lot

303
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,740
out of 353 are are new

304
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,540
I don't know that they're new there may

305
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,760
be they may actually a lot of them are

306
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,560
kind of similar to the last version

307
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,600
requirements that they're adding maybe a

308
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,360
new aspect so it's not like there's you

309
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,740
know the council sat around and said

310
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,060
what how could we screw up people let's

311
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,579
think of 53 totally new things that

312
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,140
nobody will have any idea of what to do

313
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,339
and then we'll give them a couple years

314
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,480
and see if they can figure it out right

315
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,660
I mean that's not not really the idea so

316
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,399
most of them will be fairly familiar

317
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,279
there'll just be some kind of changes to

318
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,100
how they're validated for example 11 new

319
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,480
requirements that will apply just to

320
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,220
service providers alone

321
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,339
and then 13 of that total the 53 plus 11

322
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,200
are things that are effective

323
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,060
immediately and we'll go kind of through

324
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,899
a few of those later

325
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,660
so what are the characteristics of fordo

326
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,339
you can see that our slide helper here

327
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,560
is super happy about the changes that

328
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,540
have been made in 4.0 as all of you are

329
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,700
I can see everybody smiling about all

330
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,120
the changes that are coming in PCI 40.

331
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
um the requirements are a little bit

332
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,060
redesigned to focus on security

333
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,519
objectives again not a whole lot of

334
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,180
change as far as topics and controls but

335
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,440
they're reorganized a little bit

336
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
reworded a bit

337
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,040
to focus on objectives we're changing

338
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,040
from what you must do to what the

339
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,620
resulting security should be for for

340
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,120
that kind of a record for that

341
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,260
requirement

342
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,420
the changes were really made with a lot

343
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,579
of Industry feedback over the course of

344
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,540
their rfcs the requests for comments the

345
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,760
council actually went through 6

346
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,440
000

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,339
feedback items and they went through

348
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,899
every one of them and a lot of them were

349
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,000
from people you know that are actually

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
doing audits a lot of them for people

351
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,839
that are are conducting those audits a

352
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,120
lot of them are from from other areas so

353
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
6 000 is a lot of things so people

354
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,600
really got quite involved in the

355
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,720
development of this so it's not just

356
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,339
some you know Council of eight people

357
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,800
sitting in a closed room and waiting to

358
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,279
figure out you know how to how to change

359
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
the world and then and then when they're

360
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
done they let the smoke loose and people

361
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
know that there's a new a new standard

362
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,860
right it's like choosing a new pope so

363
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,420
it's not like that they really have

364
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,740
looked at a lot of feedback from

365
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,240
industry

366
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
a lot of the changes are clarifications

367
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,100
and again very familiar they've just

368
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,279
making a clarification in something

369
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,139
all the changes are not immediate

370
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,779
there are many of them that are future

371
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,700
data that they give more time and we'll

372
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,220
talk about some of those going up

373
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,360
um

374
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,639
there's lots of transition time these

375
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,639
future data changes don't really come

376
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,459
until 2025 we'll look at that but again

377
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,579
no real basic there's no changes to the

378
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,200
basic principles

379
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,060
so let's look at kind of the timeline I

380
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,959
don't know if you can see that very well

381
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,060
but

382
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,940
um first part of this year Q2 been the

383
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,980
beginning of Q2 they released

384
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,720
um 4.0

385
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,700
then

386
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,760
4.0 kind of is introduced during this

387
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,459
last year to people right we as a qsa

388
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,800
company we haven't done one 4.0 audit in

389
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,839
the last since April so nobody's really

390
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,420
just jumping right in and saying sign me

391
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,220
up now one thing we did get from

392
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,959
somebody one of our qsa assessors

393
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,220
actually got a a an attestation of

394
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,740
compliance for 4.0 even before anyone

395
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,079
was able to be audited by 4.0 so that

396
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,240
was actually pretty cool so they just

397
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
decided to download the AOC form fill it

398
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,560
out as if they were compliant

399
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,160
um

400
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,380
we quickly figured that out because we

401
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,120
hadn't we weren't even allowed to

402
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,279
conduct one of those audits yet

403
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,860
but anyway there's about a year you know

404
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,600
there's there's from there's a two-year

405
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
transition period from April 2022 to

406
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,040
March 31st 2024 you can see there where

407
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,839
that's the transition period between

408
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,120
three two one the current version and

409
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
4.0 321 is still something that's viable

410
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,620
you can still fill that out you can

411
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,540
still use that as a standard still a

412
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,620
good standard

413
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,959
and then another year past that clear

414
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,680
into March 31st of 2025 is the time when

415
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,560
the new new requirements that are future

416
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,199
data have to be implemented so

417
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,600
in March of 2025 you have to have all

418
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,980
those things implemented if you are

419
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,800
assessed after that time for the for the

420
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,620
new requirements that are future dated

421
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,959
so

422
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,579
um

423
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,380
so it's not you know it's not like it's

424
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,820
coming immediately but it's also not

425
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,260
time to just totally relax and say well

426
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,940
I got till 2025 I don't have to think

427
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,160
about this let's go back to be doing the

428
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,199
normal stuff that we do

429
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,820
um let's hope we can get through our

430
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,839
next

431
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,880
audit right so you should be really

432
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,079
thinking about that we're going to talk

433
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,639
a little bit more about some ideas of

434
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,279
what you can be doing here soon so and

435
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,779
that's right next what should be what

436
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,519
should you do first

437
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,560
you know I think most people's first

438
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,779
reaction is to complain

439
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,279
so go ahead complain get that out

440
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,560
yeah thank you very much what do you

441
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
think let's let's give me something give

442
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,899
me some yeah

443
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,699
because it's not going away

444
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,800
unfortunately right so it's okay to

445
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,259
complain it's okay to think change is

446
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,540
coming change is what life is all about

447
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,300
drag right but

448
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
um this is something I think that is

449
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,500
going to be a good thing

450
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,980
um keep calm you can still focus on

451
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,540
three two one

452
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,060
um and and don't you know you shouldn't

453
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,040
just all of a sudden get freaked out and

454
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,799
say oh no the sky is falling and lose

455
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,119
focus even on the things that you're

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,740
currently doing

457
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,839
getting prepared and being compliant to

458
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,540
321 is going to get you 90 of the way to

459
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,079
4.0 right so so it's not like the sky is

460
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,880
falling the world is changing that much

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,520
you got plenty of transition time

462
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
just don't squander it

463
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,900
so as you can see our our helper here

464
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
he's helping you understand it's time to

465
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,700
focus it's time to study and you know

466
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,080
something you could do now between now

467
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
and the end of the year is really sit

468
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
down and read and study there's a really

469
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
great changes document that the council

470
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,340
has put out that actually goes through

471
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,020
each individual requirement and shows

472
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,059
here's what it was here's what it is now

473
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,220
and here's the type of change it is it's

474
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,679
just a wording change or it's a new

475
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,700
requirement

476
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,860
etc etc so be familiar with that changes

477
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,360
document that's for those of you who are

478
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,820
familiar with PCI DSS already if you're

479
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,140
not maybe you start by reading the

480
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,880
standard at first

481
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,160
but I think that changes document is a

482
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,419
great place to start make sure you're

483
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,679
very familiar with that that can be

484
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,480
downloaded from the PCI council's

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
website

486
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,480
the next thing you would do would be

487
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,799
then to start with the whole standard

488
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,299
and kind of just get familiar with how

489
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,160
the new standard is laid out there's

490
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,500
some great new wording in the guidance

491
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,960
column

492
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,760
so that's an awesome thing to to be

493
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
familiar with there's a lot more

494
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,880
knowledge there and to help you

495
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,740
understand the intent of these

496
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,299
requirements

497
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,539
read blogs articles papers that kind of

498
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,160
stuff you know obviously there's tons of

499
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,600
those things published out there by many

500
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
different companies security metrics has

501
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,860
a lot of those available as well

502
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,020
um one thing I think that's really

503
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,240
important is in standard itself because

504
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
they're coming up with this new

505
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
validation method we'll talk about in a

506
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,179
minute called the customized approach

507
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,100
on many of the of the requirements

508
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,539
they'll have a section at the bottom

509
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,460
that says the customized approach

510
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,980
objective so if you really want to know

511
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,679
what they're trying to do with a

512
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,320
requirement you look for this customized

513
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,780
approach object you go oh I see they're

514
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,520
really trying to improve this thing or

515
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,020
they're trying to to make sure that we

516
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,020
have this thing handled this this

517
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,000
requirement

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,580
um this control this security item

519
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,620
so that's a great resource for you to

520
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,299
just be familiar with the new format of

521
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,120
the the standard paperwork itself

522
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,400
the introductory sections in the in this

523
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,419
and the whole standard have been

524
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,799
revamped there's a lot more information

525
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,320
there there's a lot more

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,140
um there's a glossary included at the

527
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,360
end there's there's more detailed

528
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,539
explanations of various things so spend

529
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,039
some time actually just reading the

530
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,480
standard

531
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,980
um make sure you have lots of Hot

532
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,559
Pockets coffee whatever keeps you awake

533
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,600
because it is not going to be exciting

534
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,460
I'm sorry

535
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,260
um unless you you know really like this

536
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,900
kind of stuff but it is important it may

537
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,700
not be exciting but it is important and

538
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
many of you are involved in your

539
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,320
company's compliance program or or given

540
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
responsibilities over systems that have

541
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,200
to meet that compliance so it's not

542
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,940
again something that's going away it's

543
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,980
not something that's really hard to do

544
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,840
you just have to get down and do it and

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
really understand it it's better to

546
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,200
learn it rather than be surprised by it

547
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,140
so um minus kind of the future dated

548
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,400
stuff

549
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,440
4.0 is really not a whole lot different

550
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,660
than three two one so if you want to

551
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,940
move to 4.0 even as early as next year

552
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,039
that's doable

553
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,320
just you're just not going to you know

554
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,000
really worry about the future dated

555
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,520
stuff maybe right so that could be a

556
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,000
potential strategy

557
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,400
after you've gotten kind of your

558
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,020
studying done what are some of your next

559
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,480
actions you know if it were me I'd

560
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,760
probably sit down and say let's look at

561
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,559
these future data requirements and let's

562
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,020
find out which ones will apply to me to

563
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,780
our systems to our company and then

564
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,760
start making a plan what is your one

565
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,039
year plan what's your two-year plan you

566
00:20:59,039 --> 00:20:59,940
know what are you going to be doing

567
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,620
because you really do only have two

568
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,500
years now because we're at the end of

569
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,039
2022 you've got 2023

570
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,320
2024 and just a teeny bit of 2025 to get

571
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,340
ready so

572
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,160
you know you got two and a half years at

573
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,940
the most here to to get ready for this

574
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,020
um you need to understand what

575
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,940
validation methods are there now the

576
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,039
direct approach is the same way that you

577
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,260
do it now it's here's the thing that's

578
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,059
written here's the testing procedure

579
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,520
here's how I do that here's how I meet

580
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
that testing procedure

581
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,140
that's the way that it's been done now a

582
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,640
lot of really large corporations or

583
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,679
maybe people have a very Advanced or a

584
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,620
mature security organization came to the

585
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
council and said look I just don't want

586
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,600
I just don't meet this exactly I just

587
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,640
can't meet these words

588
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,340
but I do have this and I think this

589
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,559
system does even more or meets the

590
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,799
intent of PCI this requirement can we do

591
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,780
that so that's why the council came up

592
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,400
with this thing called the customized

593
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,679
approach and it will they will allow you

594
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,440
to use that as a validation method it's

595
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,020
not for the faint of heart and we'll you

596
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,700
need to plan early for that so just kind

597
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,860
of learn think about what things you've

598
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,960
got can you meet the the exact

599
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,820
statements in the standard or do you

600
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,740
need to approach a different way

601
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,299
you may want to get some help you can

602
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:22,260
work for the qsa to get a 4-0 gap

603
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,720
you may want to look at

604
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,000
technology or other Solutions test them

605
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,640
out get used to them

606
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
some of those we'll be talking about in

607
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,919
just a minute that you may want to be

608
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,500
familiar with and again remember 321 is

609
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,780
still good till 2024 so make sure you're

610
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,720
staying focused on your current stuff

611
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,100
something that will apply to almost

612
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,840
every requirement in the new PCI

613
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,520
standard is is kind of a New Concept

614
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,039
around risk assessments

615
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,380
in the past in three to one well

616
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,940
currently even two in three two one

617
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,000
there is there's kind of one area in

618
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,760
section 12 that says conduct a an annual

619
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,200
risk assessment

620
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,240
and it's one or two lines in the

621
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,679
standard people are usually confused

622
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,679
about that is it really is it formal and

623
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,360
it's based on all these standards what

624
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,980
standard should I use blah blah blah

625
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,140
it's always been a little confusing for

626
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,760
our clients to deal with this risk

627
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,460
assessment stuff and so

628
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,159
um the council has decided to kind of

629
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,960
change that focus a little bit and not

630
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,000
have a corporate overall risk assessment

631
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,460
but now make targeted risk assessments

632
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,260
for very specific requirements there's

633
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,059
about nine requirements in the PCI

634
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,760
standard that risk assessments are going

635
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
to have to be done formally for to help

636
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,860
you determine some of these for example

637
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
a period how long your encryption key

638
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,740
management your key life is how long

639
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,360
your passwords are going to be good for

640
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,640
blah blah there used to be these set

641
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,200
things in the standard that would say

642
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
here's when we want you to change it

643
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,919
here's when you've got to do it now

644
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,500
they're saying you tell us when based on

645
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,539
the risk assessment and show and prove

646
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,000
to your assessor that this is a decent

647
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
analysis so it has to be real it can't

648
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,140
just be it can't just can't be something

649
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,140
you say well that's what our CEO wants

650
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,640
that's what I want that's what the head

651
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,740
of it wants that's what we're doing

652
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,780
back it up so that's going to be a new

653
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,919
thing that's going to add some work

654
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,860
to the audit for the next time so that's

655
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,240
something to be prepared for make sure

656
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,559
you're understanding what that really

657
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,900
entails how risk assessments are done

658
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,659
formalize that process especially if

659
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,039
you're going to be using a customized

660
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,659
approach you're going to have to have a

661
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,419
very detailed risk assessment done on

662
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,400
your new control that you've developed

663
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,380
to meet the intent of one of the

664
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,120
requirements in PCI

665
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,400
that's going to be a big and a heavy

666
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,159
lift there

667
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,380
okay so let's look at some of the top

668
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,600
10ish changes that I think and you'll

669
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,220
recognize many of these things are

670
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,840
familiar again they're not brand new

671
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,539
they're just some changes uh in some of

672
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,400
the standards so

673
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
um section one and section two there

674
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,520
really wasn't anything that was worth

675
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,460
mentioning section three uh which is

676
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,140
kind of all has always been about

677
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,120
encryption it's still about encryption

678
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
and encrypting data and making data

679
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,220
unusable to people who snag it

680
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,059
um

681
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,580
in in three two one there was a mention

682
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,620
of hey make sure that when you're using

683
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,620
remote access don't copy any data and it

684
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,140
was a process that you wanted to do now

685
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,080
they want it to be an actual

686
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,919
um

687
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,840
mechanism there needs to be something

688
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,539
that prevents the copy and paste of

689
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,580
credit card data that's what pan stands

690
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,440
for payment account number to a remote

691
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
system that's a future data 2025 thing

692
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,340
that's going to have to be a solution

693
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,620
probably that is part of your remote

694
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,979
access software

695
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,340
um again in 2025 if you're using hashing

696
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,340
right now to protect card data maybe

697
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,020
you're using it for lookups or or

698
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,520
whatever

699
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,880
then you have to use a keyed hash in the

700
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,840
future

701
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,659
a keyed hash is different than Leica to

702
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,960
or whatever it's it's like a hash but

703
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,580
with a key that you have to manage like

704
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,159
an encryption key so look it up read

705
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,779
about it you've got to implement some

706
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,279
changes there it's got to be a keyed

707
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,039
hash that'll be a change in software

708
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,080
um if you use hashing

709
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,200
section four is all about moving data

710
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,960
over public networks not much has

711
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
changed there other than they want you

712
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,480
to have a

713
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,340
an inventory a documented inventory of

714
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,580
all your SSL certs and transmission for

715
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,779
transmission anything you're using to

716
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,120
transmit data and you know where they're

717
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,679
certified where you're getting them when

718
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,360
they expire all that kind of information

719
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,159
so it's not a big deal you should have

720
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,480
been doing that anyway so now they're

721
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
just formalizing that and saying Hey by

722
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,559
2025 this has to be a very detailed list

723
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,559
so that you know all about your search

724
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,900
that you're you're using for moving data

725
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,720
around over the internet

726
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,600
section five is the the malware and

727
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,340
Antivirus kind of stuff

728
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,840
not much has changed there you still

729
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,539
have to have those systems

730
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,600
um they have added this process and

731
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,640
mechanism must be in place to detect and

732
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,559
protect against a phishing attack that's

733
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,380
a 2025 thing perhaps it's already part

734
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,360
of your email system a lot of people's

735
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,980
email systems already do that kind of

736
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,720
stuff the other thing that has to be

737
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,299
added to that is training employee

738
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:19,380
training

739
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,980
um

740
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,200
for this kind of stuff you've we've

741
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,340
heard a lot at the conference today

742
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,740
about training and and making sure that

743
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,539
it's effective this is again just

744
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,279
backing that up the council is saying

745
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,539
yes we agree

746
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,340
training about fishing is important

747
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,440
let's get that going

748
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,460
section 6 is you know updates and

749
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,020
software development and those kind of

750
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,179
things that's that section really only

751
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,059
the big one that's been added there is

752
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,980
on on many people's payment Pages

753
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,600
throughout throughout your web

754
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,659
applications people are are more and

755
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,720
more using include statements or scripts

756
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
from third-party sites or from other

757
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,440
places you're you're including them

758
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,880
you're right you're you're downloading

759
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,039
your your at one point some of our

760
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,700
friends guys I think they found 150

761
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,500
external scripts running on a on a card

762
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,120
payment page where you're typing in your

763
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,700
credit card numbers and that's a lot

764
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
right some of them are just saying

765
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,940
where's this guy's Mouse going and some

766
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,220
of them are how many times people you

767
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,720
know have searched for it on Google or

768
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,179
you know all these different things so

769
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,059
no longer can you just say

770
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,580
um well whoever gave that to me they're

771
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,400
secure they're responsible for it right

772
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,840
now the council is saying no we're

773
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,720
having too many uh compromises in those

774
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,020
situations you need to know all the

775
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,220
scripts that are running on a payment

776
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,820
page so you have to have a um

777
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,020
a place then where you're going to

778
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,179
review inventory authorize all those

779
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,000
scripts on payment Pages that's a 2025

780
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,760
thing that's going to be a big deal I

781
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,539
think

782
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,020
um and uh it may make people minimize

783
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,640
the number of scripts on a payment page

784
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
for example

785
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,360
Section 8 no real big things here other

786
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,460
than you know they're saying in the past

787
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,860
the password length has been seven

788
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,679
now they say let's make it 12. we all

789
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,240
know that even 12 probably isn't even

790
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,820
enough and passwords really are kind of

791
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,520
a a thing of the past

792
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,179
um

793
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,980
you know we're moving towards other

794
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,140
types of authentication and and together

795
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,000
with multi-factor those kinds of things

796
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,460
layer on that but moving from 7 to 12 in

797
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,360
PCI 4-0 that may not be a big deal it

798
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,039
may be a big deal depending on software

799
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,679
that you may write or buy or whatever to

800
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,880
make sure that it passes that

801
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,700
requirement that's a 2025 thing again so

802
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,080
it gives you plenty of time to work with

803
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,340
vendors or your own software teams

804
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,659
um again we've heard a lot about

805
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,460
multi-factor authentication today and

806
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,919
it's not it's not a Panacea it's not the

807
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,240
thing that solves all your problems it's

808
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,679
just another one of the layers and

809
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,000
security that you have in your systems

810
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,220
they're adding some requirements about

811
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,340
multi-factor authentication in

812
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,460
um 4.0 it's being

813
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,260
required for all access into the card

814
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,880
data environment that's even from inside

815
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,500
your network so it used to be from

816
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,760
outside your network you had to have

817
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,039
multi-factor authentication now they're

818
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,720
going to add that from insight as well

819
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,820
as well as adding some other kind of

820
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,500
features that you need to have in your

821
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,600
solution one of the things that we

822
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,580
notice a lot is that people will

823
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,679
you'll type in your username and your

824
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,659
password and then they'll give you your

825
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,299
third factor or your second Factor right

826
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,279
I think they're going to be looking for

827
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,440
solutions that present all all of those

828
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
at the same time and then when they say

829
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,159
you failed

830
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,020
you don't know which one failed you

831
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,580
don't know whether the password or the

832
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,520
mo or the or the one-time key or

833
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,740
whatever failed so some changes there

834
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,779
and kind of the way things work they're

835
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,760
also making sure that these things are

836
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,700
not you know they can't bypass them

837
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,679
etc etc so a little more requirements

838
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,500
there another thing in Section 8 is you

839
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,340
can't put system or software passwords

840
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,320
in files or Scripts

841
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,899
sometimes when you start up a piece of

842
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,460
software it will read

843
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,860
a password for a database out of a file

844
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,020
or put it in a script as you're running

845
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,059
so that's something that they're

846
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,799
noticing has been a problem in

847
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,899
compromises in the past so you've got to

848
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,399
think of another way to do that whether

849
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,279
it comes from an HSM or somebody types

850
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,020
it in on Startup whatever it may be

851
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,820
there'll be some other Solutions it'll

852
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,880
come that's a 2025 thing

853
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,260
that's coming as well

854
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,200
section 10 this one is a silly one but

855
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,220
they made a change and they actually

856
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,140
made it future dated no longer can you

857
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,740
read all of your system logs by hand

858
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,779
I don't know anybody who does that I

859
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,659
mean I had did one audit probably 18

860
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,279
years ago where somebody said that they

861
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,840
reviewed all of their Microsoft security

862
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,679
logs by hand and I'm going right and

863
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:53,880
they showed me a list of all the things

864
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,860
they do and so they're actually doing it

865
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,659
I don't think that's really possible

866
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,940
nowadays most people use a SIM tool to

867
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,620
actually do that but that's a

868
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,080
requirement they're making you can't do

869
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,940
manual log analysis anymore has to be

870
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,100
automated so that's a 2025 thing

871
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,539
something that's changing right away in

872
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,179
4-0 is if you have a failure of any of a

873
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,980
critical security controls is detected

874
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,600
you has to be alerted and responded to

875
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,100
so in other words if you're

876
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,220
firewall goes offline or if a router or

877
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,840
something you know some part of your

878
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,080
layered security is is gone or is

879
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,539
malfunctioning you have to know when

880
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:31,799
that's happening

881
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,539
that's something that service providers

882
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,659
have had to do in three two one but now

883
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,740
is being added for everybody

884
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,200
section 11

885
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,520
um

886
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,159
now internal vulnerability scans have to

887
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,220
be authenticated so that's a 2025 thing

888
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,039
and that means you know it's it you get

889
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,659
a lot more effective results if you're

890
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,000
having instead of looking at a software

891
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,799
application or some sort of service from

892
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,779
the outside you have to provide a

893
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,220
password as if you were inside the

894
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,860
network and then look at those I think

895
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,899
it you know it's preventing people from

896
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,640
once they get in somewhere moving around

897
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,679
easily inside the network we see that

898
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,659
happening a lot in our forensics team

899
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,179
and our forensics analysis so the

900
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,240
council is making that a requirement

901
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,760
many VA tools already do this you just

902
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,019
have to make sure that you know how

903
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:22,980
they're storing any of these

904
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,840
authentication these passwords things

905
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,340
like that make sure that they're doing

906
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,740
that in a PCI Compliant manner

907
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,820
self-assessment questionnaires are

908
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,620
something that smaller Merchants do not

909
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,200
typically what people you know that we

910
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
work with but there is a big change to a

911
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,539
self-assessment questionnaire a which is

912
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,279
an e-commerce thing for people who are

913
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,840
using

914
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,539
um iframes or maybe a button or a hosted

915
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,539
payment page for doing their e-commerce

916
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:52,740
before you didn't really have to do

917
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,360
scans or any kind of stuff for that page

918
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,659
in in 4.0 for 2025 you know starting

919
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,600
actually right away you have to have VA

920
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,679
scans if you've got an saqa type of a

921
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,719
page if you're if you're a merchant that

922
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,219
just has to validate with one of these

923
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,359
self-assessment questionnaires you've

924
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,460
got to have a scan that's not a big deal

925
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,500
it's maybe a couple hundred dollars a

926
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,300
year

927
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,399
the harder one is is the next one which

928
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,980
is a future dated one which is deploy a

929
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,839
change in tamper detection system for

930
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,119
payment page monitoring any of the

931
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,679
scripts that are on those payment Pages

932
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,500
now have to be mod monitored and you

933
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,418
need to know when they change from

934
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,280
something that you expect

935
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,139
that's not file Integrity monitoring

936
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,119
this is a dynamic thing this is

937
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,639
detecting it because mostly payment

938
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,739
pages are are being loaded dynamically

939
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,060
so it's not something you can just say

940
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,918
look at this file see if the file

941
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,440
changed because when that page is built

942
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,899
it often brings in 50 scripts from

943
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,359
somewhere else so this is a new process

944
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,180
it needs to run at least weekly that's a

945
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,339
new thing that's also being included in

946
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,380
PCI dss40 for anybody who does

947
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,599
e-commerce

948
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,200
um and for the saqs as well so

949
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
if you have if you do a report on

950
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,380
compliance you have to do both of these

951
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,460
things scanning of you know a

952
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,440
iframe page and also having this script

953
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
detection methodology the number of

954
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,040
companies out there with solutions for

955
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,660
that security metrics has a solution for

956
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,760
it but a lot of other companies have

957
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
those as well just be looking for those

958
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,079
Solutions probably testing those early

959
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,700
on before

960
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,520
of 2025.

961
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,200
would be helpful

962
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,040
the last section pcidia says 12 is

963
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,900
again not a whole lot of changes there

964
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,260
they've moved kind of this annual scope

965
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,060
reconfirmation kind of from from the

966
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,440
introduction when they just sort of

967
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,640
mentioned it and said you should do this

968
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,440
now it's a requirement in section 12.

969
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,720
you have to do a scope reconfirmation

970
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,420
every year and it has to be documented

971
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,640
and proven for service providers you

972
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,500
have to do it every six months so that's

973
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
a new thing

974
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,020
um

975
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,660
and if there's any kind of card data

976
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,180
detected or it's not supposed to be you

977
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,859
have to exercise your incident response

978
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,140
plan immediately that's a change not

979
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,420
like it's really a hard one or an odd

980
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,599
one but it it does sort of imply that

981
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,280
you might be doing some some regular

982
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,020
data Discovery to make sure that you

983
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,640
know where your cart data is and it's

984
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,240
not leaking out in an unencrypted manner

985
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,920
looking at flows making documenting your

986
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,300
flows and making sure that those flows

987
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,900
aren't changing

988
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,540
um

989
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,460
customized approach this is that new

990
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,400
validation method that I talked about it

991
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
has a lot of people buzzing about well

992
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
should I use it or is this the way it

993
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,220
has to be done now or you know is this

994
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
going to save me a lot of time I think

995
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,579
we heard early on well that's great

996
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,140
because I don't really want to meet that

997
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,300
requirement so I'm going to ask my qsa

998
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,280
to do a customized approach and then I

999
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,619
have to deal with it that's not the how

1000
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,540
it works

1001
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,940
um we'll talk about how that is now we

1002
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,000
realize that compensating controls are

1003
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,740
not a replacement for it's not

1004
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,180
customized approach it's not a

1005
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,500
replacement for customized for

1006
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,200
compensating controls composite controls

1007
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,960
are still possible and can be used in a

1008
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
report

1009
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,500
but that's typically for something

1010
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,240
that's restricting in other words you

1011
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,520
you you have some sort of physical or

1012
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,339
legal constraint that you need and

1013
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:24,720
that's where you use a compensating

1014
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,680
control and a customized approach is if

1015
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,500
you can't meet the letter of the defined

1016
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,720
here's what we want you to do in the

1017
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,940
standard but you have another way that

1018
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,500
you think is better you can say I'd like

1019
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,660
to use the customized approach on that

1020
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,180
the hard part is that it's really not

1021
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,040
the work of the qsa to Define everything

1022
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,560
that's the entity or the client's job

1023
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,980
you have the hardest lift the heavy lift

1024
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,900
in that you have to develop the control

1025
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,839
test the control document the control do

1026
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,820
a risk analysis prove that this control

1027
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,740
actually does meet the intent of the

1028
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,780
requirement present that information to

1029
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,540
the qsa the qsa reviews it then comes up

1030
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,460
with a testing procedure and then you

1031
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,780
move forward so it's something you've

1032
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,880
got to work together on it's not

1033
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,560
something that you just say to the qsa

1034
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,859
take care of this for me

1035
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:15,839
so frankly it's something that really is

1036
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
is really for entities that have mature

1037
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,619
risk and I.T teams this is not for the

1038
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,599
faint of heart it's a whole lot more

1039
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,980
work

1040
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,579
um

1041
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,880
and it's just

1042
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,920
it really was made some of the really

1043
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,980
large Merchant and large Banks bugged

1044
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,839
the PCI Council saying hey look we'd

1045
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,640
like to do something different

1046
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,700
they made it possible for that but it

1047
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,040
really isn't for the run-of-the-mill

1048
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,520
company unless you've got a really well

1049
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,099
defined risk process highly skilled I.T

1050
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,000
team

1051
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,560
all that kind of stuff it's not

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,240
impossible but it's going to be probably

1053
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,700
harder and more expensive to do so

1054
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,260
make sure you kind of have that

1055
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,880
understanding before you jump into that

1056
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,800
method learn all about those

1057
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
expectations before starting off on that

1058
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
path

1059
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,079
so here's some of the main changes

1060
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,880
that are effective immediately we

1061
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,520
mentioned that there was I think 11 no

1062
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,260
there were 13 of those we're not going

1063
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,119
to go over every one but here are the

1064
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,079
ones that I thought were the biggest

1065
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,220
ones

1066
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,060
VA scans for for SAQ or for for a

1067
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,859
payment page that maybe you didn't used

1068
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,660
to have to scan

1069
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,300
is is a big one this targeted risk

1070
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,339
analysis process is kind of a new thing

1071
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:33,900
that's effective immediately

1072
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,240
uh formal reconfirmation of that scope

1073
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,060
annually a documented process that's a

1074
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,339
new thing and then for every requirement

1075
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:45,359
all 12 areas they've added something a

1076
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,820
big documentation Chunk in each one of

1077
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,880
those so yay who likes to write I love

1078
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,480
writing I love reading writing right

1079
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,520
no nobody really likes to do the writing

1080
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,320
stuff so unfortunately they're saying

1081
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
you need to document now the roles and

1082
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,500
responsibilities

1083
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,800
for performing any activities covered by

1084
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,980
this section and you have to make sure

1085
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,359
they're documented assigned and

1086
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,180
understood and accepted right by people

1087
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,520
so it's just sort of a table it's a form

1088
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm sure your qsas will have kind of

1089
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,540
some help there for some template

1090
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,880
documentation but it's just another task

1091
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,400
another lift that you've got to do right

1092
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,460
away for 4-0 so again not massive right

1093
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,320
it's not like oh no I'll never be able

1094
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
to be 4-0 certified you can do it as

1095
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,900
early as next year or right away even if

1096
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,240
you want if you're a cyclist even before

1097
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,280
the end of the year you can start on it

1098
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,440
and just not really work on some of

1099
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,820
these future dated ones until you're

1100
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,359
ready for that

1101
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
there was one this has been a topic that

1102
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,160
came up and was it was quite a big idea

1103
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,480
I don't know maybe if anybody's familiar

1104
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,920
because everybody heard of in place with

1105
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,359
remediation as a finding is this

1106
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,220
something that anybody's heard about

1107
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,500
when the new templates came out for the

1108
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,119
self-assessment questionnaires and for

1109
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,880
the report on compliance there was a new

1110
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,760
column added there was in place not in

1111
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,339
place and in place with remediation

1112
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,560
and this was something that a lot of

1113
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,240
people you know the council thought this

1114
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,980
is going to be awesome this will be

1115
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,380
great because then the the companies can

1116
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,060
be basically put on notice and saying

1117
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,400
hey look you're okay now but I'm just

1118
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,720
letting you know that you didn't have

1119
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,880
this in place and so you had to fix

1120
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,099
something so make sure you're aware of

1121
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,720
that for next year's audit kind of a

1122
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,640
type of thing so it's a way of helping

1123
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,460
people understand hey if all of your

1124
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,619
requirements or if a large portion of

1125
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,300
them if your report is in place with

1126
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,760
remediation you may have some problems

1127
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,740
with your process

1128
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,300
so they thought it was a great thing and

1129
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,740
you know it's not necessarily a bad

1130
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,359
thing as far as an auditor perspective

1131
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,700
the hard part comes when you get lawyers

1132
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,619
involved and a lot of companies were

1133
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,900
saying wait a minute I have a contract

1134
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,640
with

1135
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,700
um a company to do their call center or

1136
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,680
whatever and and

1137
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,540
we're their call center and they say

1138
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,640
that we have to be PCI Compliant they

1139
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,520
came to me and said it looks like if

1140
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,079
you're in place with remediation you

1141
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,700
were out of compliance during the year

1142
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,859
at some point so therefore you owe us

1143
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,099
this money right or we are canceling our

1144
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,839
contract with you because you were out

1145
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,359
of compliance

1146
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,820
so and that really wasn't the intent

1147
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,320
that wasn't what the council wanted to

1148
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,300
do a lot of people

1149
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:24,900
um

1150
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,200
in Industry all the qsas uh were kind of

1151
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,960
up in arms about it so as part of the

1152
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,880
gear I provided a lot of feedback to the

1153
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,040
council and there was a lot of

1154
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,660
discussions and they decided just a

1155
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,619
couple weeks ago to remove that whole

1156
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,200
validation column from the saqs and from

1157
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,180
The Rock so there really won't be that

1158
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,500
anymore it's not something that will

1159
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,060
change it'll still just be in place not

1160
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,460
in place not applicable

1161
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,060
um

1162
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,339
so that's removed it'll be it'll be gone

1163
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,099
see how happy she is that's how happy I

1164
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,540
am too

1165
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,819
um it's going to be gone

1166
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,740
there will be a they're replacing it

1167
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,839
with kind of a work paper or a worksheet

1168
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,000
that can be used as part of the

1169
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,400
assessment work papers

1170
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,900
it's really the same thing that we've

1171
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,400
always done you know we say hey look

1172
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,900
here's the stuff that we did before

1173
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,300
here's the stuff that you guys when we

1174
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,640
are on site just wasn't quite right if

1175
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,260
you just fix this we'll be okay a lot of

1176
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,060
it is documentation things maybe for

1177
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,900
example

1178
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,500
so it doesn't really Merit so much

1179
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,380
weight as it felt and so there'll be a

1180
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,540
work paper that we can submit to to

1181
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,280
customers that say Hey this is some

1182
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,900
areas you need Improvement so that's how

1183
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,579
what the compromise was with the council

1184
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,140
so

1185
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,880
um it's really letting kind of the

1186
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,800
Auditors and and all the IT people kind

1187
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,599
of do their jobs rather than getting

1188
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,800
involved in legal Contracting issues

1189
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
so that's a good thing

1190
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
all right well to sum up just study get

1191
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,300
familiar with some of the bigger changes

1192
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,640
read the standard itself is a good idea

1193
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,160
read those changes documents consider

1194
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,020
engaging with the qsa to help a lot of

1195
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,960
people are doing a gap analysis for 4-0

1196
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,400
before you even have to worry about

1197
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,400
being compliant to 4-0 that's a an

1198
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,920
option for you

1199
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,680
um you can move to 4-0 now and just work

1200
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,420
on the future dated stuff

1201
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,339
you can make sure that you know about

1202
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,619
risk assessment expectations are being

1203
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,180
raised

1204
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:21,900
um

1205
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,760
unless you're a real mature organization

1206
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,380
don't even think about customized

1207
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,520
approach and there's plenty of time just

1208
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,079
don't get caught behind the eight ball

1209
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,300
and wait too long

1210
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,480
so with that

1211
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,060
um if there are any questions or and but

1212
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,160
no tomatoes I don't need any Tomatoes

1213
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,839
nobody throw that stuff but if you have

1214
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,180
a question I can try to answer it this

1215
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,940
is free qsa time

1216
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,339
right no charge yes sir

1217
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,339
yeah

1218
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,020
so the question is and you know the

1219
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,359
question is you know risk assessment

1220
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:13,079
um

1221
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,180
always is just a little vague right and

1222
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,800
the wording even now is just sort of

1223
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,480
like conduct a risk assessment and prove

1224
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,700
to your qsa that you're doing that that

1225
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,079
you're

1226
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,079
um that your encryption key should be

1227
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,599
active for six months or two years or

1228
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,579
whatever the number is right we're using

1229
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:33,540
you know 12 character passwords so or 14

1230
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,220
character password so ours should go for

1231
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,599
two years rather than one year or six

1232
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,460
months or something more than 90 days

1233
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,020
whatever it is so you have you have

1234
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,000
something that you're going after it'll

1235
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,619
be obvious in the standard which things

1236
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,660
that you've got to make these decisions

1237
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,619
on

1238
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,740
and there are some some you know

1239
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,359
well-documented risk assessment

1240
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,980
methodologies

1241
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,760
um

1242
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,540
you know nist 800-30 it's it's a big

1243
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,119
animal and really for handling you know

1244
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,760
whole networks and everything you might

1245
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,440
be able to look at those and kind of say

1246
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,780
well I don't really need an inventory of

1247
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,760
all my systems I may just need a

1248
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,260
fraction of that so you're going to have

1249
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,480
to modify some of those because they're

1250
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,540
not going for this massive

1251
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,819
um process but it just needs to be hey

1252
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,339
what have you thought about prove to me

1253
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:21,839
that you know show me what you thought

1254
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,540
about and let's work together even with

1255
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,460
your Cosa and say look

1256
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,619
here's why we think we don't have to

1257
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,160
change our passwords every 90 days this

1258
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,480
is what we're doing

1259
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,040
and

1260
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,380
and here are the risks that really you

1261
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,060
know the risks for that you have to

1262
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,280
think well if I don't change my password

1263
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,460
then then it might be available in one

1264
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,920
of these password dumps right what is

1265
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,020
the chances that somebody has used this

1266
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,119
password somewhere else

1267
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,920
if you have some sort of control over

1268
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,020
your employees and you can say look we

1269
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,760
auto-generate this password you need to

1270
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,079
use it and save it in a different way

1271
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,940
it's none of the passwords you've ever

1272
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,700
used that may be a diff that may be you

1273
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,380
know a way of handling that risk that

1274
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,599
would be different so it just needs to

1275
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,240
be defensible and I don't think as far

1276
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,800
as if you know if I'm a qsa I'm not

1277
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,200
going to say okay I'm sorry you didn't

1278
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,099
do the um uh gangly wrench version of

1279
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,680
the risk assessment published by the

1280
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,060
nist and you know let's just I just want

1281
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,740
to see that you've thought about all the

1282
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,599
things that could could possibly

1283
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,339
compromise that password for example

1284
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,740
that that period of time

1285
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,079
um and and

1286
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,660
show me that that is a reasonable time

1287
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,800
period

1288
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,119
so

1289
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,680
I don't know if anybody else has any

1290
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,420
there's a bunch of the guys that I work

1291
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,800
with here if they have any kind of

1292
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,380
thoughts on that but

1293
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,339
yeah Chris

1294
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,000
right

1295
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,859
so unfortunately it's always going to be

1296
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,540
vague right because they want you to

1297
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,640
think

1298
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,099
the what

1299
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,940
you might argument

1300
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,419
appliances Europe

1301
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,260
since you're a good USA makes the

1302
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,940
decision of whether or not bill

1303
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,960
picture

1304
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,940
on your report and at the end of the day

1305
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,220
your compliance is still your response

1306
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,859
right but we then become a team when one

1307
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:40,740
of qsa signs the report

1308
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,780
hey we're part of your we're part of

1309
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,000
your compliance team a little bit right

1310
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,040
so it's not like we're just saying yeah

1311
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,420
we're signing it but we're not taking

1312
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,420
any any responsibility no qsas take some

1313
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,859
responsibility but it really should be

1314
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,720
you should view it as it's not a an

1315
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,640
adversarial or a competition type of

1316
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,800
environment think about your qsa as

1317
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,000
somebody that's there to help you out

1318
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,220
and and work with them right and then

1319
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,000
you become a team

1320
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,500
any other questions

1321
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,900
that was a good one oh here wait I was

1322
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,420
going to say when somebody when somebody

1323
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,480
um

1324
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,619
sent gives me a question you get a

1325
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,000
t-shirt another question

1326
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,880
um there are not any new SAQ types other

1327
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,920
than they have announced

1328
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,240
um so in other words all the ones you're

1329
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,460
familiar with are still there just

1330
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,140
recently they announced one that's

1331
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,240
called the Spock

1332
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,359
qsa right and it does have doesn't have

1333
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:38,099
anything to do with logic

1334
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:42,000
um frankly it's it's for mobile systems

1335
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,640
with an attached so like if you're at a

1336
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,920
store and somebody says let me take your

1337
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,380
credit card I have a phone here they

1338
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,880
have to have a separate device that

1339
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,540
they're doing that on yeah so it really

1340
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,540
it's a requirement for there pretty soon

1341
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,020
um they'll have a new requirement for

1342
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,900
mpoc which is the the mobile pin on cots

1343
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,980
on Commercial off-the-shelf devices

1344
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,520
they'll have a new one of those soon so

1345
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,500
that's coming out right

1346
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,000
so let's see did you get a t-shirt

1347
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,859
before

1348
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,700
no you want socks or t-shirt

1349
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,819
all right

1350
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,160
any other questions

1351
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,000
yes sir

1352
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,180
one more time one more time so as long

1353
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,200
as repeat the question

1354
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,260
oh okay

1355
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,500
that's a good question the question was

1356
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,480
when we when they talk about passwords

1357
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,520
inside files not being available anymore

1358
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,200
is that just for Clear text or could you

1359
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,300
encrypt it

1360
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,740
I don't really know the answer to that

1361
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,420
question I'm guessing it probably works

1362
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,400
for encrypted as well but because that's

1363
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,380
usually how people are doing it but I

1364
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,720
don't know so

1365
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,700
ask me in two months

1366
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,180
oh

1367
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,000
there we go socks

1368
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,260
and let's see I don't know if I have

1369
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,760
anything else in my goodie bag oh I just

1370
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,980
have a thing of water

1371
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,540
if somebody else asked a question you

1372
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,220
can go to our booth and get some socks

1373
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,359
right

1374
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,160
or whatever you want

1375
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,660
I didn't think there'd be we'd have this

1376
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,619
many

1377
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,599

1378
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,280
time here and it's

1379
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,440

1380
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,119
