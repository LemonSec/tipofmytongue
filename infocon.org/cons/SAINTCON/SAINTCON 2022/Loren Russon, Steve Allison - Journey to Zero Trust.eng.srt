1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,639
um what I'd love to do is invite you to

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,200
come forward if you'd like to we think

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,180
that you know the 430 slot means that

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,099
it's going to be a bit sparse

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,420
if you want to sit and back that's still

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,660
final uh is still okay

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,160
um what I'd like to do is just invite

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,260
everyone to participate we're going to

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,180
have a little bit of time for Q a at the

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,400
end but what we'd like to do is leave

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
you with at least an understanding of

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,260
how to approach zero trust so before I

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,699
start I'd love to get a raise of hands

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,980
how many have zero trust initiatives in

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,539
their company today

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,640
anyone

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,239
how many are familiar with the concept

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,680
how many are not familiar with the

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
concept maybe is a better way to say it

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
okay we have a good mix I think we have

21
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,300
some that are in projects some are

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,180
familiar with it and some not well as we

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,680
go through this I hope to leave you with

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,960
at least an understanding of what the

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,120
elements are to zero trust you'll hear a

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
lot of companies say that it's just

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,120
about the network but it's more than

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,039
that and hopefully we'll leave you with

29
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,440
an understanding of how identity Centric

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,660
approach to zero trust gives you a lot

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,520
of flexibility as well as gets you to

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,799
really some of the goals and the

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,140
approaches that are necessary would also

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,640
like to make sure that you have an

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,740
approach meaning where do I start we

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,540
have a lot of our organizations and

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,040
companies we work with that just say I

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,299
don't even know where to start and we'll

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,740
hopefully give you a framework to do

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,520
that

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,979
and then we'll talk about how to take

42
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,439
that Journey so once I have the

43
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,479
framework once I've done an assessment

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,860
and then we'll give you a pathway to get

45
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,020
there sound good

46
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,460
for head nods all right

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,140
so first thing I'd like to you know get

48
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,240
into is really what are some of the

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,340
goals and if I go quickly through this

50
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,840
you know the goal is really just about

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,140
how can I provide as granular of control

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,880
to the access to the resources I

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,340
possibly can it's really about the more

54
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,720
information I have and know about

55
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
someone the better I can protect than

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
the resources they have at a very

57
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,780
granular level if you look about the

58
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,119
approach you know there's a lot of

59
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
discussion going on in the security

60
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,520
Arena where if you provide security in a

61
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,680
centralized fashion you start to gain

62
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,299
that centralized control but what it

63
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,860
does is take some of that control away

64
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,380
from the app owner what's been happening

65
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,239
as we look at standard as we look at

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,739
different new technologies you'll

67
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,180
hopefully see through the through this

68
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,800
approach that you can actually take a

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,340
centralized approach to a policy it's

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,959
almost a policy is code kind of an

71
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,879
approach and then you move enforcement

72
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,220
close to the app and so once you look at

73
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,599
this you're really your goal is to get

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
as granular as you possibly can and then

75
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,500
the approach is centralized with

76
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,840
enforcement distributed

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
now if you take the next step you know

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
it's really about starting with some of

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,480
the principles so first off there's

80
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,700
three principles to zero trust the first

81
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,459
is is that it doesn't matter what

82
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,319
network you're on doesn't matter if it's

83
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
inside or outside the firewall the

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,180
network no longer can protect from

85
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,819
Insider threat you really have threat

86
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,099
from external identities as well as

87
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,540
internal identities

88
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,519
you also have the case where public

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,280
networks really and private networks are

90
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,720
almost the same we talked to a lot of

91
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,580
our customers that do a lot of their

92
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,340
business operations out on the net they

93
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,620
consume SAS Services as well as they

94
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,420
keep things internal and they're roughly

95
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,640
treating them the same and then last is

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,920
just to admit to us that we need a

97
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,180
change and that we need to have

98
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,760
continual assessment to be able to

99
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,379
ensure that you understand the security

100
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,420
framework the cons the security

101
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,300
Foundation of your platform so what that

102
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,280
really does I mean what it means then is

103
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
I have to first manage all of the

104
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,720
devices and users that come in I have to

105
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,180
verify those device and users I also

106
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,340
have to authenticate and authorize

107
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,560
access to those devices and users to the

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
resources that I'm protecting and in a

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,819
more modern fashion it's not only just

110
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,860
about authenticating and authorizing but

111
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,720
I have to continually assess continual

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,060
monitor on the access for them and

113
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,560
that's really done through an

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
orchestration layer that you'll see in

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,519
some of the Frameworks we'll get to yeah

116
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,760
something I want to add is um for those

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,379
who haven't really heard of zero trust

118
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,260
aren't looking or haven't had any

119
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,519
background on that how many people have

120
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,099
heard of ransomware

121
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,680
okay so the same principles that apply

122
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,019
to mitigating ransomware are the same

123
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,239
principles that will apply to zero trust

124
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,500
so if you're having a problem with

125
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,180
ransomware or you think you're going to

126
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,459
or you want to find out whether you're

127
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,019
going to be vulnerable towards a

128
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,240
ransomware type attack these same

129
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,759
principles apply to preventing those

130
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,460
attacks so I like to put you know when I

131
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,199
talk with a lot of customers they want

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,340
they they can see that better than well

133
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,500
why zero trust you know why do I need to

134
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,660
control the identity and to control the

135
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,280
devices to control the network I mean

136
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
that's really hard but why and these

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
principles will help them with

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,580
ransomware it makes it a lot easier to

139
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,139
explain to um

140
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,540
to be able to you know implement this

141
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,300
yeah thanks Steve yeah I think there's a

142
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,160
lot of metaphors of hopefully by the end

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
of this you'll find that the Frameworks

144
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
can apply to all kinds of attacks and

145
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,580
all kind of threat factors one thing

146
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,560
also we wanted to bring to bear is there

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
is this discussion in the industry how

148
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,400
many have raise a hand understand or

149
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
have heard of zero trust network access

150
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,880
sort of how many have I've heard of zero

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
trust identity access

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,860
a few of you and I think there's two

153
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,360
different lenses out in the market and

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,699
as you you know talk through your zero

155
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,440
trust strategy there really isn't one

156
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
approach I think you have to look at a

157
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
balanced model if you look at the

158
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
network-centric approach they really are

159
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,220
about establishing implicit trust to be

160
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,440
able to control either information going

161
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,539
out or information coming in when you

162
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,460
look at an identity Centric approach

163
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,960
it's really about defining lease

164
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,880
privileges and be able to ensure that

165
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,740
you have the granularity that's required

166
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,320
now you look at also then with those two

167
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,699
different philosophies it's really about

168
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,800
how do I best protect resources and it's

169
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,199
just not web apps anymore it's apis it's

170
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,900
data it's access to particular

171
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,139
information either via consent

172
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,520
authorization or the organization

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
granting trust or granting access to

174
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
them

175
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,120
so if we take that balance between the

176
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
network as well as the identity it

177
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
really is simplified down into four

178
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,520
different steps you first have to manage

179
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,259
the device so you've got to trust them

180
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,080
and manage them to enable a user to be

181
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,699
able to get onto them then you have to

182
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,639
authenticate so if you are you know

183
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
strongly authenticating a user and you

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,380
ensure that that device is managed and

185
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,120
secured and paired with that identity

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
you start to develop that initial trust

187
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,220
second you have to dynamically authorize

188
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,919
anyone know what that means

189
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,919
anyone want to take a guess

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,259
just shout it out

191
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,819
what

192
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,340
MFA so strongly authentic Kate is more

193
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,440
on the MFA and when I talk about Dynamic

194
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,300
authorization it's really about bringing

195
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,160
intelligence bringing information into

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
that authorization process so I know who

197
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,860
you are and I've granted you access but

198
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,259
now I want to be able to ensure based on

199
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,240
the latest contextual information what

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,699
you can and can't do and then last is

201
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,440
just to ensure that your enforcement

202
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
sits at the edge so that's really taking

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
all those principles and breaking down

204
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,380
into manage the devices pair them to an

205
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,479
authenticated user authenticate who they

206
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,699
are make sure you have the latest

207
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,039
contextual risk information about the

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,720
user before you grant access to that

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,300
resource that's protected by the network

210
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,979
now if you look at one of the

211
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,740
fundamental principles is that you've

212
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,020
got to look at your full ecosystem I

213
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,460
remember having a conversation with one

214
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,080
of our partners Microsoft and they said

215
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,419
yeah we can do it all and the more we

216
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,919
peeled the onion we started to say well

217
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,000
not really you may have some Network or

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
infrastructure Security Service you may

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,599
have some identity Services you may even

220
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,060
have a way to manage devices but the

221
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,680
thing you're missing is really a full

222
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,199
layer strategy around that and so at

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
ping we talk quite often about identity

224
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
is really at the center and then there's

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,860
relationships established with the

226
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,780
various layers within the environment

227
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,639
now when we were looking at a zero trust

228
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,099
strategy we did a few things we said all

229
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,780
right then let's take identity at the

230
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,099
center and then what kind of

231
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,500
relationships do we need to have some of

232
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,419
it leverages identity Technologies

233
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,240
others work with other providers this is

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
just a map it's a bit of an eye chart

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
for those in the back but that mapping

236
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,039
gives you a sense of those things that

237
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,080
are identity Centric things that get to

238
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,300
know who you are we verify who you are

239
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,879
we give you MFA capabilities to strongly

240
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,280
authenticate you who you are and then we

241
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,020
give you the ability to protect those

242
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,360
resources but what do you do when it

243
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,458
comes down to I want to

244
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,020
make sure that this phone's been

245
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
jailbroken or not I need some kind of

246
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,820
managed service or I want to apply DLP

247
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,099
to that device I want to be able to

248
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,320
secure the network at the edge I want to

249
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,760
be able to secure at the edge before

250
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,260
they access

251
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,720
um you know a SAS app those all require

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,240
an ecosystem to work together by this

253
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,620
framework

254
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,420
now if you go to that next step then as

255
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,220
you look at those things that you know

256
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,560
ping provided we're all very identity

257
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,940
Centric and we'll talk a little bit

258
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,800
later about the journey that you would

259
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,959
take with ping as well as in how do we

260
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,880
connect to some of these Partners but

261
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,160
this just gives you a map of our view of

262
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,140
the ecosystem now how many of you have

263
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,839
vendors that are up on the board

264
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,700
in your network there's some of those

265
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,440
you know vendors downstairs and you can

266
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,940
talk to them and so take Beyond trust

267
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
for example they're very strong in

268
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,500
privileged access management a key

269
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,360
component to be able to secure access to

270
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,160
your infrastructure something that is

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
you know working well together with ping

272
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,660
you can start to provide you know very

273
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,820
strong authentication you can ensure

274
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,920
that that privileged account has the

275
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,600
right level of protection to protect the

276
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,820
resources that they're getting into

277
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,500
so once you look down at that domain

278
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,000
those are all the players all the

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
different categories essentially within

280
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,140
a zero trust framework then you need to

281
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,240
break down the domains and those domains

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
are again on that identity realm device

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,200
realm that we talked about before but

284
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
you can see now that its identities

285
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,220
pairing with the device before they can

286
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,560
access the application the data or the

287
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
service and then what does the network

288
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,459
do in helping protect accessing to

289
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,200
either to those resources that are

290
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,260
inside the firewall versus outside

291
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,360
and so we translated that all into a

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,880
reference architecture so consider an

293
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,920
identity Centrics reference architecture

294
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
really does start then with two things

295
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,940
kind of as core the first is an

296
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,279
authentication Authority and that sits

297
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,860
in the middle and does a few things

298
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,959
anyone again back to the MFA question

299
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,720
does an authentication Authority manage

300
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
what kind of authentication types what

301
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,600
kind of authentication methods are used

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,480
yes thank you had not so an

303
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
authentication Authority is really there

304
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,740
to help adjudicate decisions and so I

305
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,360
remember I was at a large Airline one

306
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,860
time and they said you know we have 40

307
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,720
different roles and some of them are on

308
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,760
the tarmac summer agents at the desk

309
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,579
some are pilots that are disconnected in

310
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,500
the airplane they all need to

311
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,420
authenticate strongly but we need a

312
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,339
bunch of different methods some of them

313
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,680
are doing it offline some of her doing

314
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
it on a kiosk some of them need to you

315
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
know use a glove and so it's a different

316
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,180
kind of method that they're

317
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,100
authenticating and that authentication

318
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,320
Authority sits in the middle of that and

319
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,700
helps manage which type of

320
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,220
authentication is required Dynamic

321
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,959
authorization is the same you know

322
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,480
because that authorization is really the

323
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,120
policy Administration and decision point

324
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,579
for determining you know who and what

325
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,620
and under what context they can access a

326
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,720
specific resource and then orchestration

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
really sits underneath to help manage

328
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
that user experience we'll talk a little

329
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,360
bit later there anything that Steve or

330
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,519
yeah I think a good example for this

331
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,680
will be hospitals because hospitals

332
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
don't want to spend a dime unless it's

333
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,620
going to make you know Health Care to

334
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,500
patients easier and so being able to use

335
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,540
a kind of an automatic authentication

336
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,040
they can log in and do their

337
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,019
multi-factor one time but they want to

338
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,720
be able to go from from kiosk to kiosk

339
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
you know in different rooms and just do

340
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
like a one touch on their badge so maybe

341
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,339
every two hours they're going to

342
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,519
re-authenticate but you want to make on

343
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,019
the end user you still want to make it

344
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,420
as easy as possible for them because you

345
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,160
know when security starts getting too

346
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
difficult for the users then they just

347
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,399
don't want to do it they're going to

348
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,779
find a way to get around it every time

349
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,779
yeah thank you so consider then the

350
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,519
reference architecture are all the piece

351
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,200
Parts it's not quite a deployment

352
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,820
architecture but at least talks about

353
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,040
the pieces that are there the next thing

354
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,899
I wanted to bring up is considering the

355
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,579
user something that happened I think

356
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,140
during the lockdown was it really

357
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,200
shifted the value of the end user so

358
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
consider an employee used to be treated

359
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,100
like okay it's good enough security well

360
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
that's changed once they went remote

361
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
they started to act a whole lot more

362
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
like a partner or a customer

363
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
and so you look at zero trust then is

364
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,640
really about you know how can I leverage

365
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,500
the best security and technology and

366
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,120
create the best user experience and

367
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,980
what's been interesting is by bringing

368
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,200
both together having the right pieces

369
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,060
and then the right experience you

370
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,519
actually can improve that security a few

371
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,260
examples of that is that verification

372
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,260
now it's very easy to leverage online

373
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,300
verification technology using life

374
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,459
selfie match against your driver's

375
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,440
license or passport and be able to

376
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,380
onboard someone in a self-service flow

377
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,940
consider them profile management allows

378
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,040
you to do Progressive profiling where

379
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,660
you may know a little bit about a user

380
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,399
but over time you get to know them

381
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,720
better you can start to Grant more

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
access all again better user experiences

383
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,980
go forward take authentication

384
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,839
authorization we talked about them of

385
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,519
just requiring a lot of different

386
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,980
factors an authorization to be able to

387
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,200
ensure what they can get to and then you

388
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
have some Legacy systems you'd also need

389
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,740
to manage what they're entitled to

390
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,540
that's either by managing groups

391
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,480
managing attributes about those users or

392
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,459
Distributing essentially sending group

393
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,200
information down to the application so

394
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,899
they can secure it the last two ones are

395
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,820
really where we then start to bring in a

396
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,000
little more of that Network layer and

397
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,700
level of access control is now how do I

398
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,579
protect and so can I get signals can I

399
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,160
get feeds from my client device or can I

400
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,720
get signals from the network that tell

401
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,459
me what that posture is telling me you

402
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,500
know what the risk level is there

403
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,480
then be able to detect if there is

404
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
anomalistic behavior or there are

405
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,959
threats and then be able to respond and

406
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,880
react to that and so it's really that

407
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,860
user experience walking them through

408
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,480
that zero trust security framework

409
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,820
that's worth considering

410
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,459
yeah please add to that the detective

411
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,839
respond is really important with that

412
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,240
again I like to roll things back into uh

413
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,220
a why why do we do things I was that

414
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,660
irritating kid that was always asking

415
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,399
why and so when we're looking at that

416
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,959
detect and respond and putting that into

417
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
the entire big picture it's it's like

418
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
again going back to ransomware if

419
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,660
somebody clicks on a link and then they

420
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,240
end up getting uh you know allowing

421
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,620
somebody onto their machine the first

422
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,180
thing they're going to do is try to you

423
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,860
know enumerate the network and find out

424
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,880
what other machines they can get on

425
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
using those credentials well if they

426
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,000
don't have MFA they're pretty much

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
stopped right there but you also want to

428
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,440
have that detect and respond to know

429
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,000
that hey something's happening here

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
where this user is trying to move from

431
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,899
this machine to this machine but not in

432
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,240
a normal way or not in a normal behavior

433
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,820
so that's kind of the why behind that

434
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,279
that last slide yeah it's great and this

435
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
is really just that next stage of take

436
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,500
that last slide bring in that flow a

437
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,240
user experience across that and then how

438
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,339
do some of those Technologies relate so

439
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,779
hopefully I'm giving you the way to

440
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,519
connect to from the the elements the

441
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,440
piece part Parts down to the actual user

442
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,000
experiences there

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
now the next thing we'd like to talk

444
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,779
about is so where do you start zero

445
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,579
trust is a big elephant you look at all

446
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,199
those different security categories

447
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,740
those areas that you have to consider

448
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,079
and one thing that had happened over the

449
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,820
last two to three years is that

450
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,440
companies have come out with Frameworks

451
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,380
so nist came out with I think that's the

452
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,260
you know special publication it's what

453
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,560
802 207 I believe and then you have the

454
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,180
cyber security and infrastructure

455
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,920
Security Agency came out with the

456
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
framework and that's really what you see

457
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,459
here now this framework's important

458
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,500
because it takes those building blocks

459
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,019
that are there and then allows you to do

460
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,820
an assessment that assessments just to

461
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,920
determine where you're at against all

462
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,060
those capabilities all those

463
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,620
Technologies we had

464
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,360
so we talked to some customers are like

465
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,100
we have we don't have single sign-on

466
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,500
nailed we have single password and

467
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,639
everyone logs in with the same password

468
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,620
and a lot of different machines we have

469
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,000
others that are like oh they've got

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,620
strong authentication and they're even

471
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,980
using risk scores to bring in you know a

472
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,660
large pharmaceutical customer of ours

473
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,519
you know they went through that journey

474
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,800
of single password to when they added

475
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,720
Federation to do single sign-on across

476
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,279
all of these they added multi-factor

477
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,500
authentication and they added risk and

478
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,420
it gave them a way to sort of mature

479
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,860
through that process as they brought

480
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,199
identity forward so you look at the

481
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,420
framework and then let's jump to the

482
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,519
goals real quick when you look at a zero

483
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,800
trust maturity model they really are

484
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
looking not only at the technology but

485
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,399
also the operational framework within

486
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,779
your organization

487
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,300
what this does is if you take a maturity

488
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,100
assessment the first thing you can do is

489
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,660
develop an Enterprise level strategy

490
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,100
because it allows you to know where to

491
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,540
start where you're most vulnerable and

492
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,800
where you're okay

493
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,079
allows you to determine an execution

494
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,060
roadmap and we'll give you a journey of

495
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
how we feel you should take that

496
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,279
approach

497
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,320
but um that execution roadmap gives you

498
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,420
a plan and it also gives you a

499
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,280
continuous delivery model it really sets

500
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,319
you up to where you can say now I know

501
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,880
where I need to deliver and what I need

502
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,640
to maintain to be you know under a zero

503
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,319
trust framework going forward

504
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,819
now some of the outcomes of the program

505
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,799
I think are important because it allows

506
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,619
you to say you know what I've got buy-in

507
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,119
from the executive team because I'm

508
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,380
doing the assessment and then I'm

509
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,880
building out the execution and plan to

510
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,640
align to that also lets me assess I have

511
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,799
some good technology I think every one

512
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,200
of the Enterprise customers I work with

513
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,940
all have something there that you can

514
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,220
start with it's mature at least it's in

515
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,260
a pretty good State and allows me to

516
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,360
then take my existing technology and

517
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,760
make it add value going forward it also

518
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
lets me identify where I've got gaps

519
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,000
things I need to actually bring into the

520
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
framework and last is by taking this

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,919
assessment approach by taking a zero

522
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,360
trust strategy you can actually put in

523
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,980
the framework and start to identify

524
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,660
where am I mature enough operationally

525
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,280
versus where I need to make some change

526
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,059
you know one thing to look at then is

527
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,520
take that framework take that assessment

528
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,919
level and this is a major eye chart so

529
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,480
I'm just going to highlight thematically

530
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,280
so you can see it but the material would

531
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,860
be left for you to reference but this

532
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,539
gives you a way to look at so from an

533
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,160
identity standpoint you know a company

534
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,900
like Ping would help you go up that

535
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,600
Journey ultimately go from password to

536
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,280
multi-factor authentication to actually

537
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,780
doing risk-based continuous

538
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,580
authentication something that I think is

539
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,100
critical the company like crowdstrike

540
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
would take you up the device path it

541
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,100
would take you from just a managed

542
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,720
device to be able to know about the

543
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,100
device and be able to lock down that

544
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,780
device and you can do that on each one

545
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,700
of these categories going forward

546
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,380
and I think the framework gives you a

547
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,020
way to say I'm going to start and all I

548
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,780
want to do is get my identity to that

549
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,940
kind of you know advanced level

550
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,220
but because our data is so critical I'm

551
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,900
going to get that up to the the higher

552
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,280
more of that optimal state so it gives

553
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,539
you a framework to make some of those

554
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,860
decisions

555
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,440
anything dad

556
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,539
no I'll talk a little bit more about

557
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,640
that aspect okay on one of my slides

558
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,679
later all right and then the last few

559
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,120
things is then is you take that

560
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,799
framework and then you need another

561
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,360
place to start it's really more of your

562
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,820
implementation strategy so

563
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,400
Our advice is that you build your

564
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,260
implementation strategy on how to

565
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,120
develop the best user experience and so

566
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,679
you take those same principles of

567
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,660
establish and build trust and then

568
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,280
protect your resources I know we have to

569
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,200
do them at the same time but from a

570
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
maturity standpoint if you can just

571
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,919
really lock down and make sure the um

572
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,200
the identity is authenticated and it's

573
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,539
paired with the device your ability to

574
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,919
then make sure that they are the right

575
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,720
user to be able to Grant access to what

576
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,940
they're entitled to is better so we talk

577
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,799
about establish you know your

578
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,200
authentication Authority First next you

579
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,880
establish your authorization Authority

580
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,039
so you not only can capture who they are

581
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,440
coming in once that session is

582
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,059
established now I can manage the

583
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,760
authorization in a continuous fashion

584
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,380
once those are established then you

585
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,240
start to provide intelligence so you go

586
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,280
up that single sign-on to multi-factor

587
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,559
authentication to risk you can start to

588
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,840
graduate and mature on that vein and

589
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,460
then always just the more you can start

590
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,260
to automate and provide that react

591
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,940
respond framework the more you can

592
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,760
actually bring some maturity in the

593
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,860
Insight that you provide you know we

594
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,840
then can start to have a really kind of

595
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
a security operations framework for your

596
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,340
zero trust deployment

597
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,080
so last few things here and I'm just

598
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,539
trying to be sensitive to time is that

599
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,760
there are some capabilities that are

600
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
necessary for what Ping believes is the

601
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
modern identity capability you need to

602
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,600
start with verifier verifiable

603
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,460
credentials that's for your employees if

604
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,960
you have a customer facing make sure

605
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
that you are introducing verifiable

606
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,580
credentials to ensure that you know who

607
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,320
they are those are really the implicit

608
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
ways of authenticating someone

609
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,580
profile Management's critical I can't

610
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,320
tell you how many companies we've worked

611
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,820
with that have been able to materially

612
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,100
change how they operate by putting in

613
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,200
Progressive profiling it allows you to

614
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,760
then create a good experience learn who

615
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,160
they are and be able to extend that risk

616
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,500
signals um you know if there's anything

617
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,059
that we've heard over the last two to

618
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,220
three years is the more signals I have

619
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,620
the better I know who you are and the

620
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,020
better experience I can give you you

621
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,760
actually take a lot of friction and you

622
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,919
imagine getting to that passwordless

623
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,240
state where you don't require password

624
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,100
to authenticate can actually be

625
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,020
achievable if you can actually have the

626
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,760
right signals to again know who you are

627
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,780
and then know is there any

628
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,700
vulnerabilities or not

629
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,380
the last few things then is just

630
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,179
multi-factor authentication still very

631
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,760
critical but multi-factor authentication

632
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,120
is becoming less and less explicit and

633
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,400
starting to enable implicit controls and

634
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
so imagine if I know who you are I know

635
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,440
and trust the device I know it's managed

636
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,659
I know I'm inside the firewall I'm going

637
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,059
to let you in I um well I know you well

638
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,559
enough and I trust well enough that I

639
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,419
can allow you a very seamless experience

640
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,900
versus if um you're brand new you may or

641
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,760
may not be a bot I really don't know who

642
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,500
you are I'm going to acquire a lot more

643
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,659
controls and I might require you to come

644
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,240
in with a stronger authentication and

645
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,559
then last is just the things we talked

646
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,820
about before the authentication

647
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,320
Authority and then the authorization

648
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,700
Authority

649
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,080
so I'm going to click through a few

650
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,299
slides fairly quickly but just try to

651
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,400
then tell that Journey so take those

652
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,440
capabilities we talked about and then

653
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,539
take that Journey first we start with

654
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,980
that authentication Authority and it

655
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,720
really is just to centralize and provide

656
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,940
single sun on everything you start to

657
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,679
look at adding multi-factor

658
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,880
authentication you start to then

659
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,620
identify and verify those users those

660
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,240
are great starting points because again

661
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,740
the better you know who the person is

662
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,539
you can grant them access to the

663
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,880
resources that you want to protect but

664
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,679
beyond that then you have some resources

665
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,080
and one of the most vulnerable places in

666
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,880
an

667
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,799
organization is their own people having

668
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,840
access to some of the back end systems

669
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,580
those admin accounts and so privilege

670
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,860
access is very important to imagine a

671
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,360
world if I could do single sign-on

672
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,159
across everything and then add

673
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,900
privileged accounts on top of that I

674
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,179
have a secure network for those those

675
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,679
infrastructure services that are there

676
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,659
and another thing to consider is then

677
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,419
managing those devices

678
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,039
Next Step then is once I've

679
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,600
authenticated I have a session

680
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,120
established now I need to provide you

681
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,620
know continuous authentication through

682
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,780
the flow first thing is to centralize

683
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,179
your access policies be able to have one

684
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,679
place that the security architect

685
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,840
controls and resources can come into

686
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
that Central authorization and say mayor

687
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,919
I may not access this application that

688
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,240
authentication I'm sorry the

689
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,919
authorization Authority can also take

690
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,020
signals so it can take information and

691
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,419
say you know I will grant you access but

692
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,620
you know what I've noticed you haven't

693
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,419
accessed that application for a long

694
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,120
time it's been over a month how about we

695
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,620
step you up and make sure that you

696
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,179
really are who you are before I grant

697
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,559
you access even though you're entitled

698
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,299
I'm going to still check to see who you

699
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,240
are and then last is that you know you

700
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,220
need to start working with the network

701
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,140
enforcement layers there's companies

702
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,200
like zscaler that sit at the edge and

703
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
they do a great job of interfacing with

704
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,100
identity provide protection to SAS

705
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,480
applications are out on the public

706
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,780
internet

707
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,440
so once we have the authentication

708
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,960
Authority the authorization Authority

709
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
centralized then we start to feed it and

710
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,740
this was really that story about that

711
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,960
large pharmaceutical company they got

712
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,940
everything protected the user experience

713
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,799
wasn't great because they had a lot of

714
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,659
explicit interfaces a lot of

715
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,000
authentication happening what they were

716
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,980
able to do is start to gather more and

717
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,900
more information that's really there for

718
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,640
security principles to help make better

719
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,620
decisions and then what it'll now

720
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,320
allowed them to do is then get to know

721
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,299
the user as they can allow them access

722
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,400
when they feel that they know the user

723
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,440
well and then step up and provide unique

724
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,539
policy when they don't

725
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,120
and then last is just on that notion of

726
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
once I've brought the signals in ensure

727
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,960
that you are working with some of those

728
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
Network providers to provide that

729
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,919
security Operating Center provide that

730
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,740
ability to very easily react and respond

731
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,919
and enforce certain policies one example

732
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,260
is you know we work well with a lot of

733
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,720
the network access gateways as well as

734
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,820
the API gateways and they become our

735
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,919
enforcement point for policy and it's

736
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,020
been a good tool to protect apis to

737
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,299
protect web resources or some data

738
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,980
resources

739
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,260
let me pause there and I apologize if

740
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,760
that felt rushed but happy to answer

741
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,320
questions or else we can talk to you

742
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,940
downstairs but I'm going to give Steve a

743
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,740
few minutes to talk about you know how

744
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,679
ping and CDW work together

745
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
so I'm not sure how many people are

746
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
familiar with CDW more

747
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,020
like the largest Security Solutions and

748
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,419
services provider in North America now

749
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,200
and when it comes down to the zero trust

750
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,260
and what we're we work with ping as far

751
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,960
as implementation Services uh managing

752
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,260
them sales but CDW as a whole does

753
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,940
everything on this eye chart so when

754
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,380
we're talking about identity network

755
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,080
security data application CDW can do

756
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,659
that implementation Services the other

757
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,460
thing that we provide is a we have a

758
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,440
zero trust rapid assessment

759
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,500
it takes about two weeks to complete and

760
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,299
we can give you a really good idea of

761
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,679
where your stand where you stand with

762
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,200
the zero trust as a whole and then help

763
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,640
you develop a plan to uh to get to that

764
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,460
to compliance with that framework and uh

765
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,340
and in general CDW across the board even

766
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,100
outside the zero trust we can do

767
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,840
everything from you know programming

768
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,520
strategy a lot of the customers that I

769
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,740
talk to I'm a field ceso I talk with

770
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,299
folks that a lot of them don't even have

771
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,340
a security

772
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,200
leader that's the director of I.T who's

773
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,419
also acting on behalf of the security

774
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,940
team and so you know I help them build

775
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,559
strategies around that and even through

776
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,539
training and some of the training would

777
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,100
probably be interesting to a lot of the

778
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,520
folks here as I walked around downstairs

779
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,539
because it's all developed around

780
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,299
security so malware reverse engineering

781
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,659
and if you're a sock if you're a like a

782
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,400
sock level one engineer if you want to

783
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
get to Sock level three engineer we can

784
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,480
actually give you a test to find out

785
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,799
where you're at and then develop the

786
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,419
training program that gets you up there

787
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,760
to build your security skills up but

788
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,860
again across secure infrastructure and

789
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,620
everything that needs to deal with

790
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,539
with zero trust because again it's not

791
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,179
just one thing you may hear vendors say

792
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,100
that you know if you use us we can get

793
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,260
you to zero trust compliance but not one

794
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,580
vendor's ever going to do that but we

795
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,919
can actually help Implement multiple

796
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,020
vendors and integrate them into a zero

797
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,460
trust framework

798
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,520
and that's it I'm done it's great so

799
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,760
questions who felt that was rushed

800
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,640
anyway it's a lot of slides to get to we

801
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,900
understand but we thought it would be

802
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,820
good to be content Rich

803
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,559
um you know leave it as leave behinds

804
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,820
give you the framework that you can work

805
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,658
from but any questions

806
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,340
there were an awful lot of areas that

807
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,779
had no partner names on there what do

808
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,679
you do

809
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,260
you know it's it's interesting how um

810
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,059
you know I had one other slide that was

811
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,740
way too busy that you know we actually

812
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,240
have Partners in every one of those

813
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,299
areas this was more of the landscape um

814
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,580
to fit what I think our core but take

815
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,799
like the software-defined perimeter

816
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,600
layer you know we work with Akamai where

817
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,919
we're quite clear trust we work with

818
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,360
some others in those areas so there's

819
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,919
our companies that we work with those

820
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
and we found that there's these

821
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
adjacencies that some of them are far

822
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,700
adjacencies in a different group but

823
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,220
we'll work with them so if you'd like a

824
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,860
follow-up I can certainly share that the

825
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,779
full breadth of those Partnerships that

826
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,000
sort of map to it and I can tell you

827
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,279
from my personal strategy is to look at

828
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,860
what you're currently invested in and

829
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,539
try to capitalize on that investment

830
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,279
which you've already built upon and then

831
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,440
finding the right Partners to build

832
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,360
around that to take up the other uh

833
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,700
their four pillars and integrate those

834
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,260
together and if you have something that

835
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,960
is uh you know not going to be part of

836
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,820
that framework very well then then we

837
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,559
can set it out another way to where

838
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,659
we'll end up getting you know doing the

839
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,960
entire implementation but I like to see

840
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,700
where you're at first and then find the

841
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,900
right partners that integrate well

842
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,159
because some Partners don't integrate

843
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,720
well with others

844
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,460
who

845
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,679
um is Palo Alto common among many other

846
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,580
groups

847
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,620
z-scaler

848
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,059
anyone on z-square we're starting to

849
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,620
hear Z scale a little more I think it's

850
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,840
because of that SAS application they

851
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,419
have that kind of edge piece

852
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,299
crowdstrike

853
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,120
film out there Cloud flare has anyone

854
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,980
heard of them cool

855
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,840
yeah I'd have to say it's been

856
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,539
interesting to go through zero trust

857
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,340
because you start to question you know

858
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,860
what how much do I need of Legacy

859
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,360
environments versus bring them forward

860
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,340
what we found is you do it's just a

861
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,779
matter of how do you best bring them

862
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,520
together there are some Edge

863
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
applications or technologies that I

864
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,659
think are going away

865
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,980
um you know I hate to say it but even

866
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,080
like the Sim vendors I think are quickly

867
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,179
being capped encapsulated captured by

868
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,659
the security orchestration automation

869
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,580
um you know response I guess the soar

870
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,539
vendors

871
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,820
and those are like the Palo alto's I

872
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,380
think you'll see crowdstrike positioning

873
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,480
around those and there's this xdr

874
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,760
Frameworks all those would be the kind

875
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,260
of conversation we would have if we get

876
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,940
into a little more detail

877
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,080
any any other questions

878
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,419
all right it's five o'clock you guys

879
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,100
were good you stuck with us so I

880
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,020
appreciate that I really do

881
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,179
and if you have questions I'll come up
